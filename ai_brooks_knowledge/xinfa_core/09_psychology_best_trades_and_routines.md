# Psychology, Best Trades, and Routines

This document captures psychological principles and routines for consistent trading.

## 1. Best Trades Concept

- Not all valid setups are “best trades.”  
- Best trades share:  
  - Clear regime (trend or mature range).  
  - Structure aligning with multiple factors (trend, support/resistance, time of day).  
  - Good trader’s equation: reasonable P(win) and favorable reward-to-risk.  
- The agent should aim to identify and trade only the best trades, not every possible signal.

## 2. Selectivity and Patience

- The market offers infinite potential trades; only a few per day are truly high quality.  
- Standing aside when context is poor is a positive decision.  
- Overtrading (too many trades) is a common cause of failure.

The agent should be biased toward saying “no trade” in ambiguous or low R:R conditions.

## 3. Handling Uncertainty and Ambiguity

- Most charts are not crystal clear. Trend and range evidence can conflict.  
- In ambiguous conditions, risk should be smaller, targets closer, or trades avoided.  
- Trying to force a trade in a confusing environment is dangerous.

## 4. Losses and Recovery

- Losses are inevitable. Sequences of losses can happen even with a good edge.  
- After significant losses:  
  - Reduce size or stop trading for the day.  
  - Avoid revenge trading and attempts to “win it all back quickly.”  
- The agent should enforce limits and recommend stopping when daily loss caps are hit.

## 5. Routine and Focus

- Focusing on one market and one timeframe (e.g., ES or SPY on 5-minute) helps build familiarity with typical behavior.  
- A consistent routine (pre-market review, opening assessment, midday check, closing review) improves performance.  
- For backtesting and live use, keeping a detailed trade log is essential for improving the playbook.

## 6. Human-Readable Explanations

Even though the agent is making decisions, explanations should be:

- Simple, consistent, and aligned with this playbook.  
- Focused on regime, structure, and risk rather than stories.  
- Designed so a human trader can understand, critique, and improve the agent’s decisions over time.
