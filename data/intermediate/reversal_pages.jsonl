Almost all of these trades require a spike in the direction of the trend before traders will have confidence.\nbarbwire A trading range of three or more bars that largely overlap and one or more is a doji. It is a type of tight trading range with prominent tails\nand often relatively large bars.\nbar pullback In an upswing, a bar pullback is a bar with a low below the low of the prior bar. In a downswing, it is a bar with a high above that of the\nprior bar.\nbear reversal A change in trend from up to down (a bear trend).\nblown account An account that your losses have reduced below the minimum margin requirements set by your broker, and you will not be allowed\nto place a trade unless you deposit more money.\nbreakout The high or low of the current bar extends beyond some prior price of significance such as a swing high or low, the high or low of any\nprior bar, a trend line, or a trend channel.\nbreakout bar (or bar breakout) A bar that creates a breakout. It is usually a strong trend bar.\nbreakout mode A setup where a breakout in either direction should have follow-through.\nbreakout pullback A small pullback of one to about five bars that occurs within a few bars after a breakout. Since you see it as a pullback, you are\nexpecting the breakout to resume and the pullback is a setup for that resumption. If instead you thought that the breakout would fail, you would not\nuse the term pullback and instead would see the pullback as a failed breakout. For example, if there was a five-bar breakout above a bear trend\nline but you believed that the bear trend would continue, you would be considering shorting this bear flag and not looking to buy a pullback\nimmediately after it broke out to the downside.\nbreakout test A breakout pullback that comes close to the original entry price to test a breakeven stop. It may overshoot it or undershoot it by a\nfew ticks. It can occur within a bar or two of entry or after an extended move or even 20 or more bars later.\nbull reversal A change in trend from a downtrend to an uptrend (a bull trend).\nbuying pressure Strong bulls are asserting themselves and their buying is creating bull trend bars, bars with tails at the bottoms, and two-bar bull\nreversals. The effect is cumulative and usually is eventually followed by higher prices.\ncandle A chart representation of price action in which the body is the area between the open and the close. If the close is above the open, it is a\nbull candle and is shown as white. If it is below, it is a bear candle and is black. The lines above and below are called tails (some technicians call\nthem wicks or shadows).\nchart type A line, bar, candle, volume, tick, or other type of chart.\nclimax A move that has gone too far too fast and has now reversed direction to either a trading range or an opposite trend. Most climaxes end with\ntrend channel overshoots and reversals, but most of those reversals result in trading ranges and not an opposite trend.\ncountertrend A trade or setup that is in the opposite direction from the current trend (the current always-in direction). This is a losing strategy for\nmost traders since the risk is usually at least as large as the reward and the probability is rarely high enough to make the trader’s equation\nfavorable.\ncountertrend scalp A trade taken in the belief that there is more to go in the trend but that a small pullback is due; you enter countertrend to\ncapture a small profit as that small pullback is forming. This is usually a mistake and should be avoided.\nday trade A trade where the intent is to exit on the day of entry.\ndirectional probability The probability that the market will move either up or down any number of ticks before it reaches a certain number of ticks\nin the opposite direction. If you are looking at an equidistant move up and down, it hovers around 50 percent most of the time, which means that\nthere is a 50–50 chance that the market will move up by X ticks before it moves down X ticks, and a 50–50 chance that it will move down X ticks\nbefore it moves up X ticks.\ndoji A candle with a small body or no body at all. On a 5 minute chart, the body would be only one or two ticks; but on a daily chart, the body might\nbe 10 or more ticks and still appear almost nonexistent. Neither the bulls nor the bears control the bar. All bars are either trend bars or nontrend\nbars, and those nontrend bars are called dojis.\ndouble bottom A chart formation in which the low of the current bar is about the same as the low of a prior swing low. That prior low can be just\none bar earlier or 20 or more bars earlier. It does not have to be at the low of the day, and it commonly forms in bull flags (a double bottom bull flag).\ndouble bottom bull flag A pause or bull flag in a bull trend that has two spikes down to around the same price and then reverses back into a bull\ntrend.\ndouble bottom pullback A buy setup composed of a double bottom followed by a deep pullback that forms a higher low.\ndouble top A chart formation in which the high of the current bar is about the same as the high of a prior swing high. That prior high can be just one\nbar earlier or 20 or more bars earlier. It does not have to be at the high of the day, and it commonly forms in bear flags (a double top bear flag).\ndouble top bear flag A pause or bear flag in a bear trend that has two spikes up to around the same price and then reverses back into a bear\ntrend.\ndouble top pullback A sell setup composed of a double top followed by a deep pullback that forms a lower high.\nearly longs Traders who buy as a bull signal bar is forming rather than waiting for it to close and then entering on a buy stop at one tick above its\nhigh.\nearly shorts Traders who sell as a bear signal bar is forming rather than waiting for it to close and then entering on a sell stop at one tick below its\nlow.\nedge A setup with a positive trader’s equation.

This is usually a mistake and should be avoided.\nday trade A trade where the intent is to exit on the day of entry.\ndirectional probability The probability that the market will move either up or down any number of ticks before it reaches a certain number of ticks in the opposite direction. If you are looking at an equidistant move up and down, it hovers around 50 percent most of the time, which means that there is a 50–50 chance that the market will move up by X ticks before it moves down X ticks, and a 50–50 chance that it will move down X ticks before it moves up X ticks.\ndoji A candle with a small body or no body at all. On a 5 minute chart, the body would be only one or two ticks; but on a daily chart, the body might be 10 or more ticks and still appear almost nonexistent. Neither the bulls nor the bears control the bar. All bars are either trend bars or nontrend bars, and those nontrend bars are called dojis.\ndouble bottom A chart formation in which the low of the current bar is about the same as the low of a prior swing low. That prior low can be just one bar earlier or 20 or more bars earlier. It does not have to be at the low of the day, and it commonly forms in bull flags (a double bottom bull flag).\ndouble bottom bull flag A pause or bull flag in a bull trend that has two spikes down to around the same price and then reverses back into a bull trend.\ndouble bottom pullback A buy setup composed of a double bottom followed by a deep pullback that forms a higher low.\ndouble top A chart formation in which the high of the current bar is about the same as the high of a prior swing high. That prior high can be just one bar earlier or 20 or more bars earlier. It does not have to be at the high of the day, and it commonly forms in bear flags (a double top bear flag).\ndouble top bear flag A pause or bear flag in a bear trend that has two spikes up to around the same price and then reverses back into a bear trend.\ndouble top pullback A sell setup composed of a double top followed by a deep pullback that forms a lower high.\nearly longs Traders who buy as a bull signal bar is forming rather than waiting for it to close and then entering on a buy stop at one tick above its high.\nearly shorts Traders who sell as a bear signal bar is forming rather than waiting for it to close and then entering on a sell stop at one tick below its low.\nedge A setup with a positive trader’s equation.

For example, if a trader looks back at the most recent 100 times a certain setup led to a trade and finds that it\nled to a profitable trade 60 times, then that would indicate that the setup has about a 60 percent probability of success.

For example, if there is a strong bull trend bar and the low of the bar after it is at or above the high of the bar before it, the midpoint between that low and that high is the micro measuring gap.\nmicro trend channel line A trend channel line drawn across the highs or lows of three to five consecutive bars.\nmicro trend line breakout A trend line on any time frame that is drawn across from two to about 10 bars where most of the bars touch or are close to the trend line, and then one of the bars has a false breakout through the trend line. This false breakout sets up a with-trend entry. If it fails within a bar or two, then there is usually a countertrend trade.\nmoney stop A stop based on a fixed dollar amount or number of points, like two points in the Eminis or a dollar in a stock.\nmoving average The charts in this book use a 20-bar exponential moving average, but any moving average can be useful.\nmoving average gap bar (gap bar) A bar that does not touch the moving average. The space between the bar and the moving average is the gap. The first pullback in a strong trend that results in a moving average gap bar is usually followed by a test of the trend’s extreme. For example, when there is a strong bull trend and there is a pullback that finally has a bar with a high below the moving average, this is often a buy setup for a test of the high of the trend.\nnesting Sometimes a pattern has a smaller version of a comparable pattern “nested” within it. For example, it is common for the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top to be either a small head and shoulders top or a double top.\nnews Useless information generated by the media for the sole purpose of selling advertising and making money for the media company. It is unrelated to trading, is impossible to evaluate, and should always be ignored.\noio Outside-inside-outside, an outside bar followed by an inside bar, followed by an outside bar.\noo Outside-outside, an outside bar followed by a larger outside bar.\nopening reversal A reversal in the first hour or so of the day.\noutside bar A bar with a high that is above or at the high of the prior bar and a low that is below the low of the prior bar, or a bar with a low that is below or at the low of the prior bar and a high that is above the high of the prior bar.\noutside down bar An outside bar with a close below its open.\noutside up bar An outside bar with a close above its open.\novershoot The market surpasses a prior price of significance like a swing point or a trend line.\npause bar A bar that does not extend the trend. In a bull trend, a pause bar has a high that is at or below the prior bar, or a small bar with a high that is only a tick or so higher than the previous bar when the previous bar is a strong bull trend bar. It is a type of pullback.\npip A tick in the foreign exchange (forex) market. However, some data vendors provide quotes with an extra decimal place, which should be ignored.\npressing their longs In a bull trend, bulls add to their longs as in a bull spike and as the market breaks out to a new high, because they expect another leg up to about a measured move.\npressing their shorts In a bear trend, bears add to their shorts in a bear spike and as the market breaks out to a new low, because they expect another leg down to about a measured move.\nprice action Any change in price on any chart type or time frame.\nprobability The chance of success. For example, if a trader looks back at the most recent 100 times a certain setup led to a trade and finds that it led to a profitable trade 60 times, then that would indicate that the setup has about a 60 percent probability of success. There are many variables that can never be fully tested, so probabilities are only approximations and at times can be very misleading.\nprobably At least 60 percent certain.\npullback A temporary pause or countertrend move that is part of a trend, swing, or leg and does not retrace beyond the start of the trend, swing, or leg. It is a small trading range where traders expect the trend to resume soon. For example, a bear pullback is a sideways to upward move in a bear trend, swing, or leg that will be followed by at least a test of the prior low. It can be as small as a one-tick move above the high of the prior bar or it can even be a pause, like an inside bar.\npullback bar A bar that reverses the prior bar by at least one tick. In an uptrend, it is a bar with a low below that of the prior bar.\nreasonable A setup with a favorable trader’s equation.", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["futures.", "lower high A swing high that is lower than a previous swing high.", "lower low A swing low that is lower than a previous swing low.", "low 1, 2, 3, or 4 A low 1 is a bar with a low below the prior bar in a bear flag or near the top of a trading range.

However, trading range behavior is opposite to trending behavior, so when a trend becomes a trading range, this is also\na reversal. When a trading range becomes a trend, it is a reversal but is usually called a breakout.\nreversal bar A trend bar in the opposite direction of the trend. When a bear leg is reversing up, a bull reversal bar is a bull trend bar, and the\nclassic description includes a tail at the bottom and a close above the open and near the top. A bear reversal bar is a bear trend bar in a bull leg,\nand the traditional description includes a tail at the top and a close below the open and near the bottom.\nreward The number of ticks that a trader expects to make from a trade. For example, if the trader exits with a limit order at a profit target, it is the\nnumber of ticks between the entry price and the profit target.\nrisk The number of ticks from a trader’s entry price to a protective stop. It is the minimum that the trader will lose if a trade goes against him\n(slippage and other factors can make the actual risk greater than the theoretical risk).\nrisk off When traders think that the stock market will fall, they become risk averse, sell out of volatile stocks and currencies, and transition into safe-\nhaven investments, like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Altria Group (MO), Procter & Gamble (PG), the U.S. dollar, and the Swiss franc.\nrisk on When traders think that the stock market is strong, they are willing to take more risks and invest in stocks that tend to rise faster than the\noverall market, and invest in more volatile currencies, like the Australian dollar or the Swedish krona.\nrisky When the trader’s equation is unclear or barely favorable for a trade. It can also mean that the probability of success for a trade is 50 percent\nor less, regardless of the risk and potential reward.\nscalp A trade that is exited with a small profit, usually before there are any pullbacks. In the Emini, when the average range is about 10 to 15 points,\na scalp trade is usually any trade where the goal is less than four points. For the SPY or stocks, it might be 10 to 30 cents. For more expensive\nstocks, it can be $1 to $2. Since the profit is often smaller than the risk, a trader has to win at least 70 percent of the time, which is an unrealistic\ngoal for most traders.

The potential reward is usually at least as large as\nthe risk. Small swing trades are called scalps by many traders. In the Emini, when the average range is about 10 to 15 points, a swing trade is\nusually any trade where the goal is four or more points.\ntest When the market approaches a prior price of significance and can overshoot or undershoot the target. The term failed test is used to mean\nopposite things by different traders. Most traders believe that if the market then reverses, the test was successful, and if it does not and the move\ncontinues beyond the test area, the test failed and a breakout has occurred.\nthree pushes Three swing highs where each swing high is usually higher or three swing lows where each swing low is usually lower. It trades the\nsame as a wedge and should be considered a variant. When it is part of a flag, the move can be mostly horizontal and each push does not have to\nextend beyond the prior one. For example, in a wedge bull flag or any other type of triangle, the second push down can be at, above, or below the\nfirst, and the third push down can be at, above, or below either the second or the first, or both.\ntick The smallest unit of price movement. For most stocks, it is one penny; for 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures, it is 1/64th of a point; and for\nEminis, it is 0.25 points. On tick charts and on time and sales tables, a tick is every trade that takes place no matter the size and even if there is no\nprice change. If you look at a time and sales table, every trade is counted as one tick when TradeStation charting software creates a tick chart.\ntight channel A channel where the trend line and trend channel line are close together, and the pullbacks are small and last for only one to three\nbars.\ntight trading range A trading range of two or more bars with lots of overlap in the bars and in which most reversals are too small to trade profitably\nwith stop entries. The bulls and bears are in balance.\ntime frame The length of time contained in one bar on the chart (a 5 minute time frame is made of bars that close every five minutes). It can also\nrefer to bars not based on time, such as those based on volume or the number of ticks traded.\ntradable A setup that you believe has a reasonable chance of leading to at least a scalper’s profit.\ntrader’s equation To take a trade, you must believe that the probability of success times the potential reward is greater than the probability of\nfailure times the risk. You set the reward and risk because the potential reward is the distance to your profit target and the risk is the distance to\nyour stop. The difficulty in solving the equation is assigning a value to the probability, which can never be known with certainty. As a guideline, if you\nare uncertain, assume that you have a 50 percent chance of winning or losing, and if you are confident, assume that you have a 60 percent chance\nof winning and a 40 percent chance of losing.\ntrading range The minimum requirement is a single bar with a range that is largely overlapped by the bar before it. It is sideways movement and\nneither the bull nor the bears are in control, although one side is often stronger. It is often a pullback in a trend where the pullback has lasted long\nenough to lose most of its certainty. In other words, traders have become uncertain about the direction of the breakout in the short term, and the\nmarket will have repeated breakout attempts up and down that will fail. It will usually ultimately break out in the direction of the trend, and is a\npullback on a higher time frame chart.\ntrailing a stop As the trade becomes increasingly profitable, traders will often move, or trail, the protective stop to protect more of their open profit.\nFor example, if they are long in a bull trend, every time the market moves to a new high, they might raise the protective stop to just below the most\nrecent higher low.\ntrap An entry that immediately reverses to the opposite direction before a scalper’s profit target is reached, trapping traders in their new position\nand ultimately forcing them to cover at a loss. It can also scare traders out of a good trade.\ntrapped in a trade A trader with an open loss on a trade that did not result in a scalper’s profit, and if there is a pullback beyond the entry or signal\nbars, the trader will likely exit with a loss.\ntrapped out of a trade A pullback that scares a trader into exiting a trade, but then the pullback fails. The move quickly resumes in the direction of\nthe trade, making it difficult emotionally for the trader to get back in at the worse price that is now available. The trader will have to chase the\nmarket.\ntrend A series of price changes that are either mostly up (a bull trend) or down (a bear trend). There are three loosely defined smaller versions:\nswings, legs, and pullbacks. A chart will show only one or two major trends. If there are more, one of the other terms is more appropriate.\ntrend bar A bar with a body, which means that the close was above or below the open, indicating that there is at least a minor price movement.\ntrend channel line A line in the direction of the trend but drawn on the opposite side of the bars compared to a trend line. A bull trend channel line\nis above the highs and rising to the right, and a bear trend channel line is below the lows and falling to the right.\ntrend channel line overshoot One or more bars penetrating a trend channel line.\ntrend channel line undershoot A bar approaches a trend channel line but the market reverses away from the line without reaching or penetrating\nit.\ntrend from the open A trend that begins at the first or one of the first bars of the day and extends for many bars without a pullback, and the start of\nthe trend remains as one of the extremes of the day for much if not all of the day.\ntrending closes Three or more bars where the closes are trending. In a bull trend, each close is above the prior close, and in a bear trend, each\nclose is lower. If the pattern extends for many bars, there can be one or two bars where the closes are not trending.\ntrending highs or lows The same as trending closes except based on the highs or lows of the bars.\ntrending swings Three or more swings where the swing highs and lows are both higher than the prior swing highs and lows (trending bull swings),\nor both lower (trending bear swings).\ntrending trading ranges Two or more trading ranges separated by a breakout.\ntrend line A line drawn in the direction of the trend; it is sloped up and is below the bars in a bull trend, and it is sloped down and is above the bars\nin a bear trend. Most often, it is constructed from either swing highs or swing lows but can be based on linear regression or just a best fit\n(eyeballing).\ntrend reversal A trend change from up to down or down to up, or from a trend to a trading range.\n20 moving average gap bars Twenty or more consecutive bars that have not touched the moving average. Once the market finally touches the\nmoving average, it usually creates a setup for a test of the trend’s extreme.\nundershoot The market approaches but does not reach a prior price of significance like a swing point or a trend line.\nunlikely At most 40 percent certain.\nunreasonable A setup with an unfavorable trader’s equation.\n", "text_clean": "part of the trade is held without a profit target, since the trader is hoping for an extended move. The potential reward is usually at least as large as the risk. Small swing trades are called scalps by many traders. In the Emini, when the average range is about 10 to 15 points, a swing trade is usually any trade where the goal is four or more points.\ntest When the market approaches a prior price of significance and can overshoot or undershoot the target. The term failed test is used to mean opposite things by different traders. Most traders believe that if the market then reverses, the test was successful, and if it does not and the move continues beyond the test area, the test failed and a breakout has occurred.\nthree pushes Three swing highs where each swing high is usually higher or three swing lows where each swing low is usually lower. It trades the same as a wedge and should be considered a variant. When it is part of a flag, the move can be mostly horizontal and each push does not have to extend beyond the prior one. For example, in a wedge bull flag or any other type of triangle, the second push down can be at, above, or below the first, and the third push down can be at, above, or below either the second or the first, or both.\ntick The smallest unit of price movement. For most stocks, it is one penny; for 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures, it is 1/64th of a point; and for Eminis, it is 0.25 points. On tick charts and on time and sales tables, a tick is every trade that takes place no matter the size and even if there is no price change. If you look at a time and sales table, every trade is counted as one tick when TradeStation charting software creates a tick chart.\ntight channel A channel where the trend line and trend channel line are close together, and the pullbacks are small and last for only one to three bars.\ntight trading range A trading range of two or more bars with lots of overlap in the bars and in which most reversals are too small to trade profitably with stop entries. The bulls and bears are in balance.\ntime frame The length of time contained in one bar on the chart (a 5 minute time frame is made of bars that close every five minutes). It can also refer to bars not based on time, such as those based on volume or the number of ticks traded.\ntradable A setup that you believe has a reasonable chance of leading to at least a scalper’s profit.\ntrader’s equation To take a trade, you must believe that the probability of success times the potential reward is greater than the probability of failure times the risk. You set the reward and risk because the potential reward is the distance to your profit target and the risk is the distance to your stop. The difficulty in solving the equation is assigning a value to the probability, which can never be known with certainty. As a guideline, if you are uncertain, assume that you have a 50 percent chance of winning or losing, and if you are confident, assume that you have a 60 percent chance of winning and a 40 percent chance of losing.\ntrading range The minimum requirement is a single bar with a range that is largely overlapped by the bar before it. It is sideways movement and neither the bull nor the bears are in control, although one side is often stronger. It is often a pullback in a trend where the pullback has lasted long enough to lose most of its certainty. In other words, traders have become uncertain about the direction of the breakout in the short term, and the market will have repeated breakout attempts up and down that will fail. It will usually ultimately break out in the direction of the trend, and is a pullback on a higher time frame chart.\ntrailing a stop As the trade becomes increasingly profitable, traders will often move, or trail, the protective stop to protect more of their open profit.\nFor example, if they are long in a bull trend, every time the market moves to a new high, they might raise the protective stop to just below the most recent higher low.\ntrap An entry that immediately reverses to the opposite direction before a scalper’s profit target is reached, trapping traders in their new position and ultimately forcing them to cover at a loss. It can also scare traders out of a good trade.\ntrapped in a trade A trader with an open loss on a trade that did not result in a scalper’s profit, and if there is a pullback beyond the entry or signal bars, the trader will likely exit with a loss.\ntrapped out of a trade A pullback that scares a trader into exiting a trade, but then the pullback fails. The move quickly resumes in the direction of the trade, making it difficult emotionally for the trader to get back in at the worse price that is now available. The trader will have to chase the market.\ntrend A series of price changes that are either mostly up (a bull trend) or down (a bear trend). There are three loosely defined smaller versions:\nswings, legs, and pullbacks. A chart will show only one or two major trends. If there are more, one of the other terms is more appropriate.\ntrend bar A bar with a body, which means that the close was above or below the open, indicating that there is at least a minor price movement.\ntrend channel line A line in the direction of the trend but drawn on the opposite side of the bars compared to a trend line. A bull trend channel line is above the highs and rising to the right, and a bear trend channel line is below the lows and falling to the right.\ntrend channel line overshoot One or more bars penetrating a trend channel line.\ntrend channel line undershoot A bar approaches a trend channel line but the market reverses away from the line without reaching or penetrating it.\ntrend from the open A trend that begins at the first or one of the first bars of the day and extends for many bars without a pullback, and the start of the trend remains as one of the extremes of the day for much if not all of the day.\ntrending closes Three or more bars where the closes are trending. In a bull trend, each close is above the prior close, and in a bear trend, each close is lower. If the pattern extends for many bars, there can be one or two bars where the closes are not trending.\ntrending highs or lows The same as trending closes except based on the highs or lows of the bars.\ntrending swings Three or more swings where the swing highs and lows are both higher than the prior swing highs and lows (trending bull swings), or both lower (trending bear swings).\ntrending trading ranges Two or more trading ranges separated by a breakout.\ntrend line A line drawn in the direction of the trend; it is sloped up and is below the bars in a bull trend, and it is sloped down and is above the bars in a bear trend. Most often, it is constructed from either swing highs or swing lows but can be based on linear regression or just a best fit (eyeballing).\ntrend reversal A trend change from up to down or down to up, or from a trend to a trading range.\n20 moving average gap bars Twenty or more consecutive bars that have not touched the moving average.

It takes thousands of hours, and the financial\nreward is meager compared to that from trading. However, with my three girls now away in grad school, I have a void to fill and this has been a very\nsatisfying project. I originally planned on updating the first edition of Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar (John Wiley & Sons, 2009), but as I got into\nit, I decided instead to go into great detail about how I view and trade the markets. I am metaphorically teaching you how to play the violin.\nEverything you need to know to make a living at it is in these books, but it is up to you to spend the countless hours learning your trade. After a year\nof answering thousands of questions from traders on my website at www.brookspriceaction.com, I think that I have found ways to express my ideas\nmuch more clearly, and these books should be easier to read than that one. The earlier book focused on reading price action, and this series of\nbooks is instead centered on how to use price action to trade the markets. Since the book grew to more than four times as many words as the first\nbook, John Wiley & Sons decided to divide it into three separate books. This first book covers price action basics and trends. The second book is\non trading ranges, order management, and the mathematics of trading, and the final book is about trend reversals, day trading, daily charts,\noptions, and the best setups for all time frames. Many of the charts are also in Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar, but most have been updated and\nthe discussion about the charts has also been largely rewritten. Only about 5 percent of the 120,000 words from that book are present in the\n570,000 words in this new series, so readers will find little duplication.\nMy goals in writing this series of three books are to describe my understanding of why the carefully selected trades offer great risk/reward ratios,\nand to present ways to profit from the setups. I am presenting material that I hope will be interesting to professional traders and students in\nbusiness school, but I also hope that even traders starting out will find some useful ideas. Everyone looks at price charts but usually just briefly and\nwith a specific or limited goal. However, every chart has an incredible amount of information that can be used to make profitable trades, but much\nof it can be used effectively only if traders spend time to carefully understand what each bar on the chart is telling them about what institutional\nmoney is doing.\nNinety percent or more of all trading in large markets is done by institutions, which means that the market is simply a collection of institutions.\nAlmost all are profitable over time, and the few that are not soon go out of business. Since institutions are profitable and they are the market, every\ntrade that you take has a profitable trader (a part of the collection of institutions) taking the other side of your trade. No trade can take place without\none institution willing to take one side and another willing to take the other. The small-volume trades made by individuals can only take place if an\ninstitution is willing to take the same trade. If you want to buy at a certain price, the market will not get to that price unless one or more institutions\nalso want to buy at that price. You cannot sell at any price unless one or more institutions are willing to sell there, because the market can only go to\na price where there are institutions willing to buy and others willing to sell. If the Emini is at 1,264 and you are long with a protective sell stop at\n1,262, your stop cannot get hit unless there is an institution who is also willing to sell at 1,262. This is true for virtually all trades.\nIf you trade 200 Emini contracts, then you are trading institutional volume and are effectively an institution, and you will sometimes be able to\nmove the market a tick or two. Most individual traders, however, have no ability to move the market, no matter how stupidly they are willing to trade.\nThe market will not run your stops. The market might test the price where your protective stop is, but it has nothing to do with your stop. It will only\ntest that price if one or more institutions believe that it is financially sound to sell there and other institutions believe that it is profitable to buy there.\nAt every tick, there are institutions buying and other institutions selling, and all have proven systems that will make money by placing those trades.\nYou should always be trading in the direction of the majority of institutional dollars because they control where the market is heading.\nAt the end of the day when you look at a printout of the day’s chart, how can you tell what the institutions did during the day? The answer is simple:\nwhenever the market went up, the bulk of institutional money was buying, and whenever the market went down, more money went into selling. Just\nlook at any segment of the chart where the market went up or down and study every bar, and you will soon notice many repeatable patterns. With\ntime, you will begin to see those patterns unfold in real time, and that will give you confidence to place your trades. Some of the price action is\nsubtle, so be open to every possibility. For example, sometimes when the market is working higher, a bar will trade below the low of the prior bar,\nyet the trend continues higher. You have to assume that the big money was buying at and below the low of that prior bar, and that is also what many\nexperienced traders were doing. They bought exactly where weak traders let themselves get stopped out with a loss or where other weak traders\nshorted, believing that the market was beginning to sell off. Once you get comfortable with the idea that strong trends often have pullbacks and big\nmoney is buying them rather than selling them, you will be in a position to make some great trades that you previously thought were exactly the\nwrong thing to do. Don’t think too hard about it. If the market is going up, institutions are buying constantly, even at times when you think that you\nshould stop yourself out of your long with a loss. Your job is to follow their behavior and not use too much logic to deny what is happening right in\nfront of you. It does not matter if it seems counterintuitive. All that matters is that the market is going up and therefore institutions are predominantly\nbuying and so should you.\nInstitutions are generally considered to be smart money, meaning that they are smart enough to make a living by trading and they trade a large\nvolume every day. Television still uses the term institution to refer to traditional institutions like mutual funds, banks, brokerage houses, insurance\ncompanies, pension funds, and hedge funds; these companies used to account for most of the volume, and they mostly trade on fundamentals.\nTheir trading controls the direction of the market on daily and weekly charts and a lot of the big intraday swings. Until a decade or so ago, most of\nthe trade decisions were made and most trading was done by very smart traders, but it is now increasingly being done by computers. They have\nprograms that can instantly analyze economic data and immediately place trades based on that analysis, without a person ever being involved in\nthe trade. In addition, other firms trade huge volumes by using computer programs that place trades based on the statistical analysis of price\naction. Computer-generated trading now accounts for as much as 70 percent of the day’s volume.\nComputers are very good at making decisions, and playing chess and winning at Jeopardy! are more difficult than trading stocks. Gary\nKasparov for years made the best chess decisions in the world, yet a computer made better decisions in 1997 and beat him. Ken Jennings was\nheralded as the greatest Jeopardy! player of all time, yet a computer destroyed him in 2011. It is only a matter of time before computers are widely\naccepted as the best decision makers for institutional trading.\nSince programs use objective mathematical analysis, there should be a tendency for support and resistance areas to become more clearly\ndefined. For example, measured move projections should become more precise as more of the volume is traded based on precise mathematical\nlogic. Also, there might be a tendency toward more protracted tight channels as programs buy small pullbacks on the daily chart. However, if\nenough programs exit longs or go short at the same key levels, sell-offs might become larger and faster. Will the changes be dramatic? Probably\nnot, since the same general forces were operating when everything was done manually, but nonetheless there should be some move toward\nmathematical perfection as more of the emotion is removed from trading.

Ken Jennings was heralded as the greatest Jeopardy! player of all time, yet a computer destroyed him in 2011. It is only a matter of time before computers are widely accepted as the best decision makers for institutional trading.\nSince programs use objective mathematical analysis, there should be a tendency for support and resistance areas to become more clearly defined. For example, measured move projections should become more precise as more of the volume is traded based on precise mathematical logic. Also, there might be a tendency toward more protracted tight channels as programs buy small pullbacks on the daily chart. However, if enough programs exit longs or go short at the same key levels, sell-offs might become larger and faster. Will the changes be dramatic? Probably not, since the same general forces were operating when everything was done manually, but nonetheless there should be some move toward mathematical perfection as more of the emotion is removed from trading.

No, because the institutions control the\nmarket and they already have the smartest traders in the world and those traders already know everything in these books, at least intuitively. At\nevery moment, there is an extremely smart institutional bull taking the opposite side of the trade being placed by an extremely smart institutional\nbear. Since the most important players already know price action, having more players know it will not tip the balance one way or the other. I\ntherefore have no concern that what I am writing will stop price action from working. Because of that balance, any edge that anyone has is always\ngoing to be extremely small, and any small mistake will result in a loss, no matter how well a person reads a chart. Although it is very difficult to\nmake money as a trader without understanding price action, that knowledge alone is not enough. It takes a long time to learn how to trade after a\ntrader learns to read charts, and trading is just as difficult as chart reading. I wrote these books to help people learn to read charts better and to\ntrade better, and if you can do both well, you deserve to be able to take money from the accounts of others and put it into yours.\nThe reason why the patterns that we all see do unfold as they do is because that is the appearance that occurs in an efficient market with\ncountless traders placing orders for thousands of different reasons, but with the controlling volume being traded based on sound logic. That is just\nwhat it looks like, and it has been that way forever. The same patterns unfold in all time frames in all markets around the world, and it would simply\nbe impossible for all of it to be manipulated instantaneously on so many different levels. Price action is a manifestation of human behavior and\ntherefore actually has a genetic basis. Until we evolve, it will likely remain largely unchanged, just as it has been unchanged for the 80 years of\ncharts that I have reviewed. Program trading might have changed the appearance slightly, although I can find no evidence to support that theory. If\nanything, it would make the charts smoother because it is unemotional and it has greatly increased the volume. Now that most of the volume is\nbeing traded automatically by computers and the volume is so huge, irrational and emotional behavior is an insignificant component of the markets\nand the charts are a purer expression of human tendencies.\nSince price action comes from our DNA, it will not change until we evolve. When you look at the two charts in Figure I.1, your first reaction is that\nthey are just a couple of ordinary charts, but look at the dates at the bottom. These weekly Dow Jones Industrial Average charts from the\nDepression era and from World War II have the same patterns that we see today on all charts, despite most of today’s volume being traded by\ncomputers.\nFIGURE I.1 Price Action Has Not Changed over Time\nIf everyone suddenly became a price action scalper, the smaller patterns might change a little for a while, but over time, the efficient market will\nwin out and the votes by all traders will get distilled into standard price action patterns because that is the inescapable result of countless people\nbehaving logically. Also, the reality is that it is very difficult to trade well, and although basing trades on price action is a sound approach, it is still\nvery difficult to do successfully in real time. There just won’t be enough traders doing it well enough, all at the same time, to have any significant\ninfluence over time on the patterns. Just look at Edwards and Magee. The best traders in the world have been using those ideas for decades and\nthey continue to work, again for the same reason—charts look the way they do because that is the unchangeable fingerprint of an efficient market\nfilled with a huge number of smart people using a huge number of approaches and time frames, all trying to make the most money that they can.\nFor example, Tiger Woods is not hiding anything that he does in golf, and anyone is free to copy him. However, very few people can play golf well\nenough to make a living at it. The same is true of trading. A trader can know just about everything there is to know and still lose money because\napplying all that knowledge in a way that consistently makes money is very difficult to do.\nWhy do so many business schools continue to recommend Edwards and Magee when their book is essentially simplistic, largely using trend\nlines, breakouts, and pullbacks as the basis for trading? It is because it works and it always has and it always will. Now that just about all traders\nhave computers with access to intraday data, many of those techniques can be adapted to day trading. Also, candle charts give additional\ninformation about who is controlling the market, which results in a more timely entry with smaller risk. Edwards and Magee’s focus is on the overall\ntrend. I use those same basic techniques but pay much closer attention to the individual bars on the chart to improve the risk/reward ratio, and I\ndevote considerable attention to intraday charts.\nIt seemed obvious to me that if one could simply read the charts well enough to be able to enter at the exact times when the move would take off\nand not come back, then that trader would have a huge advantage. The trader would have a high winning percentage, and the few losses would be\nsmall. I decided that this would be my starting point, and what I discovered was that nothing had to be added. In fact, any additions are distractions\nthat result in lower profitability. This sounds so obvious and easy that it is difficult for most people to believe.\nI am a day trader who relies entirely on price action on the intraday Emini S&P 500 Futures charts, and I believe that reading price action well is\nan invaluable skill for all traders. Beginners often instead have a deep-seated belief that something more is required, that maybe some complex\nmathematical formula that very few use would give them just the edge that they need. Goldman Sachs is so rich and sophisticated that its traders\nmust have a supercomputer and high-powered software that gives them an advantage that ensures that all the individual traders are doomed to\nfailure. They start looking at all kinds of indicators and playing with the inputs to customize the indicators to make them just right. Every indicator\nworks some of the time, but for me, they obfuscate instead of elucidate. In fact, without even looking at a chart, you can place a buy order and have\n", "text_clean": "them into the red and make them too scared to continue using that approach.\nShould you be concerned that making the information in these books available will create lots of great price action traders, all doing the same thing at the same time, thereby removing the late entrants needed to drive the market to your price target?

I wrote these books to help people learn to read charts better and to trade better, and if you can do both well, you deserve to be able to take money from the accounts of others and put it into yours.\nThe reason why the patterns that we all see do unfold as they do is because that is the appearance that occurs in an efficient market with countless traders placing orders for thousands of different reasons, but with the controlling volume being traded based on sound logic. That is just what it looks like, and it has been that way forever. The same patterns unfold in all time frames in all markets around the world, and it would simply be impossible for all of it to be manipulated instantaneously on so many different levels. Price action is a manifestation of human behavior and therefore actually has a genetic basis. Until we evolve, it will likely remain largely unchanged, just as it has been unchanged for the 80 years of charts that I have reviewed. Program trading might have changed the appearance slightly, although I can find no evidence to support that theory. If anything, it would make the charts smoother because it is unemotional and it has greatly increased the volume. Now that most of the volume is being traded automatically by computers and the volume is so huge, irrational and emotional behavior is an insignificant component of the markets and the charts are a purer expression of human tendencies.\nSince price action comes from our DNA, it will not change until we evolve. When you look at the two charts in Figure I.1, your first reaction is that they are just a couple of ordinary charts, but look at the dates at the bottom. These weekly Dow Jones Industrial Average charts from the Depression era and from World War II have the same patterns that we see today on all charts, despite most of today’s volume being traded by computers.\nFIGURE I.1 Price Action Has Not Changed over Time If everyone suddenly became a price action scalper, the smaller patterns might change a little for a while, but over time, the efficient market will win out and the votes by all traders will get distilled into standard price action patterns because that is the inescapable result of countless people behaving logically. Also, the reality is that it is very difficult to trade well, and although basing trades on price action is a sound approach, it is still very difficult to do successfully in real time. There just won’t be enough traders doing it well enough, all at the same time, to have any significant influence over time on the patterns. Just look at Edwards and Magee. The best traders in the world have been using those ideas for decades and they continue to work, again for the same reason—charts look the way they do because that is the unchangeable fingerprint of an efficient market filled with a huge number of smart people using a huge number of approaches and time frames, all trying to make the most money that they can.\nFor example, Tiger Woods is not hiding anything that he does in golf, and anyone is free to copy him. However, very few people can play golf well enough to make a living at it. The same is true of trading. A trader can know just about everything there is to know and still lose money because applying all that knowledge in a way that consistently makes money is very difficult to do.\nWhy do so many business schools continue to recommend Edwards and Magee when their book is essentially simplistic, largely using trend lines, breakouts, and pullbacks as the basis for trading? It is because it works and it always has and it always will. Now that just about all traders have computers with access to intraday data, many of those techniques can be adapted to day trading. Also, candle charts give additional information about who is controlling the market, which results in a more timely entry with smaller risk. Edwards and Magee’s focus is on the overall trend. I use those same basic techniques but pay much closer attention to the individual bars on the chart to improve the risk/reward ratio, and I devote considerable attention to intraday charts.\nIt seemed obvious to me that if one could simply read the charts well enough to be able to enter at the exact times when the move would take off and not come back, then that trader would have a huge advantage. The trader would have a high winning percentage, and the few losses would be small. I decided that this would be my starting point, and what I discovered was that nothing had to be added. In fact, any additions are distractions that result in lower profitability. This sounds so obvious and easy that it is difficult for most people to believe.\nI am a day trader who relies entirely on price action on the intraday Emini S&P 500 Futures charts, and I believe that reading price action well is an invaluable skill for all traders. Beginners often instead have a deep-seated belief that something more is required, that maybe some complex mathematical formula that very few use would give them just the edge that they need. Goldman Sachs is so rich and sophisticated that its traders must have a supercomputer and high-powered software that gives them an advantage that ensures that all the individual traders are doomed to failure. They start looking at all kinds of indicators and playing with the inputs to customize the indicators to make them just right. Every indicator works some of the time, but for me, they obfuscate instead of elucidate.

The\nmarket is almost certainly transitioning into a trading range and possibly into a bear trend. Traders don’t need an oscillator to tell them this. Also,\noscillators tend to make traders look for reversals and focus less on price charts. These can be effective tools on most days when the market has\ntwo or three reversals lasting an hour or more. The problem comes when the market is trending strongly. If you focus too much on your indicators,\nyou will see that they are forming divergences all day long and you might find yourself repeatedly entering countertrend and losing money. By the\ntime you come to accept that the market is trending, you will not have enough time left in the day to recoup your losses. Instead, if you were simply\nlooking at a bar or candle chart, you would see that the market is clearly trending and you would not be tempted by indicators to look for trend\nreversals.

Placing a trade because of a divergence in the absence of a\nprior countertrend momentum surge that breaks a trend line is a losing strategy. Wait for the trend line break and then see if the test of the old\nextreme reverses or if the old trend resumes. You do not need an indicator to tell you that a strong reversal here is a high-probability trade, at least\nfor a scalp, and there will almost certainly be a divergence, so why complicate your thinking by adding the indicator to your calculus?\nSome pundits recommend a combination of time frames, indicators, wave counting, and Fibonacci retracements and extensions, but when it\ncomes time to place the trade, they will do it only if there is a good price action setup. Also, when they see a good price action setup, they start\nlooking for indicators that show divergences, different time frames for moving average tests, wave counts, or Fibonacci setups to confirm what is in\nfront of them. In reality, they are price action traders who are trading exclusively off price action on only one chart but don’t feel comfortable\nadmitting it. They are complicating their trading to the point that they certainly are missing many, many trades because their overanalysis takes too\nmuch time for them to place their orders and they are forced to wait for the next setup. The logic just isn’t there for making the simple so\ncomplicated. Obviously, adding any information can lead to better decision making and many people might be able to process lots of inputs when\ndeciding whether to place a trade. Ignoring data because of a simplistic ideology alone is foolish. The goal is to make money, and traders should\ndo everything they can to maximize their profits. I simply cannot process multiple indicators and time frames well in the time needed to place my\norders accurately, and I find that carefully reading a single chart is far more profitable for me. Also, if I rely on indicators, I find that I get lazy in my\nprice action reading and often miss the obvious. Price action is far more important than any other information, and if you sacrifice some of what it is\ntelling you to gain information from something else, you are likely making a bad decision.\nOne of the most frustrating things for traders when they are starting out is that everything is so subjective.

Almost every bar offers important clues as to where the market is going, and a trader who dismisses any activity as noise is passing up\nmany profitable trades each day. Most of the observations in these books are directly related to placing trades, but a few have to do with simple\ncurious price action tendencies without sufficient dependability to be the basis for a trade.\nI personally rely mainly on candle charts for my Emini, futures, and stock trading, but most signals are also visible on any type of chart and many\nare even evident on simple line charts. I focus primarily on 5 minute candle charts to illustrate basic principles but also discuss daily and weekly\ncharts as well. Since I also trade stocks, forex, Treasury note futures, and options, I discuss how price action can be used as the basis for this type\nof trading.\nAs a trader, I see everything in shades of gray and am constantly thinking in terms of probabilities. If a pattern is setting up and is not perfect but\nis reasonably similar to a reliable setup, it will likely behave similarly as well. Close is usually close enough. If something resembles a textbook\nsetup, the trade will likely unfold in a way that is similar to the trade from the textbook setup. This is the art of trading and it takes years to become\ngood at trading in the gray zone. Everyone wants concrete, clear rules or indicators, and chat rooms, newsletters, hotlines, or tutors that will tell them\nwhen exactly to get in to minimize risk and maximize profit, but none of it works in the long run. You have to take responsibility for your decisions,\nbut you first have to learn how to make them and that means that you have to get used to operating in the gray fog. Nothing is ever as clear as black\nand white, and I have been doing this long enough to appreciate that anything, no matter how unlikely, can and will happen. It’s like quantum\nphysics. Every conceivable event has a probability, and so do events that you have yet to consider. It is not emotional, and the reasons why\nsomething happens are irrelevant. Watching to see if the Federal Reserve cuts rates today is a waste of time because there is both a bullish and\nbearish interpretation of anything that the Fed does. What is key is to see what the market does, not what the Fed does.\nIf you think about it, trading is a zero-sum game and it is impossible to have a zero-sum game where rules consistently work. If they worked,\neveryone would use them and then there would be no one on the other side of the trade. Therefore, the trade could not exist. Guidelines are very\nhelpful but reliable rules cannot exist, and this is usually very troubling to a trader starting out who wants to believe that trading is a game that can be\nvery profitable if only you can come up with just the right set of rules. All rules work some of the time, and usually just often enough to fool you into\nbelieving that you just need to tweak them a little to get them to work all of the time. You are trying to create a trading god who will protect you, but\nyou are fooling yourself and looking for an easy solution to a game where only hard solutions work. You are competing against the smartest people\nin the world, and if you are smart enough to come up with a foolproof rule set, so are they, and then everyone is faced with the zero-sum game\ndilemma. You cannot make money trading unless you are flexible, because you need to go where the market is going, and the market is extremely\nflexible. It can bend in every direction and for much longer than most would ever imagine. It can also reverse repeatedly every few bars for a long,\nlong time. Finally, it can and will do everything in between. Never get upset by this, and just accept it as reality and admire it as part of the beauty of\nthe game.\nThe market gravitates toward uncertainty. During most of the day, every market has a directional probability of 50–50 of an equidistant move up\nor down. By that I mean that if you don’t even look at a chart and you buy any stock and then place a one cancels the other (OCO) order to exit on a\nprofit-taking limit order X cents above your entry or on a protective stop at X cents below your entry, you have about a 50 percent chance of being\nright. Likewise, if you sell any stock at any point in the day without looking at a chart and then place a profit-taking limit order X cents lower and a\nprotective stop X cents higher, you have about a 50 percent chance of winning and about a 50 percent chance of losing. There is the obvious\nexception of X being too large relative the price of the stock. You can’t have X be $60 in a $50 stock, because you would have a 0 percent chance\nof losing $60. You also can’t have X be $49, because the odds of losing $49 would also be minuscule. But if you pick a value for X that is within\nreasonable reach on your time frame, this is generally true. When the market is 50–50, it is uncertain and you cannot rationally have an opinion\nabout its direction. This is the hallmark of a trading range, so whenever you are uncertain, assume that the market is in a trading range. There are\nbrief times on a chart when the directional probability is higher. During a strong trend, it might be 60 or even 70 percent, but that cannot last long\nbecause it will gravitate toward uncertainty and a 50–50 market where both the bulls and bears feel there is value. When there is a trend and some\nlevel of directional certainty, the market will also gravitate toward areas of support and resistance, which are usually some type of measured move\naway, and those areas are invariably where uncertainty returns and a trading range develops, at least briefly.\nNever watch the news during the trading day. If you want to know what a news event means, the chart in front of you will tell you. Reporters believe\nthat the news is the most important thing in the world, and that everything that happens has to be caused by their biggest news story of the day.\nSince reporters are in the news business, news must be the center of the universe and the cause of everything that happens in the financial\nmarkets. When the stock market sold off in mid-March 2011, they attributed it to the earthquake in Japan. It did not matter to them that the market\nbegan to sell off three weeks earlier, after a buy climax. I told the members of my chat room in late February that the odds were good that the\nmarket was going to have a significant correction when I saw 15 consecutive bull trend bars on the daily chart after a protracted bull run. This was\nan unusually strong buy climax, and an important statement by the market. I had no idea that an earthquake was going to happen in a few weeks,\nand did not need to know that, anyway. The chart was telling me what traders were doing; they were getting ready to exit their longs and initiate\nshorts.\nTelevision experts are also useless. Invariably when the market makes a huge move, the reporter will find some confident, convincing expert who\npredicted it and interview him or her, leading the viewers to believe that this pundit has an uncanny ability to predict the market, despite the untold\nreality that this same pundit has been wrong in his last 10 predictions. The pundit then makes some future prediction and naïve viewers will attach\nsignificance to it and let it affect their trading. What the viewers may not realize is that some pundits are bullish 100 percent of the time and others\nare bearish 100 percent of the time, and still others just swing for the fences all the time and make outrageous predictions. The reporter just rushes\nto the one who is consistent with the day’s news, which is totally useless to traders and in fact it is destructive because it can influence their trading\nand make them question and deviate from their own methods. No one is ever consistently right more than 60 percent of the time on these major\npredictions, and just because pundits are convincing does not make them reliable. There are equally smart and convincing people who believe the\nopposite but are not being heard. This is the same as watching a trial and listening to only the defense side of the argument. Hearing only one side\nis always convincing and always misleading, and rarely better than 50 percent reliable.\nInstitutional bulls and bears are placing trades all the time, and that is why there is constant uncertainty about the direction of the market. Even in\nthe absence of breaking news, the business channels air interviews all day long and each reporter gets to pick one pundit for her report. What you\nhave to realize is that she has a 50–50 chance of picking the right one in terms of the market’s direction over the next hour or so. If you decide to\nrely on the pundit to make a trading decision and he says that the market will sell off after midday and instead it just keeps going up, are you going\nto look to short? Should you believe this very convincing head trader at one of Wall Street’s top firms? He obviously is making over a million dollars\na year and they would not pay him that much unless he was able to correctly and consistently predict the market’s direction. In fact, he probably can\nand he is probably a good stock picker, but he almost certainly is not a day trader.

Almost every bar offers important clues as to where the market is going, and a trader who dismisses any activity as noise is passing up many profitable trades each day. Most of the observations in these books are directly related to placing trades, but a few have to do with simple curious price action tendencies without sufficient dependability to be the basis for a trade.\nI personally rely mainly on candle charts for my Emini, futures, and stock trading, but most signals are also visible on any type of chart and many are even evident on simple line charts. I focus primarily on 5 minute candle charts to illustrate basic principles but also discuss daily and weekly charts as well. Since I also trade stocks, forex, Treasury note futures, and options, I discuss how price action can be used as the basis for this type of trading.\nAs a trader, I see everything in shades of gray and am constantly thinking in terms of probabilities. If a pattern is setting up and is not perfect but is reasonably similar to a reliable setup, it will likely behave similarly as well. Close is usually close enough. If something resembles a textbook setup, the trade will likely unfold in a way that is similar to the trade from the textbook setup. This is the art of trading and it takes years to become good at trading in the gray zone. Everyone wants concrete, clear rules or indicators, and chat rooms, newsletters, hotlines, or tutors that will tell them when exactly to get in to minimize risk and maximize profit, but none of it works in the long run. You have to take responsibility for your decisions, but you first have to learn how to make them and that means that you have to get used to operating in the gray fog.

Every conceivable event has a probability, and so do events that you have yet to consider. It is not emotional, and the reasons why something happens are irrelevant. Watching to see if the Federal Reserve cuts rates today is a waste of time because there is both a bullish and bearish interpretation of anything that the Fed does. What is key is to see what the market does, not what the Fed does.\nIf you think about it, trading is a zero-sum game and it is impossible to have a zero-sum game where rules consistently work. If they worked, everyone would use them and then there would be no one on the other side of the trade. Therefore, the trade could not exist. Guidelines are very helpful but reliable rules cannot exist, and this is usually very troubling to a trader starting out who wants to believe that trading is a game that can be very profitable if only you can come up with just the right set of rules. All rules work some of the time, and usually just often enough to fool you into believing that you just need to tweak them a little to get them to work all of the time. You are trying to create a trading god who will protect you, but you are fooling yourself and looking for an easy solution to a game where only hard solutions work. You are competing against the smartest people in the world, and if you are smart enough to come up with a foolproof rule set, so are they, and then everyone is faced with the zero-sum game dilemma. You cannot make money trading unless you are flexible, because you need to go where the market is going, and the market is extremely flexible.

That means that they have to have\ninteresting guests, including some who will make outrageous predictions, others who are professorial and reassuring, and some who are just\nphysically attractive; most of them have to have some entertainment value. Although some guests are great traders, they cannot help you. For\nexample, if they interview one of the world’s most successful bond traders, he will usually only speak in general terms about the trend over the next\nseveral months, and he will do so only weeks after he has already placed his trades. If you are a day trader, this does not help you, because every\nbull or bear market on the monthly chart has just about as many up moves on the intraday chart as down moves, and there will be long and short\ntrades every day. His time frame is very different from yours, and his trading has nothing to do with what you are doing. They will also often interview\na chartist from a major Wall Street firm, who, while his credentials are good, will be basing his opinion on a weekly chart, but the viewers are\nlooking to take profits within a few days. To the chartist, that bull trend that he is recommending buying will still be intact, even if the market falls 10\npercent over the next couple of months. The viewers, however, will take their losses long before that, and will never benefit from the new high that\ncomes three months later. Unless the chartist is addressing your specific goals and time frame, whatever he says is useless. When television\ninterviews a day trader instead, he will talk about the trades that he already took, and the information is too late to help you make money. By the\ntime he is on television, the market might already be going in the opposite direction. If he is talking while still in his day trade, he will continue to\nmanage his trade long after his two-minute interview is over, and he will not manage it while on the air. Even if you enter the trade that he is in, he\nwill not be there when you invariably will have to make an important decision about getting out as the market turns against you, or as the market\ngoes in your direction and you are thinking about taking profits. Watching television for trading advice under any circumstances, even after a very\nimportant report, is a sure way to lose money and you should never do it.\nOnly look at the chart and it will tell you what you need to know.

Your friend is just trying to create a panic to drive\nthe market down so he can load up through a surrogate at a much better price.\nFriends and colleagues freely offer opinions for you to ignore. Occasionally traders will tell me that they have a great setup and want to discuss it\nwith me. I invariably get them angry with me when I tell them that I am not interested. They immediately perceive me as selfish, stubborn, and close-\nminded, and when it comes to trading, I am all of that and probably much more. The skills that make you money are generally seen as flaws to the\nlayperson. Why do I no longer read books or articles about trading, or talk to other traders about their ideas? As I said, the chart tells me all that I\nneed to know and any other information is a distraction. Several people have been offended by my attitude, but I think in part it comes from me\nturning down what they are presenting as something helpful to me when in reality they are making an offering, hoping that I will reciprocate with\nsome tutoring. They become frustrated and angry when I tell them that I don’t want to hear about anyone else’s trading techniques. I tell them that I\nhaven’t even mastered my own and probably never will, but I am confident that I will make far more money perfecting what I already know than trying\nto incorporate non-price-action approaches into my trading. I ask them if James Galway offered a beautiful flute to Yo-Yo Ma and insisted that Ma\nstart learning to play the flute because Galway makes so much money by playing his flute, should Ma accept the offer? Clearly not. Ma should\ncontinue to play the cello and by doing so he will make far more money than if he also started playing the flute. I am no Galway or Ma, but the\nconcept is the same. Price action is the only instrument that I want to play, and I strongly believe that I will make far more money by mastering it than\nby incorporating ideas from other successful traders.\nThe charts, not the experts on television, will tell you exactly how the institutions are interpreting the news.\nYesterday, Costco’s earnings were up 32 percent on the quarter and above analysts’ expectations (see Figure I.2). COST gapped up on the\nopen, tested the gap on the first bar, and then ran up over a dollar in 20 minutes. It then drifted down to test yesterday’s close. It had two rallies that\nbroke bear trend lines, and both failed. This created a double top (bars 2 and 3) bear flag or triple top (bars 1, 2, and 3), and the market then\nplunged $3, below the prior day’s low. If you were unaware of the report, you would have shorted at the failed bear trend line breaks at bars 2 and 3\nand you would have sold more below bar 4, which was a pullback that followed the breakout below yesterday’s low. You would have reversed to\nlong on the bar 5 big reversal bar, which was the second attempt to reverse the breakout below yesterday’s low and a climactic reversal of the\nbreakout of the bottom of the steep bear trend channel line.\nFIGURE I.2 Ignore the News\n", "text_clean": "making 1 percent two or three times a day and maybe 1,000 percent a year.

Several people have been offended by my attitude, but I think in part it comes from me turning down what they are presenting as something helpful to me when in reality they are making an offering, hoping that I will reciprocate with some tutoring. They become frustrated and angry when I tell them that I don’t want to hear about anyone else’s trading techniques. I tell them that I haven’t even mastered my own and probably never will, but I am confident that I will make far more money perfecting what I already know than trying to incorporate non-price-action approaches into my trading. I ask them if James Galway offered a beautiful flute to Yo-Yo Ma and insisted that Ma start learning to play the flute because Galway makes so much money by playing his flute, should Ma accept the offer? Clearly not. Ma should continue to play the cello and by doing so he will make far more money than if he also started playing the flute. I am no Galway or Ma, but the concept is the same. Price action is the only instrument that I want to play, and I strongly believe that I will make far more money by mastering it than by incorporating ideas from other successful traders.\nThe charts, not the experts on television, will tell you exactly how the institutions are interpreting the news.\nYesterday, Costco’s earnings were up 32 percent on the quarter and above analysts’ expectations (see Figure I.2). COST gapped up on the open, tested the gap on the first bar, and then ran up over a dollar in 20 minutes. It then drifted down to test yesterday’s close. It had two rallies that broke bear trend lines, and both failed. This created a double top (bars 2 and 3) bear flag or triple top (bars 1, 2, and 3), and the market then plunged $3, below the prior day’s low. If you were unaware of the report, you would have shorted at the failed bear trend line breaks at bars 2 and 3 and you would have sold more below bar 4, which was a pullback that followed the breakout below yesterday’s low. You would have reversed to long on the bar 5 big reversal bar, which was the second attempt to reverse the breakout below yesterday’s low and a climactic reversal of the breakout of the bottom of the steep bear trend channel line.\nFIGURE I.2 Ignore the News", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["making 1 percent two or three times a day and maybe 1,000 percent a year.

In particular, they want to know when the remaining cards in the deck are likely overweighed with face cards.

Trading range traders are looking for times when they think the market has gone too far in one direction and then\nthey place a trade in the opposite direction (a fade).\nI tried playing poker online a few times without using real money to find similarities to and differences from trading. I discovered early on that\nthere was a deal breaker for me: I was constantly anxious because of the inherent unfairness due to luck, and I never want luck to be a large\ncomponent of the odds for my success. This is a huge difference and makes me see gambling and trading as fundamentally different, despite\npublic perception. In trading, everyone is dealt the same cards so the game is always fair and, over time, you get rewarded or penalized entirely\ndue to your skill as a trader. Obviously, sometimes you can trade correctly and lose, and this can happen several times in a row due to the\nprobability curve of all possible outcomes. There is a real but microscopic chance that you can trade well and lose 10 or even 100 times or more in\na row; but I cannot remember the last time I saw as many as four good signals fail in a row, so this is a chance that I am willing to take. If you trade\nwell, over time you should make money because it is a zero-sum game (except for commissions, which should be small if you choose an\nappropriate broker). If you are better than most of the other traders, you will win their money.\nThere are two types of gambling that are different from pure games of chance, and both are similar to trading. In both sports betting and poker,\ngamblers are trying to take money from other gamblers rather than from the house, and therefore they can create odds in their favor if they are\nsignificantly better than their competitors. However, the “commissions” that they pay can be far greater than those that a trader pays, especially with\nsports betting, where the vig is usually 10 percent, and that is why incredibly successful sports gamblers like Billy Walters are so rare: they have to\nbe at least 10 percent better than the competition just to break even. Successful poker players are more common, as can be seen on all of the\npoker shows on TV. However, even the best poker players do not make anything comparable to what the best traders make, because the practical\nlimits to their trading size are much smaller.\nI personally find trading not to be stressful, because the luck factor is so tiny that it is not worth considering. However, there is one thing that\ntrading and playing poker share, and that is the value of patience. In poker, you stand to make far more money if you patiently wait to bet on only the\nvery best hands, and traders make more when they have the patience to wait for the very best setups. For me, this protracted downtime is much\neasier in trading because I can see all of the other “cards” during the slow times, and it is intellectually stimulating to look for subtle price action\nphenomena.\nThere is an important adage in gambling that is true in all endeavors, and that is that you should not bet until you have a good hand. In trading,\nthat is true as well. Wait for a good setup before placing a trade. If you trade without discipline and without a sound method, then you are relying on\nluck and hope for your profits, and your trading is unquestionably a form of gambling.\nOne unfortunate comparison is from nontraders who assume that all day traders, and all market traders for that matter, are addicted gamblers\nand therefore have a mental illness. I suspect that many are addicted, in the sense that they are doing it more for excitement than for profit. They are\nwilling to make low-probability bets and lose large sums of money because of the huge rush they feel when they occasionally win. However, most\nsuccessful traders are essentially investors, just like an investor who buys commercial real estate or a small business. The only real differences\nfrom any other type of investing are that the time frame is shorter and the leverage is greater.\nUnfortunately, it is common for beginners to occasionally gamble, and it invariably costs them money. Every successful trader trades on the basis\nof rules. Whenever traders deviate from those rules for any reason, they are trading on hope rather than logic and are then gambling. Beginning\ntraders often find themselves gambling right after having a couple of losses. They are eager to be made whole again and are willing to take some\nchances to make that happen. They will take trades that they normally would not take, because they are eager to get back the money they just lost.\nSince they are now taking a trade that they believe is a low-probability trade and they are taking it because of anxiety and sadness over their\nlosses, they are now gambling and not trading. After they lose on their gamble, they feel even worse. Not only are they even further down on the day,\nbut they feel especially sad because they are faced with the reality that they did not have the discipline to stick to their system when they know that\ndiscipline is one of the critical ingredients to success.\nInterestingly, neurofinance researchers have found that brain scan images of traders about to make a trade are indistinguishable from those of\ndrug addicts about to take a hit. They found a snowball effect and an increased desire to continue, regardless of the outcome of their behavior.\nUnfortunately, when faced with losses, traders assume more risk rather than less, often leading to the death of their accounts. Without knowing the\nneuroscience, Warren Buffett clearly understood the problem, as seen in his statement, “Once you have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the\ntemperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing.” The great traders control their emotions and constantly follow their\nrules.\nOne final point about gambling: There is a natural tendency to assume that nothing can last forever and that every behavior regresses toward a\nmean. If the market has three or four losing trades, surely the odds favor the next one being a winner. It’s just like flipping a coin, isn’t it?\nUnfortunately, that is not how markets behave. When a market is trending, most attempts to reverse fail. When it is in a trading range, most\nattempts to break out fail. This is the opposite of coin flips, where the odds are always 50–50. In trading, the odds are more like 70 percent or\nbetter that what just happened will continue to happen again and again. Because of the coin flip logic, most traders at some point begin to consider\ngame theory.\nMartingale techniques work well in theory but not in practice because of the conflict between math and emotion. That is the martingale paradox. If\nyou double (or even triple) your position size and reverse at each loss, you will theoretically make money. Although four losers in a row is\nuncommon on the 5 minute Emini chart if you choose your trades carefully, they will happen, and so will a dozen or more, even though I can’t\nremember ever seeing that. In any case, if you are comfortable trading 10 contracts, but start with just one and plan to double up and reverse with\neach loss, four consecutive losers would require 16 contracts on your next trade and eight consecutive losers would require 256 contracts! It is\nunlikely that you would place a trade that is larger than your comfort zone following four or more losers. Anyone willing to trade one contract initially\nwould never be willing to trade 16 or 256 contracts, and anyone willing to trade 256 contracts would never be willing to initiate this strategy with just\none. This is the inherent, insurmountable, mathematical problem with this approach.\nSince trading is fun and competitive, it is natural for people to compare it to games, and because wagering is involved, gambling is usually the\n", "text_clean": "definition to situations where the odds are slightly against you and you will lose over time.

Beginning traders often find themselves gambling right after having a couple of losses. They are eager to be made whole again and are willing to take some chances to make that happen. They will take trades that they normally would not take, because they are eager to get back the money they just lost.\nSince they are now taking a trade that they believe is a low-probability trade and they are taking it because of anxiety and sadness over their losses, they are now gambling and not trading. After they lose on their gamble, they feel even worse. Not only are they even further down on the day, but they feel especially sad because they are faced with the reality that they did not have the discipline to stick to their system when they know that discipline is one of the critical ingredients to success.\nInterestingly, neurofinance researchers have found that brain scan images of traders about to make a trade are indistinguishable from those of drug addicts about to take a hit. They found a snowball effect and an increased desire to continue, regardless of the outcome of their behavior.\nUnfortunately, when faced with losses, traders assume more risk rather than less, often leading to the death of their accounts. Without knowing the neuroscience, Warren Buffett clearly understood the problem, as seen in his statement, “Once you have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing.” The great traders control their emotions and constantly follow their rules.\nOne final point about gambling: There is a natural tendency to assume that nothing can last forever and that every behavior regresses toward a mean. If the market has three or four losing trades, surely the odds favor the next one being a winner. It’s just like flipping a coin, isn’t it?\nUnfortunately, that is not how markets behave. When a market is trending, most attempts to reverse fail. When it is in a trading range, most attempts to break out fail. This is the opposite of coin flips, where the odds are always 50–50. In trading, the odds are more like 70 percent or better that what just happened will continue to happen again and again. Because of the coin flip logic, most traders at some point begin to consider game theory.\nMartingale techniques work well in theory but not in practice because of the conflict between math and emotion. That is the martingale paradox. If you double (or even triple) your position size and reverse at each loss, you will theoretically make money. Although four losers in a row is uncommon on the 5 minute Emini chart if you choose your trades carefully, they will happen, and so will a dozen or more, even though I can’t remember ever seeing that. In any case, if you are comfortable trading 10 contracts, but start with just one and plan to double up and reverse with each loss, four consecutive losers would require 16 contracts on your next trade and eight consecutive losers would require 256 contracts! It is unlikely that you would place a trade that is larger than your comfort zone following four or more losers. Anyone willing to trade one contract initially would never be willing to trade 16 or 256 contracts, and anyone willing to trade 256 contracts would never be willing to initiate this strategy with just one. This is the inherent, insurmountable, mathematical problem with this approach.\nSince trading is fun and competitive, it is natural for people to compare it to games, and because wagering is involved, gambling is usually the", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["definition to situations where the odds are slightly against you and you will lose over time.

For example, when there is a bull channel and a large bear bar forms, this breakout\nbar has a low and close that are below the lows and closes of five or even 20 or more bars. A large number of bars reversed by the\nclose of the bear bar is a stronger sign than a similar number of bars reversed by only its low.\nBAR COUNTING BASICS: HIGH 1, HIGH 2, LOW 1, LOW 2\nA reliable sign that a pullback in a bull trend or in a trading range has ended is when the current bar’s high extends at least one tick above the high\nof the prior bar. This leads to a useful concept of counting the number of times that this occurs, which is called bar counting. In a sideways or\ndownward move in a bull trend or a trading range, the first bar whose high is above the high of the prior bar is a high 1, and this ends the first leg of\nthe sideways or down move, although this leg may become a small leg in a larger pullback.

Remember,\nevery trend bar is a breakout, and there are buyers and sellers at the top and bottom of every bull and bear trend bar, no matter how strong the bar\nappears. A breakout of anything is the same. There are traders placing trades based on the belief that the breakout will succeed, and other traders\nplacing trades in the opposite direction, betting it will fail and the market will reverse. A reversal after a single bar on the 15 minute chart is probably\na reversal that took place over many bars on the 1 minute chart, and a reversal that took place over 10 to 20 bars can be a one-bar reversal on a\n120 minute chart. The process is the same on all time frames, whether it takes place after a single bar or many bars. If traders develop the skill to\nknow which direction the market will likely go after a breakout attempt develops, they have an edge and will place their trades in that direction.\nReversal setups are common because every trend bar is a breakout and is soon followed by an attempt to make the breakout fail and reverse,\nas discussed in Chapter 5 of book 2. If the breakout looks stronger than the reversal attempt, the reversal attempt will usually not succeed, and the\nattempt to reverse will become the start of a flag in the new trend. For example, if there is a bull breakout of a trading range and the bull spike is\nmade of two large bull trend bars with small tails, and the next bar is a bear doji bar, that bear bar is an attempt to have the breakout fail and\nreverse back down into a bear trend. Since the breakout is much stronger than the reversal attempt, it is more likely that there are more buyers than\nsellers below the bear bar, and that the entry bar for the short will become a breakout pullback buy signal bar. In other words, instead of the reversal\nsucceeding, it is more likely that it will become the start of a bull flag and be followed by another leg up. If the reversal setup looks much stronger\nthan the breakout, it is more likely that the breakout will fail and that the market will reverse. Chapter 2 in book 2 discusses how to gauge the\nstrength of a breakout. In short, the more signs of strength that are present, the more likely that the breakout will succeed and that the reversal\nattempt will fail and lead to a breakout pullback setup.\nInstitutional trading is done by discretionary traders and computers, and computer program trading has become increasingly important.\nInstitutions base their trading on fundamental or technical information, or a combination of both, and both types of trading are done by traders and\nby computers. In general, most of the discretionary traders base their decisions primarily on fundamental information, and most of the computer\ntrades are based on technical data. Since the majority of the volume is now traded by HFT firms, and most of the trades are based on price action\nand other technical data, most of the program trading is technically based. In the late twentieth century, a single institution running a large program\ncould move the market, and the program would create a micro channel, which traders saw as a sign that a program was running. Now, most days\nhave a dozen or so micro channels in the Emini, and many have over 100,000 contracts traded. With the Emini currently around 1200, that\ncorresponds to $6 billion, and is larger than a single institution would trade for a single small trade. This means that a single institution cannot move\nthe market very far or for very long, and that all movement on the chart is caused by many institutions trading in the same direction at the same time.\nAlso, HFT computers analyze every tick and are constantly placing trades all day long. When they detect a program, many will scalp in the direction\nof the program, and they will often account for most of the volume while the micro channel (program) is progressing.\nThe institutions that are trading largely on technical information cannot move the market in one direction forever because at some point the\nmarket will appear as offering value to the institutions trading on fundamentals. If the technical institutions run the price up too high, fundamental\ninstitutions and other technical institutions will see the market as being at a great price to sell out of longs and to initiate shorts, and they will\noverwhelm the bullish technical trading and drive the market down. When the technical trading creates a bear trend, the market at some point will\nbe clearly cheap in the eyes of fundamental and other technical institutions. The buyers will come in and overwhelm the technical institutions\nresponsible for the sell-off and reverse the market up. Trend reversals on all time frames always happen at support and resistance levels, because\ntechnical traders and programs look for them as areas where they should stop pressing their bets and begin to take profits, and many will also\nbegin to trade in the opposite direction. Since they are all based on mathematics, computer algorithms, which generate 70 percent of all trading\nvolume and 80 percent of institutional volume, know where they are. Also, institutional fundamental traders pay attention to obvious technical\nfactors. They see major support and resistance on the chart as areas of value and will enter trades in the opposite direction when the market gets\nthere. The programs that trade on value will usually find it around the same areas, because there is almost always significant value by any measure\naround major support and resistance. Most of the programs make decisions based on price, and there are no secrets. When there is an important\nprice, they all see it, no matter what logic they use. The fundamental traders (people and machines) wait for value and commit heavily when they\ndetect it. They want to buy when they think that the market is cheap and sell when they believe it is expensive. For example, if the market is falling,\nbut it’s getting to a price level where the institutions feel like it is getting cheap, they will appear out of nowhere and buy aggressively. This is seen\nmost dramatically and often during opening reversals (the reversals can be up or down and are discussed in the section on trading the open later in\nthis book). The bears will buy back their shorts to take profits and the bulls will buy to establish new longs. No one is good at knowing when the\nmarket has gone far enough, but most experienced traders and programs are usually fairly confident in their ability to know when it has gone too far.\nBecause the institutions are waiting to buy until the market has become clearly oversold, there is an absence of buyers in the area above a\npossible bottom, and the market is able to accelerate down to the area where they are confident that it is cheap. Some institutions rely on programs\nto determine when to buy and others are discretionary. Once enough of them buy, the market will usually turn up for at least a couple of legs and\nabout 10 or more bars on whatever time frame chart where this is happening. While it is falling, institutions continue to short all the way down until\nthey determine that it has reached a likely target and it is unlikely to fall any further, at which point they take profits. The more oversold the market\nbecomes, the more of the selling volume is technically based, because fundamental traders and programs will not continue to short when they think\nthat the market is cheap and should soon be bought. The relative absence of buyers as the market gets close to a major support level often leads to\nan acceleration of the selling into the support, usually resulting in a sell vacuum that sucks the market below the support in a climactic sell-off, at\nwhich point the market reverses up sharply. Most support levels will not stop a bear trend (and most resistance levels will not stop a bull trend), but\nwhen the market finally reverses up, it will be at an obvious major support level, like a long-term trend line. The bottom of the sell-off and the reversal\nup is usually on very heavy volume. As the market is falling, it has many rallies up to resistance levels and sell-offs down to support levels along the\nway, and each reversal takes place when enough institutions determine that it has gone too far and is offering value for a trade in the opposite\ndirection. When enough institutions act around the same level, a major reversal takes place.\nThere are fundamental and technical ways to determine support. For example, it can be estimated with calculations, like what the S&P 500 price\nearnings multiple should theoretically be, but these calculations are never sufficiently precise for enough institutions to agree. However, traditional\nareas of support and resistance are easier to see and therefore more likely to be noticed by many institutions, and they more clearly define where\n", "text_clean": "PART I\nTrend Reversals: A Trend Becoming an Opposite Trend One of the most important skills that a trader can acquire is the ability to reliably determine when a breakout will succeed or reverse.

{"book": "REVERSAL", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\reversal3.pdf", "page_index": 29, "text_raw": "the market should reverse. In both the crashes of 1987 and 2008–2009, the market collapsed down to slightly below the monthly trend line and then\nreversed up, creating a major bottom. The market will continue up, with many tests down, until it has gone too far, which is always at a significant\nresistance level. Only then can the institutions be confident that there is clear value in selling out of longs and selling into shorts. The process then\nreverses down.\nThe fundamentals (the value in buying or selling) determine the overall direction, but the technicals determine the actual turning points. The\nmarket is always probing for value, which is an excess, and is always at support and resistance levels. Reports and news items at any time can\nalter the fundamentals (the perception of value) enough to make the market trend up or down for minutes to several days. Major reversals lasting for\nmonths are based on fundamentals and begin and end at support and resistance levels. This is true of every market and every time frame.\nIt is important to realize that the news will report the fundamentals as still bullish after the market has begun to turn down from a major top, and still\nbearish after it has turned up from a major bottom. Just because the news still sees the market as bullish or bearish does not mean that the\ninstitutions still do. Trade the charts and not the news. Price is truth and the market always leads the news. In fact, the news is always the most\nbullish at market tops and most bearish at market bottoms. The reporters get caught up in the euphoria or despair and search for pundits who will\nexplain why the trend is so strong and will continue much longer. They will ignore the smartest traders, and probably do not even know who they are.\nThose traders are interested in making money, not news, and will not seek out the reporters. When a reporter takes a cab to work and the driver\ntells him that he just sold all of his stocks and mortgaged his house so that he could buy gold, the reporter gets excited and can’t wait to find a\nbullish pundit to put on the air to confirm the reporter’s profound insight in the gold bull market. “Just think, the market is so strong that even my\ncabbie is buying gold! Everyone will therefore sell all of their other assets and buy more, and the market will have to race higher for many more\nmonths!” To me, when even the weakest traders finally enter the market, there is no one left to buy. The market needs a greater fool who is willing to\nbuy higher so that you can sell out with a profit. When there is no one left, the market can only go one way, and it is the opposite of what the news is\ntelling you. It is difficult to resist the endless parade of persuasive professorial pundits on television who are giving erudite arguments about how\ngold cannot go down and in fact will double again over the next year. However, you have to realize that they are there for their own self-\naggrandizement and for entertainment. The network needs the entertainment to attract viewers and advertising dollars. If you want to know what the\ninstitutions are really doing, just look at the charts. The institutions are too big to hide and if you understand how to read charts, you will see what\nthey are doing and where the market is heading, and it is usually unrelated to anything that you see on television.\nA successful trend reversal is a change from a bull market to a bear market or from a bear market to a bull market, and the single most important\nthing to remember is that most trend reversal attempts fail. A market has inertia, which means that it has a strong propensity to continue what it has\nbeen doing and a strong resistance to change. The result is that there is really no such thing as a trend reversal pattern. When there is a trend, all\npatterns are continuation patterns, but occasionally one will fail. Most technicians will label that failure as a reversal pattern, but since most of the\ntime it fails as a reversal and the trend continues, it is really more accurately thought of as just a continuation pattern. A trend is like a huge ship that\ntakes a lot of force applied over time to change its direction. There usually has to be some increase in two-sided trading before traders in the other\ndirection can take control, and that two-sided trading is a trading range. Because of this, most reversal patterns are trading ranges, but you should\nexpect the breakout from the trading range to be in the direction of the trend because that is what happens in about 80 percent of cases.\nSometimes the breakout will be in the opposite direction or the with-trend breakout will quickly fail and then reverse. When those events happen,\nmost traders will label the trading range as a reversal pattern, like a double top, a head and shoulders, or a final flag. All of the reversal patterns\nlisted in Part I can lead to a trend in the opposite direction, but they can also simply lead to a trading range, which is more likely to be followed by a\ntrend resumption. In this case, the reversal pattern is just a bull flag in a bull trend or a bear flag in a bear trend.\nWhen a trend reverses, the reversal can be sharp and immediate and have a lot of conviction early on, or it can happen slowly over the course of\na dozen or more bars. When it happens slowly, the market usually appears to be forming just another flag, but the pullback continues to grow until at\nsome point the with-trend traders give up and there is a breakout in the countertrend direction. For example, assume that there is a bear trend that\nis beginning to pull back and it forms a low 1 setup, but the market immediately turns up after the signal triggers. It then triggers a low 2 entry and\nthat, too, fails within a bar or so. At this point, assume that either the market breaks out of the top of the bear flag or it has one more push up,\ntriggering a wedge bear flag, the entry fails, and then the market has a breakout to the upside. A reversal at some point makes the majority of\ntraders believe that the always-in position has reversed, and this almost always requires some kind of breakout. This is discussed in detail in\nChapter 15, but it means that if you had to be in the market at all times, either long or short, the always-in position is whatever your current position\nis. The breakout characteristics are the same as with any breakout, and were discussed in the chapter on breakouts in Part I of book 2. At this\npoint, there is a new trend, and traders reverse their mind-set. When a bull trend reverses to a bear trend, they stop buying above bars on stops and\nbuying below bars on limit orders, and begin selling above bars on limit orders and selling below bars on stops. When a bear trend reverses to a\nbull trend, they stop selling below bars on stops and selling above bars on limit orders, and begin buying above bars on stops and buying below\nbars on limit orders. See Part III in the first book for more on trend behavior.\nEvery trend is contained within a channel, which is bordered by a trend line and a trend channel line, even though the channel may not be readily\napparent on a quick look at the chart. The single most important rule in these books is that you should never be thinking about trading against a\ntrend until after there has been a breakout of the channel, which means a break beyond a significant trend line. Also, you should take a reversal\ntrade only if there is a strong signal bar. You need evidence that the other side is strong enough to have a chance of taking control. And even then,\nyou should still be looking for with-trend trades because after this first countertrend surge, the market almost always goes back in the direction of\nthe trend to test the old trend extreme. Only rarely is the trend line break on such strong momentum that the test won’t be tradable for at least a\nscalp. If the market fails again around the price of the old extreme, then it has made two attempts to push through that level and failed, and\nwhenever the market tries twice to do something and fails, it usually tries the opposite. It is after this test of the old extreme that you should look for\ncountertrend swing trades and only if there is a good setup on the reversal away from the old extreme.\nIt is very important to distinguish a reversal trade from a countertrend scalp. A reversal trade is one where an always-in flip is likely. A\ncountertrend scalp is not a reversal trade; it usually has a bad trader’s equation and most often forms within a channel. Channels always look like\nthey are about to reverse, suckering traders into countertrend trades using stop entries. These traders soon get trapped and have to cover with a\nloss. For example, if there is a bull channel, it will usually have a reasonable-looking bear reversal or inside bar after the breakout to every new high.\nBeginners will see that there is enough room to the moving average for a short scalp and will short on a stop below the bar. They will lose money on\n70 percent or more of their countertrend scalps, and their average loser will be larger than their average winner. They take the shorts because they\nare eager to trade and most of the buy signals look weak, often forcing traders to buy within a few ticks of the top of the channel. The countertrend\nsetups often have good-looking signal bars, which convince traders that they can finesse a short scalp while waiting for a good-looking buy setup.\nThey see all of the prior bear reversal bars and pullbacks as signs of building selling pressure, and they are right. However, most short scalps will\nend up being just micro sell vacuums, where the market is getting sucked down to a support level, like around the bottom of the channel, or below a\n", "text_clean": "the market should reverse. In both the crashes of 1987 and 2008–2009, the market collapsed down to slightly below the monthly trend line and then reversed up, creating a major bottom. The market will continue up, with many tests down, until it has gone too far, which is always at a significant resistance level. Only then can the institutions be confident that there is clear value in selling out of longs and selling into shorts. The process then reverses down.\nThe fundamentals (the value in buying or selling) determine the overall direction, but the technicals determine the actual turning points. The market is always probing for value, which is an excess, and is always at support and resistance levels. Reports and news items at any time can alter the fundamentals (the perception of value) enough to make the market trend up or down for minutes to several days. Major reversals lasting for months are based on fundamentals and begin and end at support and resistance levels. This is true of every market and every time frame.\nIt is important to realize that the news will report the fundamentals as still bullish after the market has begun to turn down from a major top, and still bearish after it has turned up from a major bottom. Just because the news still sees the market as bullish or bearish does not mean that the institutions still do. Trade the charts and not the news. Price is truth and the market always leads the news. In fact, the news is always the most bullish at market tops and most bearish at market bottoms. The reporters get caught up in the euphoria or despair and search for pundits who will explain why the trend is so strong and will continue much longer. They will ignore the smartest traders, and probably do not even know who they are.\nThose traders are interested in making money, not news, and will not seek out the reporters. When a reporter takes a cab to work and the driver tells him that he just sold all of his stocks and mortgaged his house so that he could buy gold, the reporter gets excited and can’t wait to find a bullish pundit to put on the air to confirm the reporter’s profound insight in the gold bull market. “Just think, the market is so strong that even my cabbie is buying gold! Everyone will therefore sell all of their other assets and buy more, and the market will have to race higher for many more months!” To me, when even the weakest traders finally enter the market, there is no one left to buy. The market needs a greater fool who is willing to buy higher so that you can sell out with a profit. When there is no one left, the market can only go one way, and it is the opposite of what the news is telling you. It is difficult to resist the endless parade of persuasive professorial pundits on television who are giving erudite arguments about how gold cannot go down and in fact will double again over the next year. However, you have to realize that they are there for their own selfaggrandizement and for entertainment. The network needs the entertainment to attract viewers and advertising dollars. If you want to know what the institutions are really doing, just look at the charts. The institutions are too big to hide and if you understand how to read charts, you will see what they are doing and where the market is heading, and it is usually unrelated to anything that you see on television.\nA successful trend reversal is a change from a bull market to a bear market or from a bear market to a bull market, and the single most important thing to remember is that most trend reversal attempts fail.

Many take profits at the new high, creating the next sell signal, which will\nfail like all of the earlier ones. High-frequency trading firms pay minuscule commissions and can profitably trade for one or two ticks, but you cannot.\nAlthough there are good-looking reversal bars, these are not tradable reversals, and traders should not take them. As long as the signal is not good\nenough to flip the always-in direction to short, only trade in the direction of the trend. The institutions are buying below the lows of those sell signal\nbars. If you want to trade while the channel is forming, you either have to buy with limit orders below prior bars, like the institutions, or buy above\nhigh 2 signal bars, which is where the bears usually buy back their losing shorts. However, this is difficult for many traders, because they can see\nthat the channel has a lot of two-sided trading and know that buying at the top of a channel, where there is a lot of two-sided trading, is an approach\nthat often has only a marginally positive trader’s equation.\nA trend reversal, or simply a reversal, is not necessarily an actual trend reversal because the term implies that the market is changing from one\nbehavior to any opposite behavior. It is best thought of as a change from a bull trend to a bear trend or vice versa, and that is the subject of Part I.\nTrading range behavior is arguably the opposite of trending behavior, so if a trading range breaks out into a trend, that is a reversal of the behavior\nof the market, but it is more commonly described as a breakout. A pullback is a small trading range and a small trend against the larger trend, and\nwhen the pullback ends, that minor trend reverses back into the direction of the major trend. Most trend reversals end up as higher time frame\npullbacks in the trend, which means that most end up as large trading ranges; however, some become strong, persistent trends in the opposite\ndirection. Even when the reversal leads to a trading range, the reversal entry will usually go far enough to be a swing trade.\nMost trend reversal attempts do not result in a strong, opposite trend and instead lead to trading ranges. Strictly speaking, the behavior has\nreversed into an opposite type of price action (from one-sided trading to two-sided trading), but the trend has not reversed into an opposite trend. A\ntrader never knows in advance if there will be a reversal into a new trend, and a reversal into a trading range often looks the same as a reversal into\na new trend for dozens of bars. Because of this, a trader does not know until much later whether there has been a reversal into the opposite trend or\njust a transition into a trading range. This is why the probability of most trades, where the reward is many times greater than the risk, is so small at\nthe outset. As the moves becomes more certain, the reward gets smaller, because there are fewer ticks left to the move, and the risk gets larger\nbecause the theoretically ideal stop for a swing trade goes beyond the start of the most recent spike (below the most recent higher low in a bull or\nabove the most recent lower high in a bear, which can be far away). From a trader’s perspective, it does not matter because traders are going to\ntrade the reversal the same way, whether it evolves into a strong new trend or simply into a couple of large countertrend legs. Yes, they would make\nmore money from a huge swing that does not come back to their breakeven stops, but they can still make a lot of money if the market stalls and\nsimply becomes a large trading range. However, in a trading range, traders will usually make more money if they look for scalps rather than swings.\nTrading ranges and pullbacks were discussed in book 2. In a true trend reversal, the new trend can go a long way and traders should swing most of\ntheir position.\nIf the market does reverse into an opposite trend, the new trend may be either protracted or limited to a single bar. The market may also simply\ndrift sideways after a bar or two, and then trend again later, either up or down. Many technicians will not use the term reversal except in hindsight,\nafter a series of trending highs and lows has formed. However, this is not useful in trading because waiting for that to occur will result in a weaker\ntrader’s equation, since a significant pullback (a greater drawdown) in that new trend becomes more likely the longer the trend has been in effect.\nOnce a trader is initiating trades in the opposite direction to the trend, that trader believes that the trend has reversed even though the strict criteria\nhave not yet been met. For example, if traders are buying in a bear trend, they believe that the market will likely not trade even a single tick lower;\notherwise they would wait to buy. Since they are buying with the belief that the market will go higher, they believe the trend is now upward and\ntherefore a reversal has taken place, at least on a scale large enough for the trade to be profitable.\nMany technicians will not accept this definition, because it does not require some basic components of a trend to exist. Most would agree on two\nrequirements for a trend reversal. The first is an absolute requirement: the move has to break a trend line from the prior trend so that the old trend\nchannel has been broken. The second requirement happens most of the time, but is not required: after the trend line break, the market comes back\nand successfully tests the extreme of the old trend. Rarely, there can be a climactic reversal that has a protracted initial move and never comes\nclose to testing the old extreme.\nThe sequence is the same for any reversal. Every trend is in a channel and when there is a move that breaks the trend line, the market has\nbroken out of the channel. This breakout beyond the trend line is followed by a move back in the direction of the trend. The trend traders want this to\nbe a failed reversal attempt and for the old trend to resume. If they are right, the new trend channel will usually be broader and less steep, which\nindicates some loss of momentum. This is natural as a trend matures. They see this trend line break as simply leading to another flag that will be\nfollowed by an extension of the trend.\nThe countertrend traders want this reversal back in the direction of the old trend, after the breakout, to be a breakout test and then be followed by\nat least a second leg against the old trend. In a successful breakout, instead of resuming the trend, the test reverses once more and the test\nbecomes a breakout pullback in the new trend, or at least in a larger correction. For example, in the breakout above the bear trend line in a bear\ntrend, at some point the reversal will attempt to fail and then sell off to a lower low, a double bottom, or a higher low, which is the test of the bear low.\nIf that test is successful, that test becomes a breakout pullback in the breakout above the bear trend line and the new bull trend resumes for at least\none more leg. When the reversal up results in a reversal into a new trend, the rally that broke above the bear trend line is when the bulls began to\ntake control over the market, even if the pullback from this bull breakout falls to a lower low. Most traders will see the lower low as the start of the bull\ntrend, but the bulls often take control during the spike that breaks above the bear trend line. It does not matter if you say that the bull began at the\nbottom of the bull spike or at the bottom of the lower low reversal, because you trade the market the same. You look to buy as the market is\nreversing up from the lower low (or double bottom or higher low). The rally that follows could become a large two-legged correction, the start of a\ntrading range, or a new bull trend. No matter what the end result is, the bulls have a good chance of a profitable trade. If the test is unsuccessful, the\nmarket will continue down into a new bear leg and traders have to look for another breakout above the new bear channel and then another test of\nthe new bear low before looking to buy a bottom. The opposite is true when there is a bull trend that has a bear spike below the bull trend line, and\nthen a higher high, double top, or lower high pullback from the breakout. The bears began to take control over the market during the spike. The test\nof the bull high, even if it exceeds the old high, is still simply a pullback from the initial bear breakout below the bull trend line.\nOnce there has been a strong countertrend move, the pullback will be a test for both the bulls and the bears. For example, suppose there was a\nstrong downward move in a bull market, and the move broke through a trend line that had held for 20 to 40 bars; it then continued down for 20 bars\nand carried well below the 20-bar moving average, and even beneath the low of the last higher low of the bull trend; in this case the bears have\ndemonstrated considerable strength. Once this first leg down exhausts itself, bears will begin to take partial profits, and bulls will begin to reinstate\ntheir longs. Both will cause the market to move higher, and both bulls and bears will watch this move very carefully. Because the down leg was so\nstrong, both the bulls and the bears believe that its low will likely be tested before the market breaks out into a new high. Therefore, as the market\nrallies, if there is not strong momentum up, the new bulls will start to take profits and the bears will become aggressive and add to their shorts.

This breakout beyond the trend line is followed by a move back in the direction of the trend. The trend traders want this to be a failed reversal attempt and for the old trend to resume. If they are right, the new trend channel will usually be broader and less steep, which indicates some loss of momentum. This is natural as a trend matures. They see this trend line break as simply leading to another flag that will be followed by an extension of the trend.\nThe countertrend traders want this reversal back in the direction of the old trend, after the breakout, to be a breakout test and then be followed by at least a second leg against the old trend. In a successful breakout, instead of resuming the trend, the test reverses once more and the test becomes a breakout pullback in the new trend, or at least in a larger correction. For example, in the breakout above the bear trend line in a bear trend, at some point the reversal will attempt to fail and then sell off to a lower low, a double bottom, or a higher low, which is the test of the bear low.\nIf that test is successful, that test becomes a breakout pullback in the breakout above the bear trend line and the new bull trend resumes for at least one more leg. When the reversal up results in a reversal into a new trend, the rally that broke above the bear trend line is when the bulls began to take control over the market, even if the pullback from this bull breakout falls to a lower low. Most traders will see the lower low as the start of the bull trend, but the bulls often take control during the spike that breaks above the bear trend line. It does not matter if you say that the bull began at the bottom of the bull spike or at the bottom of the lower low reversal, because you trade the market the same. You look to buy as the market is reversing up from the lower low (or double bottom or higher low). The rally that follows could become a large two-legged correction, the start of a trading range, or a new bull trend. No matter what the end result is, the bulls have a good chance of a profitable trade. If the test is unsuccessful, the market will continue down into a new bear leg and traders have to look for another breakout above the new bear channel and then another test of the new bear low before looking to buy a bottom. The opposite is true when there is a bull trend that has a bear spike below the bull trend line, and then a higher high, double top, or lower high pullback from the breakout. The bears began to take control over the market during the spike. The test of the bull high, even if it exceeds the old high, is still simply a pullback from the initial bear breakout below the bull trend line.\nOnce there has been a strong countertrend move, the pullback will be a test for both the bulls and the bears. For example, suppose there was a strong downward move in a bull market, and the move broke through a trend line that had held for 20 to 40 bars; it then continued down for 20 bars and carried well below the 20-bar moving average, and even beneath the low of the last higher low of the bull trend; in this case the bears have demonstrated considerable strength. Once this first leg down exhausts itself, bears will begin to take partial profits, and bulls will begin to reinstate their longs. Both will cause the market to move higher, and both bulls and bears will watch this move very carefully. Because the down leg was so strong, both the bulls and the bears believe that its low will likely be tested before the market breaks out into a new high. Therefore, as the market rallies, if there is not strong momentum up, the new bulls will start to take profits and the bears will become aggressive and add to their shorts.

In any case, the odds are high that there will be a\nsecond leg down, since both the bulls and the bears expect it and will be trading accordingly.\nThere will still be bulls who bought much lower and want to give the bull trend every possible chance to resume. Traders know that most reversal\nattempts fail, and many who rode the trend up will not exit their longs until after the bears have demonstrated the ability to push the market down\nhard. Many longs bought puts to protect themselves in case of a severe reversal. The puts allow them to hold on to give the bull trend every possible\nchance to resume. They know that the puts limit their losses, no matter how far the market might fall, but once they see this impressive selling\npressure, they will then look for a rally to finally exit their longs, and will take profits on their puts as the market turns back up. Also, most of their puts\nexpire within a few months, and once expired, the traders no longer have downside protection. This means that they cannot continue to hold on to\ntheir positions unless they keep buying more and more puts. If they believe that the market will likely fall further and not rally again for many months,\nit does not make sense to continue to pay for ongoing put protection. Instead, they will look to sell out of their positions. Their supply will limit the\nrally, and their selling, added to the shorting by aggressive bears and the profit taking by bulls who saw the sell-off as a buying opportunity, will\ncreate a second leg down.\nThese persistent bulls will each have a price level on the downside that, if reached, will make them want to exit on the next rally. As the market\nkeeps working lower, more and more of these bulls will decide that the bull trend will not resume anytime soon and that the trend might have\nreversed into a bear trend. These remaining die-hard longs will wait patiently for a pullback in the bear swing to exit their longs, and their positions\nrepresent a supply that is overhanging the market. They sell below the most recent swing high because they doubt that the market will be able to get\nabove a prior swing high and are happy to get out at any price above the most recent low. Bears will also look for a pullback from each new low to\nadd to their shorts and place new shorts. The result is a series of lower highs and lower lows, which is the definition of a bear trend.\nTypically, the initial move will break the trend line and then form a pullback that tests the end of the old trend, and traders will look to initiate\ncountertrend (actually with-trend, in the direction of the new trend) positions after this test. Most traders will want the leg that breaks the trend line\nand the one that tests the trend’s extreme to have more than just two or three bars. Is five enough? What about 10? It all depends on context. A\ntrend line break that has just one or two exceptionally large bars can be enough to make traders expect at least a second leg. Is a two-bar pullback\nenough of a test of the old extreme? Most traders prefer to see at least five bars or so, but sometimes the trend line break or the pullback can be\nonly two or three bars long and still convince traders that the trend has reversed. If one of the two legs is just a couple of bars, most traders will not\ntrade the new trend aggressively unless the other leg has more bars. Because of this, the new trend will rarely begin after just a two-bar trend line\nbreak and then a two-bar test of the old trend. Even when one does, the odds are high that there will be a larger pullback within the next 10 bars or\nso.\nThe test after the trend line break may fall short of the prior extreme or it may exceed it, but not by too much. With any countertrend trade, traders\nshould insist on a strong signal bar, because without it the odds of success are much less. For example, if there is a bear trend and then a sharp\nmove upward that extends well beyond the bear trend line, traders will look to buy on the first pullback, hoping for the first of many higher lows. They\nwill want a strong bull reversal bar or two-bar reversal before taking the trade. However, sometimes the pullback extends below the low of the bear\ntrend, running stops on the new longs. If this lower low reverses back up within a few bars, it can lead to a strong swing up. If, in contrast, the lower\nlow extends too far below the prior low, it is better to assume that the bear trend has begun a new leg down, and then wait for another trend line\nbreak, upward momentum surge, and a higher or lower low pullback, before going long again.\nAlthough traders love to buy the first higher low in a new bull trend or sell the first lower high in a new bear trend, if the new trend is good, there will\nbe a series of pullbacks with trending swings (higher highs and higher lows in a bull trend or lower highs and lower lows in a bear trend), and each\nof these pullbacks can provide an excellent entry. A pullback can be a strong bear spike, but as long as traders think the trend is now upward, they\nwill buy around the close of the strong bear trend bar, expecting no follow-through and looking for the bear reversal to fail. The bulls see the strong\nbear spike as a brief value opportunity. Beginners unfortunately see it as the start of a new bear trend, ignoring all of the bullishness of the prior\nbars and focusing on only this one- or two-bar bear spike. They short exactly where the strong bulls are buying. The bulls will expect every attempt\nby the bears to fail, and therefore look to buy each one. They will buy around the close of every bear trend bar, even if the bar is large and closes on\nits low. They will buy as the market falls below the low of the prior bar, any prior swing low, and any support level, like a trend line. They also will buy\nevery attempt by the market to go higher, like around the high of a bull trend bar or as the market moves above the high of the prior bar or above a\nresistance level. This is the exact opposite of what traders do in strong bear markets, when they sell above and below bars, and above and below\nboth resistance and support. They sell above bars (and around every type of resistance), including strong bull trend bars, because they see each\nmove up as an attempt to reverse the trend, and most trend reversal attempts fail. They sell below bars (and around every type of support), because\nthey see each move down as an attempt to resume the bear trend, and expect that most will succeed.\nThe first pullback after a reversal up into a new bull trend is usually a test of the bear low, but it may not even get very close to the bear low. It, like\nall subsequent pullbacks in the new bull trend, can also be a test of a breakout of a key point like the most recent signal bar high or entry bar low, a\ntrend line, a prior swing point, a trading range, or a moving average. After the market moves above the high of the first leg up, bulls will move their\nprotective stops up to just below this higher low. They will continue to trail their stops to just below the most recent higher low after every new higher\nhigh until they believe that the market is becoming two-sided enough to start having two-legged corrections down. Once they believe that the market\nwill have a second leg down that will likely fall below the low of the first leg down (the most recent higher low), they will look to exit their longs on\nstrength, like around the close of a bull trend bar that is at, above, or slightly below the trend’s high, or below the low of the prior bar. It does not\nmake sense for them to exit below the most recent higher low once they believe that the market will get there. Instead, they will exit higher and look\nto buy again around that higher low. If this bull flag is sideways, it could be a simple high 2, a triangle, or a double bottom; it could also form a lower\nlow and be a traditional ABC correction.\nAll trends are in channels, and most trends end with a breakout of the trend channel, which may not be obvious on the time frame of the chart in\nfront of you. For example, a bull trend typically ends in one of two ways. First, there can be a breakout above the channel in an attempt to create an\neven steeper bull trend. This only rarely succeeds and usually fails within one to five bars. The market then reverses back down below the trend\nchannel line and into the channel, and then the minimum target is a poke below the trend line at the bottom of the channel. This will usually have at\nleast a two-legged sideways to down correction and may lead to a trend reversal or a trading range. The pullback from the first leg down usually\nbecomes a lower high, and the second leg down will usually extend to some measured move target, like a leg 1 = leg 2 move or a projection based\non the height of the bear spike or of some trading range within the bull channel.\nAlternatively, the market can break below the bull trend line without first overshooting the trend channel line. The breakout can be a sharp spike\n", "text_clean": "the bulls who held through the sell-off will use this rally to begin to exit their longs.

In either case, the pullback that tests the bull high can be either a higher high or a lower high; they\noccur about equally frequently. Since at least two legs down will happen in about two-thirds of cases, a higher high should be followed by two legs\ndown, and a lower high may be followed by a single leg, since the first leg down already occurred just before the lower high formed. In the other third\nof cases, the reversal attempt fails, and the bull trend resumes or a trading range forms.\nIf the market forms a higher high in its test of the old bull high, one of the best trades is to look for a short setup on the first lower high, which is a\ntest of the higher high. In a bear trend where there is an upward momentum surge that breaks above a major bear trend line, traders will buy the first\nhigher low. Their buying lifts the market and reinforces everyone’s belief that a new bull trend might be beginning.\nAn important point is that trends last much longer than most traders would ever imagine. Because of that, most reversal patterns fail and evolve\ninto continuation setups, and most continuation patterns succeed. Traders have to be very careful when trading countertrend based on a reversal\npattern, but there are price action setups that greatly increase the chances of a profitable trade.\nSince most reversal attempts fail, many traders enter in the opposite direction. For example, if there is a bull trend and it forms a large bear trend\nbar closing on its low, most traders will expect this reversal attempt to fail, and many will buy at the close of the bear bar. If the next bar has a bull\nbody, they will buy at the close of that bar and above its high. The first target is the high of the bear trend bar, and the next target is a measured\nmove up, equal to the height of the bear trend bar. Some traders will use an initial protective stop that is about the same number of ticks as the bear\ntrend bar is tall, and others will use their usual stop, like two points in the Emini.\nIf you find yourself drawing many trend channel lines during a trend and seeing lots of wedge reversal setups, then you are too eager to find a\nreversal and are likely missing many great with-trend trades. Also, since most trend channel line overshoots and reversals are minor in a strong\ntrend and fail, you will be trading loser after loser and wondering why these patterns are failing when they are supposed to be so good. Wait for a\nstrong trend line break before looking for a countertrend trade; look at all those minor trend channel line overshoots as the start of with-trend setups,\nand enter where the losers are exiting on their protective stops. You will be much happier, more relaxed, and richer, and you will be entertained by\nhow well they work when intuitively they should not.\nOne of the reasons it is so tempting for a beginner to sell rallies in a strong bull trend is that the market spends so much time near the high of the\nleg, and one gets impatient waiting for a pullback that never seems to come. Also, there does not seem to be enough room to the top of the screen\nfor the market to go any higher, so it is easy to imagine that it has to go lower. The market is so overdone that there surely has to be an imminent\nregression to the mean in the form of a reversal that will fall far enough to make at least a scalper’s profit. Traders begin to believe that they have to\ndo something in the meantime while they wait for the market to pull back, and as traders, they assume that they must trade. Instead, they should\nthink of themselves as traders who must make a lot of money, not a lot of trades. Since they are afraid to buy at the high and they believe that a\npullback is overdue, they short, expecting that they will make money as the market begins to pull back. Most of the time, the market will pull back a\nlittle but then reverse back up. It does not fall far enough for them to make a profit on their countertrend short scalps, and they are stopped out with a\nloss. The bull trend then resumes again in a quick breakout, and they are on the sidelines, watching, feeling sad, and a little bit poorer. Experienced\ntraders take the other side of this trade. Many place limit orders to buy at the low of that weak bear signal bar, and others place stop orders to get\nlong at one tick above the high of the prior bar in the small pullback. When the pullback sets up a long, beginners are still fixated on that top that led\nto the pullback, and they are afraid that the market might fall further. Or they are still short, hoping for the market to drop just a little more so that they\ncan make a profit on their short scalp. Surely one of their short scalps has to work. They just lost on their last four shorts, and the market has to\nrealize how unfair it has been, and will now make up for it by giving them a profit. They do not accept that it is all math and has nothing to do with\nfairness or emotion. After several months or years of losing, they decide that when they see a bull trend, they will not take a single short all day. That\nis the day when they stop losing money. After many months, they decide that when there is a bull trend, they are only going to buy pullbacks and\ntake no other trades. That is the day that they begin to make money.\nIn a bull trend, buyers continue to buy until they decide that the trader’s equation is no longer as favorable as they would like it to be, and at that\npoint they begin to take partial profits. As the market continues to rise, they continue to take more profits and are not eager to buy again until there\nis a pullback. Also, shorts are being squeezed out of the market as the market continues upward, and they are being forced to buy back their short\npositions. At some point, they will have covered all that they wish to cover, and their buying will stop. There will also be momentum traders who will\ncontinue to buy as long as there is good momentum, but these traders will be quick to take profits once the momentum slows. The market will\ncontinue up until it overshoots the directional probability of an equidistant move. The bulls and bears are never sure when that probability is 50\npercent, and the trend will continue until the math clearly favors a move down. Neutrality is never clear, and excess is much easier to spot. It will\nalways occur at some magnet area, but since there are so many to choose from, it is difficult to know which will work. Usually, there has to be a\nconfluence of magnets before a pullback will develop. Some firms will be placing trades based on one or more magnets, and other firms will use\ndifferent ones; but once there is a critical mass of firms expecting a pullback, the market will turn. The critical mass comes when the selling\npressure becomes greater than the buying pressure and is due to more dollars being traded by traders expecting a pullback. There will no longer\nbe a shortage of offers, requiring the market to go higher to find traders to take the other side of the bull trades. Instead, traders will be quick to\nplace shorts at the offer. In fact, they will start shorting at the bid and the market will have to go lower to find enough buyers to fill the large number of\nsell orders. Those sellers will be a combination of bulls selling out of their longs and bears establishing shorts.\nSo who is buying that last tick at the top of a bull trend or selling the low of a bear trend? Is it the accumulation of countless small traders who are\ngetting caught up in the panic and either are on the wrong side and being forced to liquidate in the face of rapidly growing losses or are flat and\nimpulsively entering late in a rapidly moving trend? If only we could be so influential! That might have been the case long ago, but not in today’s\nmarket. If there is so much volume at the high and low of the day and the institutions make up most of that volume, why would they buy the high tick\nof the day if they are so smart? The majority of the day’s volume is driven by statistically based mathematical algorithms, and some of those models\nwill continue to buy until there is a clear trend change, and only then will they reverse to the short side. These momentum programs will buy right up\nto the last tick of a bull trend and short to the very low of a bear trend because the designers of the systems have determined that this approach\nmaximizes their profit. Remember, there is inertia in a trend and trends are very resistant to ending, so betting on them continuing is a good bet.\nBecause they trade such huge volume, there is an ample supply of buying at the high to take the other side of the huge volume of shorts that is\ncoming in at the top (and vice versa at the bottom).\nJust because they are very smart and trade huge volume does not mean that they are making a 5 percent profit a day. In fact, the best of them\nare netting a fraction of a percentage point each day, and some of them have determined that their profit is maximized by continuing to buy, even\nincluding the high tick of the day, because they believe that the market might go at least a tick or two higher. Many high-frequency trading (HFT)\nalgorithms are designed to make very small profits on each trade, and if these quant firms have done tests that tell them that they can make a\ncouple more ticks by buying at the high, they will continue to buy. Many firms also have complex strategies involving options and other products, and\nit is impossible to know what all the factors are at play at the extremes of the day. For example, they might be expecting a reversal down and be\n", "text_clean": "down or a sideways drift into a trading range. In either case, the pullback that tests the bull high can be either a higher high or a lower high; they occur about equally frequently. Since at least two legs down will happen in about two-thirds of cases, a higher high should be followed by two legs down, and a lower high may be followed by a single leg, since the first leg down already occurred just before the lower high formed. In the other third of cases, the reversal attempt fails, and the bull trend resumes or a trading range forms.\nIf the market forms a higher high in its test of the old bull high, one of the best trades is to look for a short setup on the first lower high, which is a test of the higher high. In a bear trend where there is an upward momentum surge that breaks above a major bear trend line, traders will buy the first higher low. Their buying lifts the market and reinforces everyone’s belief that a new bull trend might be beginning.\nAn important point is that trends last much longer than most traders would ever imagine. Because of that, most reversal patterns fail and evolve into continuation setups, and most continuation patterns succeed. Traders have to be very careful when trading countertrend based on a reversal pattern, but there are price action setups that greatly increase the chances of a profitable trade.\nSince most reversal attempts fail, many traders enter in the opposite direction. For example, if there is a bull trend and it forms a large bear trend bar closing on its low, most traders will expect this reversal attempt to fail, and many will buy at the close of the bear bar. If the next bar has a bull body, they will buy at the close of that bar and above its high. The first target is the high of the bear trend bar, and the next target is a measured move up, equal to the height of the bear trend bar. Some traders will use an initial protective stop that is about the same number of ticks as the bear trend bar is tall, and others will use their usual stop, like two points in the Emini.\nIf you find yourself drawing many trend channel lines during a trend and seeing lots of wedge reversal setups, then you are too eager to find a reversal and are likely missing many great with-trend trades. Also, since most trend channel line overshoots and reversals are minor in a strong trend and fail, you will be trading loser after loser and wondering why these patterns are failing when they are supposed to be so good. Wait for a strong trend line break before looking for a countertrend trade; look at all those minor trend channel line overshoots as the start of with-trend setups, and enter where the losers are exiting on their protective stops. You will be much happier, more relaxed, and richer, and you will be entertained by how well they work when intuitively they should not.\nOne of the reasons it is so tempting for a beginner to sell rallies in a strong bull trend is that the market spends so much time near the high of the leg, and one gets impatient waiting for a pullback that never seems to come.

They lose only if the market goes\nsideways in a very tight range for several days. If the market goes up, the puts will lose money at a slower rate than the rate at which the Eminis gain\nin value. If the market falls, the puts will increase in value faster than the long Eminis will fall in value, and their neutral spread becomes increasingly\nmore of a bear play. This will allow them to profit, even though they bought the Eminis at the high of the day. All that you need to know is that there is\nhuge volume at the extremes, and it is coming from institutions, some of which are buying the high while others are selling it.\nIncidentally, there is one other common sign of just how active mathematical, computer-generated trading is. Just look at correlated markets, like\nthe Emini and all of the related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the SPY, and you will see that they basically move tick for tick. This is also true\nfor other related markets. This could not be taking place so perfectly all day long if it was being done manually. Also, chart patterns would not be as\nperfect as they are on all time frames, even down to tick charts, unless a huge volume of the trading was computer generated. People simply\ncannot analyze and place orders that quickly in so many markets simultaneously, so the perfection has to be the result of computer-generated\ntrades, and they must make up the majority of the trading volume.\nWhen there is a strong trend with no significant pullbacks, it is common to start looking for a small reversal because common sense dictates that\nthe market will eventually have to pull back as traders begin to take partial profits and enough countertrend traders take new positions. Regression\nto a mean logic works everywhere in life and it should in trading as well. And it does, but it usually occurs after the market has reached a far greater\nextreme than most traders could imagine. A trader will have to decide if it is better to look for a countertrend scalp or to wait for the pullback to end\nand then enter in the direction of the trend. If the trend is strong, it is usually better to trade countertrend only if there are clear signs of a trend\nreversal, such as a prior strong trend line breakout and then a test that ends with a strong reversal bar. However, the temptation is great to do\nsomething, and many traders will begin to look at smaller time frame charts, like a 1 minute or 100 tick chart. Smaller time frame charts continue to\nform reversals as the trend progresses, and the vast majority of the reversals fail. A trader can rationalize taking the countertrend trade by thinking\nthat a 1 minute chart has small bars so the risk is only about four ticks, and if this turns out to be the very top of the market, the potential gain is\nhuge. Therefore, taking a few small losses is worth it. Invariably, the few small losses turn into six or seven and their combined effect is a loss that\ncannot be recovered later in the day. When traders get lucky and pick the exact end of a trend, they will scalp out with a few ticks of profit instead of\nriding the trade for a long way, as they originally had planned. This is death by mathematics. It’s great to feel smart enough to buy the low of a bear\ntrend or short the high of a bull trend, but if you lose in nine out of 10 attempts, you will slowly go broke. In general, buying pullbacks in bull trends\nand selling rallies in bear trends is a much better approach for most traders. There are far more trades, and the winning percentage is higher.\nIf you are becoming agitated because you are not in the market during an extended trend and you feel like you need to trade so you begin to look\nat a 1 minute chart, those 1 minute reversals offer a very profitable way to make money. However, it is by doing the opposite of the obvious. Wait\nfor a 1 minute reversal to trigger a countertrend entry, which you do not take, and then determine where you would place a protective stop if you had\ntaken the trade. Then, place a stop order to enter with trend at that price. You will be stopped into a with-trend position just as the countertrend\ntraders are getting stopped out. No one will be looking to enter countertrend at that point and likely not until the trend has moved far enough to make\na profit before the next countertrend setup begins to form. This is a very high-probability with-trend scalp.\nThe single most reliable countertrend trade is actually a with-trend trade on a larger time frame. A pullback is a small trend against the larger\ntrend, and when you enter against the trend of that pullback, you are entering in the direction of the larger trend. Once the pullback traders have\nexhausted themselves and the trend traders have again demonstrated their resolve by breaking the trend line that contained the pullback, any small\npullback to test this breakout is a great breakout pullback entry. This entry is counter to the trend of the pullback, but in the direction of the major\ntrend, and will usually lead to at least a test of the major trend’s extreme. The more momentum that is present in the trend line break, the more likely\nit is that trade will be profitable. For example, if there is a bull flag, you can buy the bottom of the bull flag, the breakout of the bull flag, or on a small\npullback from that breakout for a test of the high of the bull trend.\nMomentum in a reversal can be in the form of a few large trend bars or a trending series of average-looking bars. The more signs of strength, the\nmore reliable the reversal will be. These are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2 of book 2 on the strength of breakouts and in Chapter 19 of\nbook 1 on the strength of trends. Ideally, the first leg of the reversal will extend for many bars, break well beyond the moving average, have the\nmajority of the bars be trend bars in the direction of the new trend, and extend beyond swing points in the prior trend (if the prior trend was a bull\ntrend, then it is a sign of strength if the first leg of the new bear trend drops below and closes below one or more of the higher lows of that prior bull\ntrend).\nBig traders don’t hesitate to enter a trend during its spike phase, because they expect significant follow-through, even if there is a pullback\nimmediately after their entry. If a pullback occurs, they increase the size of their position. For example, if there is a strong bull breakout lasting\nseveral bars, more and more institutions become convinced that the market has become always-in long with each new higher tick, and as they\nbelieve that the market will go higher, they start buying. This makes the spike grow very quickly. They have many ways to enter, like buying at the\nmarket, buying a one- or two-tick pullback, buying above the prior bar on a stop, or buying on a breakout above a prior swing high. It does not\nmatter how they get in, because their focus is to get at least a small position on and then look to buy more as the market moves higher or if it pulls\nback. Because they will add on as the market goes higher, the spike can extend for many bars. Beginning traders see the growing spike and\nwonder how anyone could be buying at the top of such a huge move. What they don’t understand is that the institutions are so confident that the\nmarket will soon be higher that they will buy all of the way up, because they don’t want to miss the move while waiting for a pullback to form.\nBeginners are also afraid that their stops would have to be below the bottom of the spike, or at least below its midpoint, which is far away. The\ninstitutions know this, and simply adjust their position size down to a level where their dollars at risk are the same for any other trade. At some point,\nthe early buyers take some profits, and then the market pulls back a little. When it does, the traders who want a larger position quickly buy, thereby\nkeeping the initial pullback small.\nAlthough the best reversals have strong momentum and go a long way, they often are very slow to start and can have several small bars before\nthe sharp moves begin. The result is that most trend reversal setups have a less than 50 percent chance of success. For example, a reversal up in\na new bull trend often starts as a low-momentum rally with overlapping bars and pullbacks, making many traders believe that another bear flag is\nforming. The first pullback is a low 1 short setup. However, traders should not short a low 1 unless the market is in a strong bear spike in a clear\nbear trend, so this low 1 is likely to fail. Aggressive traders will instead buy at the bottom and below the low 1 signal bar, expecting it to fail. There is\noften then a low 2 short setup. However, if you believe that the trend has reversed up, this is also likely to fail and again aggressive bulls will buy with\nlimit orders at and below the low of the low 2 signal bar. Once it does fail, traders will see this failed low 2 as a failed bear flag, and it often leads to\na strong breakout to the upside. That bear flag becomes the final flag in the bear trend, even though it never broke out to the downside by more than\na tick or so. Sometimes the market has one more push up into a wedge bear flag before the upside breakout forms.\nYou can think of the bear flag as an attempt by the market to trap you out of the long trade that you entered a few bars earlier on the first reversal\nup so that you will have to chase the move up and add fuel to the new bull trend.

This is a very high-probability with-trend scalp.\nThe single most reliable countertrend trade is actually a with-trend trade on a larger time frame. A pullback is a small trend against the larger trend, and when you enter against the trend of that pullback, you are entering in the direction of the larger trend. Once the pullback traders have exhausted themselves and the trend traders have again demonstrated their resolve by breaking the trend line that contained the pullback, any small pullback to test this breakout is a great breakout pullback entry. This entry is counter to the trend of the pullback, but in the direction of the major trend, and will usually lead to at least a test of the major trend’s extreme. The more momentum that is present in the trend line break, the more likely it is that trade will be profitable. For example, if there is a bull flag, you can buy the bottom of the bull flag, the breakout of the bull flag, or on a small pullback from that breakout for a test of the high of the bull trend.\nMomentum in a reversal can be in the form of a few large trend bars or a trending series of average-looking bars. The more signs of strength, the more reliable the reversal will be. These are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2 of book 2 on the strength of breakouts and in Chapter 19 of book 1 on the strength of trends. Ideally, the first leg of the reversal will extend for many bars, break well beyond the moving average, have the majority of the bars be trend bars in the direction of the new trend, and extend beyond swing points in the prior trend (if the prior trend was a bull trend, then it is a sign of strength if the first leg of the new bear trend drops below and closes below one or more of the higher lows of that prior bull trend).\nBig traders don’t hesitate to enter a trend during its spike phase, because they expect significant follow-through, even if there is a pullback immediately after their entry. If a pullback occurs, they increase the size of their position. For example, if there is a strong bull breakout lasting several bars, more and more institutions become convinced that the market has become always-in long with each new higher tick, and as they believe that the market will go higher, they start buying. This makes the spike grow very quickly. They have many ways to enter, like buying at the market, buying a one- or two-tick pullback, buying above the prior bar on a stop, or buying on a breakout above a prior swing high. It does not matter how they get in, because their focus is to get at least a small position on and then look to buy more as the market moves higher or if it pulls back. Because they will add on as the market goes higher, the spike can extend for many bars. Beginning traders see the growing spike and wonder how anyone could be buying at the top of such a huge move. What they don’t understand is that the institutions are so confident that the market will soon be higher that they will buy all of the way up, because they don’t want to miss the move while waiting for a pullback to form.\nBeginners are also afraid that their stops would have to be below the bottom of the spike, or at least below its midpoint, which is far away. The institutions know this, and simply adjust their position size down to a level where their dollars at risk are the same for any other trade. At some point, the early buyers take some profits, and then the market pulls back a little. When it does, the traders who want a larger position quickly buy, thereby keeping the initial pullback small.\nAlthough the best reversals have strong momentum and go a long way, they often are very slow to start and can have several small bars before the sharp moves begin. The result is that most trend reversal setups have a less than 50 percent chance of success. For example, a reversal up in a new bull trend often starts as a low-momentum rally with overlapping bars and pullbacks, making many traders believe that another bear flag is forming. The first pullback is a low 1 short setup. However, traders should not short a low 1 unless the market is in a strong bear spike in a clear bear trend, so this low 1 is likely to fail. Aggressive traders will instead buy at the bottom and below the low 1 signal bar, expecting it to fail. There is often then a low 2 short setup. However, if you believe that the trend has reversed up, this is also likely to fail and again aggressive bulls will buy with limit orders at and below the low of the low 2 signal bar. Once it does fail, traders will see this failed low 2 as a failed bear flag, and it often leads to a strong breakout to the upside. That bear flag becomes the final flag in the bear trend, even though it never broke out to the downside by more than a tick or so. Sometimes the market has one more push up into a wedge bear flag before the upside breakout forms.\nYou can think of the bear flag as an attempt by the market to trap you out of the long trade that you entered a few bars earlier on the first reversal up so that you will have to chase the move up and add fuel to the new bull trend.

This happens so quickly that many bulls who were looking to buy the failed low 1 or low 2 become paralyzed. They were hoping for a\nquiet buy signal bar with a high near the bottom of the low 2 signal bar, and instead they are being forced into a quick decision. Do they want to buy\nan outside up bar at what could be the top of a bear flag? Most traders will hesitate and wait for a pullback to buy, but at this point everyone\nbelieves that the bears have lost and that the market is going higher. They don’t know if there will be a pullback in the next several bars, but they do\nknow that if there is, it will be followed by a new high to the bull leg. When that kind of clear always-in mentality is present, there usually will not be a\npullback until the market is much higher. That is why it is important to buy at least a small position. The mathematics of bull spikes is discussed in\nPart I of book 2 on breakouts and even more so in Chapter 25 in book 2 on the mathematics of trading, but the important thing to remember is that\nif you are trapped out of the market, enter at least a small position at the market or on a one- or two-tick pullback, and place a very wide stop. The\nmathematics of this trade is strongly in your favor.\nThe low 1, low 2, or wedge bear flag will trap weak new bulls out and force them to reenter the new bull trend at a much worse price. Some of the\nstrongest trends come from these traps because they tell traders that the last bear trend trader just got burned and there is no one left from the old\ntrend. Also, they tell us that weak bull traders just got out and now will be chasing the new bull trend, adding orders in the new direction. This gives\ntraders confidence. When this kind of agitated reversal happens after a trend line break and on the test of the trend’s extreme, the new trend will\nusually last for at least 10 bars and it will retrace a good portion of the most recent part of the old trend.\nEven if there are no pullback bars on the 5 minute chart, it is common at the very start of a trend to find pullbacks on 1 and 3 minute charts, which\nalso trap traders out. Sometimes traders will enter based on a 5 minute signal and think they are clever by using a stop based on a smaller time\nframe chart. When the 5 minute signal is strong, this will usually be a mistake. It is better to suffer through a few bars of anxiety than to exit on a\nsmaller time frame chart, because you will get trapped out of too many great trends.\nIf a trader enters early but the move is hesitant (for example, with overlapping bars) for a few bars, this should not be a concern, especially if\nthose bars are mostly trend bars in the right direction. This is a sign of strength, and everyone is watching and waiting for the momentum to begin\nbefore entering. A good price action trader can often get in before that happens and then is able to move her stop to breakeven soon after the\nmomentum starts, allowing her to make a lot of money with minimal risk. If you are confident in your read, take your trade, and don’t worry that no\none else sees what you see yet. They eventually will. Make sure to swing part or even all of your position even though you sometimes will get\nstopped out on your breakeven stop once or twice before the trend begins its run.\nSo what is the best reversal setup? It is the end of a pullback when the short-term countertrend move is ending and reversing back into the\ndirection of the major trend. In other words, the best reversals are a bull flag in a bull trend just as it is breaking out to the upside and a bear flag in a\nbear trend just as it is reversing back down. Major reversals are less common since most reversal attempts fail and become flags. A reversal trade\ncan be based on a traditional reversal after a trend line break and then a test of the extreme, followed by a very strong countertrend spike that leads\nto an always-in flip to the opposite trend. If it comes after a trend line break, there is often a second entry. If the trend was strong, it is usually better\nto wait for that second entry; but if it does not come, the market will likely create a strong enough countertrend spike to make most traders believe\nthat the always-in position has reversed. For example, if there is a bull trend and traders are looking for a reversal but the setup is not particularly\nstrong, they should wait to see if the market will give a second entry in the form of a lower high or a higher high within the next five bars or so. If it\ndoes not and it instead sells off for four or five bars, breaks out of a pattern, and then has follow-through on the next bar, this will be enough bear\nstrength to convince most traders that the always-in position has flipped to short. They will sell either at the market or on pullbacks.\nMuch of this material is in book 2 on trading ranges, but it is relevant here as well because of the widespread misconception that reversal\npatterns are reliable. Since trends are constantly creating reversal patterns and they all fail except the final one, it is misleading to think of these\ncommonly discussed patterns as reversal patterns. It is far more accurate to think of them as continuation patterns that rarely fail, but when they do,\nthe failure can lead to a reversal. It is a mistake to see every top or bottom as a great reversal setup, because if you take all of those countertrend\nentries, the majority of your trades will be losers and your occasional wins will not be enough to offset your losses. However, if you are selective and\nlook for other evidence that a trend might reverse, these can be effective setups.\nAll head and shoulders tops and bottoms are really head and shoulders continuation patterns (flags) because they are trading ranges, and like all\ntrading ranges, they are much more likely to break out in the direction of the trend and only rarely reverse the trend. The same is true for double tops\nand bottoms. For example, if there is a head and shoulders top in a bull market, a breakout below the neckline will usually fail and the market will\nmost likely then reverse up and have a with-trend breakout to the upside, above the right shoulder. The pattern is a triangle, a triple bottom, or a\nwedge bull flag, and the three pushes down are the down legs after the left shoulder, the head, and the right shoulder. Other bulls see the move\ndown from the head to the neckline as a bull flag, and the rally that forms the right shoulder as the breakout above the bull flag. The sell-off from the\nright shoulder to the neckline is then either a lower low or higher low pullback from that breakout, and if the market reverses up, the bulls see the\nreversal as a buy setup.\nSince the right shoulder is a lower high, the bears see it as the first pullback in a new bear trend, and therefore the rally to the right shoulder is a\nbear flag. If the market trades above the right shoulder, the bear flag will have failed, and the market usually rallies for a measured move up based\non either the height of the right shoulder or the entire head and shoulders top. Also, if there is a bear market that is forming a trading range and that\ntrading range assumes the shape of a head and shoulders top, a break below the neckline is a with-trend breakout of a bear flag and is likely to\nlead to lower prices.\nSimilarly, head and shoulders bottoms are also with-trend setups. A head and shoulders bottom in a bear trend is usually a triangle or a wedge\nbear flag and should break out to the downside, below the right shoulder. A head and shoulders bottom in a bull market is a bull flag and should\nbreak out to the upside, above the neckline. The right shoulder itself is a smaller bull flag, and if the market trades below it, it has failed, and a sell-\noff usually ensues.\nThe vast majority of reversals are related to trading ranges. Since trading ranges are flags and usually break out in the direction of the trend,\nmost reversal patterns do not lead to reversals. Therefore, there are no reliable (high probability) reversal patterns. For example, when there is a\nbull trend, most double tops, triple tops, head and shoulders tops, and triangle tops break to the upside instead of the downside, and are bull flags\nand do not lead to reversals. Occasionally, one will instead break to the downside and lead to a reversal. When that happens, traders apply one of\nthe reversal pattern names to refer to the trading range; they select the name that best describes the shape of the range. Many upside breakouts of\nbull flags soon reverse down and then the market breaks to the downside, creating a reversal. When that happens, the bull flag becomes the final\nflag in the bull trend (discussed in Chapter 7). Most climactic reversals are usually variations of final flag reversals. The opposite is true in bear\ntrends where most reversal patterns are bear flags and lead to bear breakouts. When one instead leads to a bull breakout (whether or not it first\nbreaks to the downside, reverses up, and becomes the final flag in the bear trend), traders then apply the name of the reversal pattern that best\ndescribes the shape of the trading range.\nWhen a reversal is gradual, like when it comes from a trading range, the trading range is traditionally called an area of distribution at the end of a\n", "text_clean": "outside up bar.

When there is a trading range bottom, the bulls are said to be accumulating their longs,\nwhich means that they are buying as they build a long position. Since short selling has become so common, it is logical to refer to the trading range\nat the top of a bull trend as an area of distribution by the bulls and an area of accumulation for the bears, who are building a short position.\nLikewise, when there is a trading range bottom in a bear trend, it is an area of accumulation for the bulls and an area of distribution for the bears\nwho are taking profits on their shorts.\nMany days that become reversal days on the daily chart are trending trading range days on the 5 minute chart. For example, if there is a bear\ntrending trading range day and later in the day it breaks back into the upper trading range, which is common, and rallies to the top of that upper\ntrading range and closes near the high of the day, the day will be a bull reversal day on the daily chart (discussed more in Chapter 22 of book 1).\nTypically, entries in trend pullbacks look bad but are profitable, and entries in reversals look reasonably good but are losers.

Maybe there is too much overlap with the prior bars or too many dojis, or the reversal bar is too small or pulls back several ticks in the\nseconds before it closes, or there is no prior break of a significant trend line, or there has been no failed breakout of a trend channel line. These\nalmost perfect reversals sucker you in and trap you, so you should never take a reversal trade unless it is clear and strong. Most of the time, you\nshould wait to buy after there is a higher low in a new bull trend and wait to sell after a lower high in a new bear trend.\nMany traders look for countertrend scalps. They become impatient as they wait for a strong reversal that should have at least two legs and they\ninstead take a weak signal. For example, they might buy a bull reversal bar at a swing low in a bear trend. However, if they believe that the trend is\nstill down and they are only looking for a scalp, they need to have a plan to get out if their trade fails. Many traders will allow the market to trigger a\nlow 1 short if they believe that there should be a second leg up. They will hold long and hope for the low 1 short to fail and form a higher low. If the\nmarket then does not go up much and instead forms a low 2 short setup, most traders would exit if the low 2 triggers. If the low 2 does not trigger\nand there is one more small push up, this is a low 3 setup, which is a wedge bear flag. Bulls must exit if it triggers, because it is a strong sell signal\nin a bear trend. They don’t want a trend to attempt to resume twice, and many will correctly reverse to short as the low 2 or 3 triggers. They needed\nthe higher low to hold if the market was going to turn up and if it is now forming a low 2 or 3 short, they don’t want to risk to below that higher low.\nRather than wait for a protective stop below the higher low to be hit, they will exit their long on the low 2 or 3 short entry because they know that the\nbears will begin to short aggressively there, and many more shorts will come in below that higher low. They know that in about 80 percent of cases,\na low 2 or 3 short in a strong bear trend will hit the stops below the higher low, and they want to minimize their losses. This is one of the reasons why\nlow 2 and 3 shorts are so reliable in strong bear trends and high 2 and 3 longs are reliable in strong bull trends. The trapped countertrend scalpers\nwill take their losses there and not look for another countertrend trade for at least a couple more bars. This makes the market one-sided in favor of\nthe trend traders.\nThere is a rhythm to the market as it forms alternating trends. One trend will often end with a trend channel line overshoot and reversal followed by\na two-legged move that breaks the trend line. The two legs then allow for the drawing of a channel for the new trend. Some trends end with simply a\ntrend line break and then a test, followed by a second leg. Again, these two legs form a new trend channel that may be the start of a new trend or\nsimply a flag in the old trend. If the new trend is weak, it will usually just result in a pullback and then a resumption of the old trend. Traders should\nalways be drawing or at least visualizing trend lines and trend channel lines and watching how the market reacts when it tests these lines.\nMajor reversals from bear markets are often volatile with large bars and several pushes up and down creating one to several sell climaxes.\nPeople think that the worst is over but then realize “Oops, I’m too early,” and they are quick to sell out. This can happen several times before the\nfinal bottom is in and accounts for why so many major reversals end with large range bars and either a failed flag or a three-push pattern. Climactic\nreversals with big bars and huge volume are more common at bottoms than at tops. More often, a top comes from a trading range, like a double\ntop or a head and shoulders top, followed by a downside breakout in the form of a strong bear spike. However, tops can be climactic, and bottoms\ncan be trading ranges.\nWhen the market is in a bull trend on the higher time frame charts, the 5 minute chart often has a rally into the close, and the bar of the daily chart\nhas a higher chance of being a bull trend bar. If the market has started to sell off into the closes of recent days, the market might be transitioning\ninto a bear trend or at least into a bigger pullback. Pay attention to what the market does in the final 30 to 60 minutes, because it often is a\nreflection of the higher time frame trend. That sell-off into the close can be from mutual fund redemptions, from long liquidation by day traders, and\nobviously from programs, which make up most of the day’s volume. The programs are based on math and if the math is indicating that the market\nshould fall into the close, the market might be in the process of transitioning from a trend into a trading range or even a bear trend. Those low\ncloses create weak bars on the higher time frame charts, and traders will see them as a sign of building selling pressure. This will make them hold\noff buying until the pullbacks are deeper, and it will encourage bears to short more aggressively. This is not good for the bulls. The opposite is true\nof a bear trend on the 60 minute or daily charts. Strong rallies into the close of the day on the 5 minute chart often mean that the next rally might be\nlarge and that it might be the start of a bull reversal.\nSignificant tops in the S&P are often presaged by a big down day or two in a bellwether stock like Apple (AAPL). If the market leaders are selling\noff, the market might be topping. Traders usually take profits on their big winners if they expect a bigger correction in the overall market. In a strong\nstock market, some stocks tend to rise faster than others. At these times, traders look for “risk-on” trades and invest heavily in these stocks (and\ncurrencies, like the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Swedish krona). Once they believe that the stock market is\ngoing to turn down, they sell their risk-on stocks and buy “risk-off” stocks and currencies, like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Altria Group (MO), Procter\n& Gamble (PG), the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen. They also invest in risk-off currencies, gold, and Treasury notes and bonds\nwhen they are afraid of some international event and want to make sure that their money will be safe and readily available whenever they need it.\nWhen a strong bull trend begins to top out, the institutions transition from overweighting to regular weighting of their stocks, and this often causes\nthe market leaders to turn down several days before the overall market. For example, if AAPL is up 40 percent over the past year and the S&P is\noverbought, and then Apple loses 3 percent in one day, it might be a sign that big traders think that the market might turn down in the coming days.\nThere is a natural tendency to take profits where you have them, and if you have a lot in a major tech stock like Apple and you are expecting the\noverall market to pull back 5 to 10 percent, you might first take profits in the stocks where the profits are the greatest. If many funds do this in one\nday, Apple can fall 3 percent at the top. This might be a sign that the funds are ready to start taking profits in their other stocks as well. If they do, the\noverall market might correct. As the overall market falls, traders get margin calls, and they tend to sell out of the stocks where they have the most\nprofits, which are the market leaders. This can cause the stocks that rose the fastest in the bull trend to fall the fastest in the correction.\nThe mathematics of reversals is similar to that of breakouts. In general, if the setup is strong, you believe that there is at least a 60 percent\nchance of a minimum of a two-legged move that will last at least 10 bars. In most cases, your profit target will be two or more times greater than\nyour risk, and that great risk/reward ratio, combined with the high probability of success, makes reversal trades so appealing to traders.

When there is a trading range top, the bulls are said to be distributing their longs, which simply means that they are selling out to take profits. When there is a trading range bottom, the bulls are said to be accumulating their longs, which means that they are buying as they build a long position. Since short selling has become so common, it is logical to refer to the trading range at the top of a bull trend as an area of distribution by the bulls and an area of accumulation for the bears, who are building a short position.\nLikewise, when there is a trading range bottom in a bear trend, it is an area of accumulation for the bulls and an area of distribution for the bears who are taking profits on their shorts.\nMany days that become reversal days on the daily chart are trending trading range days on the 5 minute chart.

These weak setups constantly trap overly eager reversal traders, and as they are forced out with losses, they add fuel to the growing trend.\nHowever, there are many signs that traders can use to identify reliable setups, and these signs of strength are detailed in the next chapter.\nMost initial entries have relatively low probability (about 40 to 50 percent) of success. Some traders prefer a higher probability, and they wait for\nstrong follow-through and a clear always-in flip. The trade-off is a smaller reward for a higher chance of success. Both approaches can be\nmathematically sound, and traders should choose the approach that best suits their personalities. For example, when the average range in the\nEmini is about 10 to 15 points, the probability of a four-point swing on a reasonably good-looking reversal (one where the context is good and there\nis a decent signal bar) is often only about 40 percent (it can be 50 to 60 percent when the setup is very strong). However, the chance of a two-point\nstop being hit before either the profit target is reached or a reversal signal develops, where the trader can exit with a smaller loss or a small profit,\nis often only about 30 percent. This makes the trader’s equation very favorable for this type of trade. If traders win four points in four out of 10\ntrades, they have 16 points of profit off of their swing trades. If their other trades consist of maybe three losses of two points or less and three wins\nof about one to three points, they will end up about breakeven on those trades. This is fairly typical when traders pick appropriate setups. They then\nhave about 16 points of profit on 10 trades, or an average of 1.6 points of profit per trade, which is good for a day trader. Remember, most traders\nwill not take any reversal trade, no matter how minor, unless there is at least a double top or bottom, a micro double top or bottom, or a final flag.\nFIGURE PI.1 Dow Jones Industrials Monthly Chart\nMost reversal patterns fail at least 80 percent of the time, and the large head and shoulders top on the monthly Dow Jones Industrials chart shown in\nFigure PI.1 will likely fail as well and become a large wedge bull flag or some other type of bull flag. With the spike down to bar 13 as strong as it\nwas, it will probably get tested by a lower low, where the pattern will probably form a wedge bull flag and be followed by a new high a decade or two\nlater. At the moment, the rally from bar 13 is a rally from the double bottom with bar 9.\nBar 8 is the top of the left shoulder, bar 11 is the head, and the right shoulder is in the process of forming at bar 16, but it may extend higher\nbefore the market reverses down, if it reverses down. It might reach a new high and form an expanding triangle top, or it might break out into a new\nbull leg and then continue up for a measured move based on the height of the trading range. This could be from the bar 9 low to the bar 8 or bar 11\nhigh, or the bar 13 low to the bar 11 high.\nNewsletter writers who make their living by selling fear will make a fortune by scaring people into believing that the Dow will fall for a measured\nmove down to below 1,000 without understanding that this is a trading range in a bull trend, and therefore the odds are 80 percent or better that it\nwill break out to the upside before dropping far below bar 13. For a trader, it is far better to bet on the 80 percent, but newsletter writers who make\ntheir living by selling fear make more money from being right 20 percent of the time or less. They need catastrophic events to be rare so that people\nworry about their financial death. If crashes were common, people would learn to trade them and there wouldn’t be enough fear for these writers to\nstay rich.\nThe market will probably form a dueling lines bottom around the bull trend line drawn below the bars 1, 2, and 4 lows, which it will probably\novershoot, and the trend channel line drawn below the bars 9 and 13 lows, which is the neckline of the head and shoulders top. Incidentally, notice\nhow the 2008–2009 crash reversed up after breaking below the bull trend line drawn from the bar 4 and bar 5 lows, and from below the bars 7 and\n9 double bottom. This is what usually happens. The market has been in a trading range since around bar 7, and most attempts to break out of a\ntrading range fail. The market has inertia and tends to continue to do what it has been doing. This also makes most attempts to reverse a trend fail.\nBears see the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top as a lower high and the first pullback in a new bear trend. It is therefore a bear flag. If\nthe market clearly breaks well below the bear flag, whether or not it also breaks below the neckline of the head and shoulders top, and then\nreverses up and rallies above the top of the right shoulder, the pattern will have failed. The rally will usually reach a measured move target based on\nthe height either of the right shoulder or of the entire head and shoulders top. Some traders see the neckline as a horizontal line drawn across the\nbottom between the head and the right shoulder (here, the bar 13 low), whereas others see it as the trend channel line drawn across the lows on\nboth sides of the head (bars 9 and 13).\nThe move down to bar 13 had such strong momentum that it will likely be tested, and since the down move was so strong, the test will probably\nbe a lower low. That should trap bears in and bulls out, and then the odds favor the market reversing up in a wedge bull flag. If that is the case, the\nmost likely course from there would be a breakout above bar 11 and a measured move up, but it might take a decade or two before that happens.\nIn the days leading up to the bar 13 crash low, a trader familiar with a dueling lines pattern would have seen the potential for a reversal up,\nespecially after the small final flag from several bars earlier, the consecutive sell climaxes, and the large expanding triangle bull flag (bars 7, 8, 9,\n11, and 13).\nIf the market does sell off from a lower high around bar 9, it might find support at the trend line drawn from the bar 1 and bar 4 lows. This is an\nespecially important line because it involves the 1987 crash low, which was the most dramatic stock market event since the Great Depression. An\nevent of that magnitude will make traders respect any technical pattern associated with it.\nFIGURE PI.2 Market Leaders Often Lead the S&P\n", "text_clean": "to know when a setup is good, and the problem is that trends are constantly creating reversal setups that are almost good enough, but aren’t quite right.

This is what usually happens. The market has been in a trading range since around bar 7, and most attempts to break out of a trading range fail. The market has inertia and tends to continue to do what it has been doing. This also makes most attempts to reverse a trend fail.\nBears see the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top as a lower high and the first pullback in a new bear trend. It is therefore a bear flag. If the market clearly breaks well below the bear flag, whether or not it also breaks below the neckline of the head and shoulders top, and then reverses up and rallies above the top of the right shoulder, the pattern will have failed. The rally will usually reach a measured move target based on the height either of the right shoulder or of the entire head and shoulders top. Some traders see the neckline as a horizontal line drawn across the bottom between the head and the right shoulder (here, the bar 13 low), whereas others see it as the trend channel line drawn across the lows on both sides of the head (bars 9 and 13).\nThe move down to bar 13 had such strong momentum that it will likely be tested, and since the down move was so strong, the test will probably be a lower low. That should trap bears in and bulls out, and then the odds favor the market reversing up in a wedge bull flag. If that is the case, the most likely course from there would be a breakout above bar 11 and a measured move up, but it might take a decade or two before that happens.\nIn the days leading up to the bar 13 crash low, a trader familiar with a dueling lines pattern would have seen the potential for a reversal up, especially after the small final flag from several bars earlier, the consecutive sell climaxes, and the large expanding triangle bull flag (bars 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13).\nIf the market does sell off from a lower high around bar 9, it might find support at the trend line drawn from the bar 1 and bar 4 lows. This is an especially important line because it involves the 1987 crash low, which was the most dramatic stock market event since the Great Depression. An event of that magnitude will make traders respect any technical pattern associated with it.\nFIGURE PI.2 Market Leaders Often Lead the S&P", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["to know when a setup is good, and the problem is that trends are constantly creating reversal setups that are almost good enough, but aren’t quite", "right.

It was a pullback from\nthe bar 9 bear spike and would likely be followed by a second leg down that would test the bar 9 bear spike low. It could then be followed by a bear\nchannel or a trading range.\nBar 11 reversed back up after falling just a little below bar 9, so this was likely the end of a two-legged correction in the prior bull trend. It formed a\ndouble bottom with bar 9. However, this correction broke a major trend line from the bar 2 low, which meant that the market could reverse down\nafter a test of the bar 8 high. Some traders would have used the bull trend line drawn across the bar 4 low to the bar 7 low, and others would have\nused one drawn from the bar 2 low to bar 7 low.\nBar 12 formed a two-legged higher high after a break below a bull trend line. If this were to lead to a trend reversal, the new bear trend should\nhave at least two legs down. It was also a failed breakout above the bars 8 and 10 double top. Whenever a breakout above a double top fails, it is a\nthree-push top. The first two pushes here were the bar 8 and bar 10 tops in the double top. Additionally, it was a small expanding triangle top (bars\n6, 7, 8, 11, and 12).\nThe first leg down to bar 13 was very strong, dropping well below the bars 8 to 11 bull flag. A strong spike usually leads to a measured move, and\nhere there was a leg 1 = leg 2 move down to bar 15 where leg 2 (bar 14 to bar 15) was just a little larger than leg 1 down to bar 13.\nOnce the bar 14 lower high formed, it could be used to create a trend line and then a trend channel line.\nBar 15 reversed up from its breakout of the trend channel line, so it should have two legs up and break above the bear trend line, which it did.\nBar 16 broke below the first bull trend line and reversed up, forming a double bottom bull flag with the higher low from six bars earlier.\nBar 17 was a pullback from the breakout above the bull trend channel line and from the breakout above the double top formed by the two swing\nhighs just before bar 16. This double top was seen by some traders as a wedge top, created by the three small pushes up after the bar 15 low.\nThis rally ended in a small wedge at bar 18, which formed a nominal new high and an expanding triangle top (bars 8, 11, 12, 15, and 18). It was\nalso the top of the bull channel that followed the spike up (the spike just before the bar 17 pullback).\nBar 19 fell below the bull trend line and therefore was a breakout below that trend line. Bar 19 reversed up in an attempt to have the breakout fail.\nThis failed breakout then failed to resume the bull trend, and the rally to bar 20 then became a breakout pullback and a lower high after a break\nbelow the bull trend line. Remember, any failed breakout that fails in its attempt to resume the trend becomes a breakout pullback in the new trend.\nThe bar 20 lower high allowed for the creation of a bear trend line and trend channel line.\nBar 21 fell below a trend channel line and formed a wedge bottom where bar 19 was the first push down. It was also the bottom of a small wedge\nbear channel following the small two-legged spike down from bar 20. It formed a double bottom with bar 15 and a test of the bottom of the trading\nrange that was formed by the bar 2 and bar 15 lows.\nThe rally up to bar 22 broke above the last small high of the bear trend, and it broke above a small double top and above the bear trend line. The\ntest of the bar 22 high failed at bar 23 (it did not go above bar 22), so another down leg was likely.\nBar 24 reversed up after falling below a trend channel line and breaking out of the large trading range. This could have set up a lower trading\nrange, and the chart could have become similar to a trending trading range day on a 5 minute chart. It was almost an exact measured move down\nfrom the bar 20 high to the bar 21 low. Since this bear spike was down so strongly with large bear trend bars, it was a sell climax and it might have\nneeded to correct for two legs sideways to up. The two-legged correction ended at bar 26. A sell climax does not have to lead to a reversal.

The second leg down began at bar 26. This could have\nbeen a setup for a trend reversal or for at least a protracted correction. The breakout down to bar 24 might have been setting up a lower trading\nrange of approximately the same height as the upper trading range between the bar 15 low and the bar 18 high.\nBar 28 was a pullback from the two legs up, but it formed a second higher low, so at least two more legs up were likely. The move from bar 27 to\nbar 28 covered too few bars and too few points to convince enough traders that the correction was over. It also formed a double bottom bull flag\nwith the slightly lower swing low that formed after the bar 27 low.\nBar 29 was the third push in a small wedge, but the spike up from bar 28 was strong enough to make traders wait before shorting aggressively.\nBar 30 was a breakout pullback to a higher high after that small wedge, and it also was the top of a larger wedge where the first push up was the\nhigh before the bar 28 low. It was also the second failed attempt to break back into the upper trading range of the past several months, and\nwhenever the market tries to do something twice and fails both times, it usually tries the opposite. Here, the sell-off led to a breakout below the\nlower trading range’s low at bar 27.\nBar 31 formed a double top bear flag following the break of the bull trend line. Since this was a lower high in a possible resumption of a bear\ntrend, it was a strong short setup.\nBar 32 tested the wedge bear trend channel line, and it was an attempt to form a double bottom bull flag with bar 28 or the higher low just before\nit. The market was likely to either reverse up or collapse. Traders saw bar 32 as a breakout pullback in the attempt to break below bar 28. They\nshorted on a stop at one tick below bar 32 and below the swing low of one bar earlier, which was the low of the wedge.\nBar 33 was a reversal up from a bear trend channel line overshoot, and it led to a small rally above the trend line.

The rally to bar 19 broke above the bear trend line and\nalerted traders to a possible major trend reversal up after a test of the bar 16 low. Bar 20 was the signal bar. The term “major” gives the false\nimpression that something exceptional must be happening, but that is usually not the case. It is a relative term that simply means that a trend is\ntrying to reverse. When each leg has 20 or more bars, as was the case here, traders don’t usually use the term “major trend reversal” and instead\nuse some other description. Traders use terms to describe what is happening on the chart in front of them. If they instead were trading the 15\nminute chart, bar 28 would be a double top major trend down, since it tested the bar 7 bull high after the bar 20 break below the bull trend line.\nConsecutive buy climaxes usually are followed by a protracted correction that has at least two legs. As shown in Figure PI.4, bar 7 in Goldman\nSachs (GS) was about 10 percent above yesterday’s low, capping off a huge two-day bull trend. The spike up from bar 3 to bar 7 was very strong\nand therefore likely to be tested after any pullback. The bar 3 bull spike bar was a buy climax, as was the three-bar spike up from bar 4. The bull\nbodies became progressively smaller in the spike, and this was a sign of a loss of momentum.\nInstead of correcting, however, the market broke out at bar 6 into an accelerated trend, which ended in a four-bar spike up to bar 7. After a third\nconsecutive buy climax, a correction lasting at least 10 bars and having at least two legs was likely. Also, the nine bars up from the bar 2 low all had\nhigher lows and higher highs, and eight of the nine had higher closes. There was also very little overlap between adjacent bars. This was\nunsustainable behavior and therefore climactic, and was therefore likely to correct. Bar 3 was a bull spike, and the move from bar 4 to bar 7 was a\nclimax type of channel in this spike and climax bull trend.\nSince bar 6 broke the trend into an accelerated trend, it was a breakout and therefore traders would be looking for a measuring gap and other\ntypes of measured moves where they would take profits and possibly look for shorts. Bar 6 broke above bar 5, which was the third bar with\nshrinking bodies, and therefore the bodies had a wedge shape and were likely to have some wedge behavior. Once bar 6 closed many ticks\nabove the high of bar 5, it was more likely to be the start of a breakout that would have follow-through over the next several bars. After the next bar\nclosed and its low was above the bar 5 high, bar 6 became a gap and a possible measuring gap. The top of bar 5 was the breakout point for the\nfailed wedge top, and, in the absence of an immediate pullback, the low of the first bar after the breakout was the breakout test. This gap could\nfunction as a measuring gap, and the low of the start of the leg up from bar 4 to the middle of the measuring gap projected up to just below the bar 7\nhigh. There were probably other magnets in this area, with different firms relying on different magnets as signs to take profits or to go short, and the\ncumulative effect was to begin the correction.\nThe market broke the steep trend line when it fell to bar 8. Since the correction should last at least 10 bars, it was a mistake to buy either the high\n1 at bar 8 or the high 2 at bar 10. Both failed, and the market formed a lower high in the form of a double top bear flag at bar 11. Once the market\nbroke out below bar 10, the double top projected down to around the bar 13 low. The move down to bar 13 was so steep that lower prices were\nlikely.\nBar 16 was arguably an acceptable end of a two-legged correction where the first leg down ended at bar 10. It was also below the target of the\nmoving average and it lasted more than 10 bars. This should have been enough to make many traders start to buy for a test of the bar 7 bull trend\nhigh. It was the end of a wedge bull flag where either bar 13 or bar 14 was the first of the three pushes down. Some traders saw bar 13 as the first\nleg and other traders believed that bar 14 was the first leg.\nThe bar 17 breakout of the wedge bull flag was weak and could have been a sign that the correction was not over. Bar 18 was an acceptable\nbreakout pullback long setup, but the breakout of the wedge pulled back again to a lower low at bar 20. This was a lower low after a trend line break\n(the move to bar 19 broke above the bear trend line) and a possible end of a pullback in a larger bull trend. The signal bar had a bull body with a\nclose on its high. The risk/reward ratio was excellent for a long because the bar was only 64 cents high and traders were buying for a test of the\nhigh of the day, which was almost $4.00 higher. Because they were buying at the bottom of a trading range, the probability of success was at least\n60 percent, meaning that they had a 60 percent chance of making $4.00 while risking only 66 cents. This is 2 cents more than the height of the\nsignal bar since they would buy on a stop at one tick above the bar and their protective stop would be one tick below its low. After the strong bull\nspike formed at bar 21, the bulls would have moved their stop to one tick below its low, which was just about breakeven. Although you don’t have to\ncheck other time frames, the first big pullback in a strong trend usually tests the 15 minute moving average. This one was an almost exact test, but\nthat information was not needed to place the trade. As great a price action buy setup as this was, notice how the entry bar was a small bull trend\nbar. The market had not yet realized how good this was. It is natural to become nervous when you take what you think is a great trade in a major\nstock, but no one else sees it as great yet. Sometimes this happens and the market can have several small bars, usually with bull bodies, before\nthe bull reversal is perceived as having taken place. That realization occurred during the big bull trend bar, bar 21. It had great momentum and a\nshaved top and bottom, meaning that the bulls were extremely aggressive and higher prices should follow. The bar 21 bull spike was followed by a\nstrong, tight bull channel up to bar 28, where traders took some profits on the move above the bar 7 high.\nA pullback in a bull trend is a smaller bear trend, as was the correction down to bar 16.

If they instead were trading the 15 chart, bar 28 would be a double top major trend down, since it tested the bar 7 bull high after the\nbar 20 break below the bull trend line, and each leg would be about 10 bars or less on the 15 minute chart, which is not enough for traders to see\nthe legs as new trends.\nFIGURE PI.5 Uncertainty as a Major Trend Reversal Sets Up\nSince markets have inertia and tend to continue what they have been doing, most attempts at reversing a trend fail. Most reasonable major trend\nreversal setups have only a 40 to 50 percent chance of success, except when the setup is especially strong, where the probability of success can\nbe 60 percent or higher. Since there was not much buying pressure today (see Figure PI.5), the selling pressure was strong all the way down to the\nbar 22 two-bar reversal, and the rally to bar 16 was not even enough to flip the always-in position to long, the probability that the bar 22 lower low\nwould lead to a successful reversal was about 40 percent. Simply breaking above a bull trend line and then forming a lower low is not enough to\nhave a high probability of success. The bulls tried to form a double bottom higher low at bar 28, but the setup was weak. Bar 28 had a bear close\nand, although the next bar formed a two-bar reversal, it would have forced bulls to buy at the top of a trading range, which is a low-probability bet\n(the trading range was both the small one from bar 26 and the large one from bar 10).\nAnother problem for the bulls was that the bears had a strong case. Bar 2 was a huge bull trend bar with huge volume (98,000 Emini contracts),\nyet the market could not even get the high of the bar 6 third push up to extend above the bar 5 second push up. The attempt to resume the bull trend\non the open failed at yesterday’s high, and the market reversed down. Once the market broke to the downside at bar 9, traders were looking for\neither a bear trending trading range day or a spike and channel bear trend day. In either case, bar 9 was likely to become a measuring gap and\nlead to a measured move down. The move down to bar 10 had many strong bear trend bars and only three bars with bull bodies, and all three were\nonly one tick tall. Although there were many tails and overlapping bars during the sell-off, the entire move down to bar 10 or bar 14 was strong\nenough for many traders to see it as a bear spike. This made them think that three pushes down and a spike and channel bear trend day were\npossible. They sold below the bar 16 gap bar for the second push down. Traders bought as the market fell below bar 14, which is a sign that the\nbears were not urgently looking to short. Instead of selling at the new low, the bears bought to take profits. The bulls also bought, thinking that bar 22\ncould be the start of a lower low major trend reversal, since the move to bar 16 broke the bear trend line. The bull bodies and the move above the\nmoving average were also signs of strength.\nDuring the rally to bar 25, the bulls had a good argument for the major trend reversal, and wanted a higher low to follow their bar 22 lower low. The\nbear argument for a spike and channel bear trend day and a third push down was still intact. Both the bull and bear cases were valid, which usually\nmeans that the market is in a trading range, which it was. The bulls were hoping that the trading range would become a base and be followed by an\nupside breakout, and the bears saw the trading range as a broad bear channel following the spike on the open down to bar 14. The bears shorted\nagain below bar 25, since the rally was still below the bar 16 pullback from the first push down, and it was a double top with bar 20. Bar 25 went one\ntick above bar 20 and ran some stops, but most bears who were swinging their shorts based on the spike and channel theory would have had their\nstops above the bar 16 pullback from the first push down. They shorted again below the bar 29 low 2. Bar 29 was also a signal bar for a bear\nbreakout of the triangle where the bar before bar 24 was the first push down and bars 26 and 28 were the next two pushes down.\nThe bulls saw bar 28 as a double bottom higher low with bar 26, but were concerned that it had a bear body. Although the next bar was a bull\ntrend bar and a two-bar reversal buy setup, it is rarely good to buy at the top of a trading range (bar 27 was the top of the small trading range). Most\nbulls would have exited below the strong bear reversal bar at bar 29. It was a low 2 sell signal and a failed breakout of the triangle. The bar after bar\n31 was a bull doji and followed three bear bars, and therefore was not a good enough reason for the bulls to buy again. The bull inside bar that\nfollowed bar 32 was a final flag reversal setup from the two-bar final flag that followed bar 31, but the micro channel down from bar 29 was so tight\nthat the probability of success was not high. Although bar 33 was a strong bull breakout from that micro channel, there was no follow-through, and\nthe bulls sold out of their longs either below the bar 33 bear inside bar or one tick below the doji bar that followed. Bulls will sometimes allow one\nbar to go against them, but most would not allow two when the original buy signal was weak and the bar 33 bull breakout did not have any follow-\nthrough.\nBoth the bulls and the bears had swing setups with positive trader’s equations. The bulls who bought above the bar 22 lower low had about a 40\npercent chance of success, with a risk of about two points and a reward of six to 10 points (a measured move up from the breakout above the\ntrading range). The bears who shorted either the bear spike down to bar 14 or below bars 16, 20, or 25 had about a 50 to 60 percent chance of a\nthird push down, with a risk of about a couple of points and a reward of four to six points, and possibly more if there was a bear breakout and\nmeasured move down, instead of simply another bear stair.\nBecause the spike down to bar 14 was weak, many traders anticipated a trading range or a weak bear channel.

The bull bodies and the move above the moving average were also signs of strength.\nDuring the rally to bar 25, the bulls had a good argument for the major trend reversal, and wanted a higher low to follow their bar 22 lower low. The bear argument for a spike and channel bear trend day and a third push down was still intact. Both the bull and bear cases were valid, which usually means that the market is in a trading range, which it was. The bulls were hoping that the trading range would become a base and be followed by an upside breakout, and the bears saw the trading range as a broad bear channel following the spike on the open down to bar 14. The bears shorted again below bar 25, since the rally was still below the bar 16 pullback from the first push down, and it was a double top with bar 20. Bar 25 went one tick above bar 20 and ran some stops, but most bears who were swinging their shorts based on the spike and channel theory would have had their stops above the bar 16 pullback from the first push down. They shorted again below the bar 29 low 2. Bar 29 was also a signal bar for a bear breakout of the triangle where the bar before bar 24 was the first push down and bars 26 and 28 were the next two pushes down.\nThe bulls saw bar 28 as a double bottom higher low with bar 26, but were concerned that it had a bear body. Although the next bar was a bull trend bar and a two-bar reversal buy setup, it is rarely good to buy at the top of a trading range (bar 27 was the top of the small trading range). Most bulls would have exited below the strong bear reversal bar at bar 29. It was a low 2 sell signal and a failed breakout of the triangle. The bar after bar 31 was a bull doji and followed three bear bars, and therefore was not a good enough reason for the bulls to buy again. The bull inside bar that followed bar 32 was a final flag reversal setup from the two-bar final flag that followed bar 31, but the micro channel down from bar 29 was so tight that the probability of success was not high. Although bar 33 was a strong bull breakout from that micro channel, there was no follow-through, and the bulls sold out of their longs either below the bar 33 bear inside bar or one tick below the doji bar that followed. Bulls will sometimes allow one bar to go against them, but most would not allow two when the original buy signal was weak and the bar 33 bull breakout did not have any followthrough.\nBoth the bulls and the bears had swing setups with positive trader’s equations. The bulls who bought above the bar 22 lower low had about a 40 percent chance of success, with a risk of about two points and a reward of six to 10 points (a measured move up from the breakout above the trading range). The bears who shorted either the bear spike down to bar 14 or below bars 16, 20, or 25 had about a 50 to 60 percent chance of a third push down, with a risk of about a couple of points and a reward of four to six points, and possibly more if there was a bear breakout and measured move down, instead of simply another bear stair.\nBecause the spike down to bar 14 was weak, many traders anticipated a trading range or a weak bear channel.

He would usually\ntake just one or two trades a day, and he always wanted to see a strong break beyond the trend line before looking for a reversal entry. For\nexample, in a bull trend like this one, he would not have shorted below bar 3 because there was no prior break of a bull trend line. He would also not\nhave shorted below the bar 7 reversal bar, because there was no prior significant break below a bull trend line. The sell-off below bar 3 lasted only\none bar and did not even reach the moving average.\nThe three bear bars starting at bar 7 broke below the bull trend line, which was a sign of selling pressure, but the sell-off was not strong enough to\nreach the moving average. He would then have studied the rally that would test the bar 7 trend high. It was two-legged, which meant that there was\nsome two-sided trading and therefore the bears showed some strength, and it was the third push up on the day. Since major reversals often occur\nin the first hour or so, he probably would have shorted below bar 11, which was a second entry short, but he probably would not have been\nexpecting a major reversal. Since the day was a spike and channel bull at that point, the sell-off might have just tested the bar 4 start of the bull\nchannel, where the market might have formed a double bottom and then rallied. Because the bull channel was a wedge (it had three pushes), it was\nlikely to have two legs sideways to down. Since my friend is a swing trader, he would have allowed a pullback as long as he believed that his\noriginal premise was still valid. He would therefore have kept his stop above the signal bar, or maybe above the strong bear bar that followed bar\n11, and allowed the pullback to bar 13, expecting a second leg down. If he had not yet shorted, he would have shorted below the bar 13 two-bar\nreversal and lower high major trend reversal, which was a breakout test of the short below bar 11.\nThe two bear bars after bar 11 would have made most traders wonder if the always-in position had flipped to down, and most would have\ndecided that it was indeed down by the end of the five-bar bear spike that ended at bar 14. At this point, if he decided to hold short, he would have\ntightened his protective stop to just above the start of that bear spike that began after bar 13. More likely, he would have bought back most or all of\nhis short position on the move above bar 16, since two legs down had taken place (the move to bar 12 was the first), bar 16 formed a double\nbottom with bars 14 or 15, and it was a third entry for a moving average gap bar long (its high was below the moving average and it was the first\npullback after the strong rally to bar 10). If he bought back his shorts, he would have watched the rally from bar 16 to assess its strength relative to\nthe sell-off to bar 16.

{"book": "REVERSAL", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\reversal3.pdf", "page_index": 43, "text_raw": "The rally from bar 16 to bar 19 had three legs, and was therefore a wedge bear flag. Since it was a rally after a strong break below the bull trend\nline, it was likely to become part of a larger correction with at least one more leg down. The probability was that the market would form either a\ntrading range or a trend reversal. The rally did not contain two consecutive strong bull trend bars, so the bulls were unable to regain control of the\nmarket. Bar 19 formed a double top with bar 13, and since this was now a possible bear trend, that was a double top bear flag, as well as a double\ntop or lower high major trend reversal, when compared to the bar 10 top of the bull trend. Bar 19 was also a bear reversal bar, which is important\nwhen looking for a market top. This was the strongest trend reversal setup of the day, because the bear spike down to bar 14 convinced most\ntraders that the always-in position was short and that the bears owned the market as long as the rally could not get above the top of the bear spike\nthat began after bar 13. Many traders believed that as long as the market could not get above bar 13, the bears were still in control and the market\nmight be forming a lower high in a possible new bear trend. Bears had their protective stops just above bar 13, because they wanted either a\ndouble top or a lower high, and if they got neither, they would exit and wait for another sell signal. Many bulls who bought between bars 10 and 13\nheld their longs through the sell-off to bar 16, to see how strong the bears were. They decided that the selling was strong (it broke the trend line and\nthe moving average, and it lasted for many bars) and that the rally to bar 19 was not strong enough for them to expect the bull trend to make a new\nhigh without at least more of a correction.\nThese were the most determined bulls (since they were willing to hold through the protracted sell-off to bar 16), and once they gave up, there was\nno one left to buy at these prices. The market had to probe lower to find a level where the bulls would return and where the bears would buy back\ntheir shorts. There were no consecutive strong bull trend bars or other signs of strong buying in the move up from bar 16, and this made the bears\nmore aggressive and the bulls less willing to buy. Since the bulls were confident that the market would soon be lower, they used the rally to bar 19 to\nexit their longs around breakeven or with a small loss. The selling by these disappointed bulls, combined with the selling of the aggressive bears\nwho were shorting heavily in an attempt to keep the market from going above bar 13, resulted in the market turning down at bar 19. The bulls were\nwilling to buy again lower, but needed a sign that the market was about to reverse up. The sideways move to bar 23 after seven bars down was not\na strong bottom, so most bulls were unwilling to buy unless the price got marked down further. The bears were willing to take profits at any time, but\nthey would buy back their shorts only if there was a sign of a reasonable bottom. With no sign of a bottom, neither the bulls nor the bears were\nwilling to buy. Also, the remaining longs continued to sell out of their positions, adding to the selling pressure. Bears continued to sell when they saw\nthe increasing selling pressure in the move down from bar 23. The result was a strong trend reversal in the form of the bar 19 lower high after the\nbar 16 break below the bull trend line. As is the case in all strong trends, traders pressed their shorts, adding to their positions as the market\nquickly fell in the spike down to the bar 25 low and down to the bar 28 low, where they began to take profits. All trend bars are spikes, climaxes,\nbreakouts, and gaps. Bar 25 was a large bear breakout bar and was likely going to be followed by a measured move down, based on the height of\nthe trading range. It was possible that bar 25 itself became a measuring gap, with the middle of the gap being the midpoint between the bar 16 low\n(the top of the gap) and the 27 high (the bottom of the gap). This could lead to a measured move down today or tomorrow.\nThe rally to bar 19 was a double top bear flag, a wedge bull flag, and two legs up in a bear trend (the two-legged swing high between bars 15 and\n16 was the first), and it had an excellent trader’s equation. The risk was to above the bar 19 high, or about 10 cents, and the reward at a minimum\nwas 50 cents lower on a test of the bar 16 low, where the market might have formed a double bottom and possibly a large triangle or bull flag. Since\nthe market was in a bear trend or at least at the top of a trading range, the chance of success was at least 60 percent. A 60 percent chance of\nsuccess combined with a 10 cent risk and a 50 cent reward makes for a great trade. A trader who took it 10 times would make $3.00 and lose 40\ncents, an average of 26 cents per trade.\nTraders believed that if the market fell below bar 16, it would probably fall for a measured move down from the double top, which it did. The bar\n16 area was the breakout test of the breakout gap, which was the bull spike from bar 1 to bar 3. After the market rallied from this test, bulls did not\nwant it to fall below the test, because they would have seen that as a sign of weakness. Just like the bears did not want the rally to bar 19 to go\nabove the bar 13 lower high, which could have been followed by a measured move up, the bulls did not want the sell-off from bar 19 to fall below the\nbar 16 higher low, which could have been followed by a measured move down. Since my friend would have seen this move down from bar 19 as a\ntrend trade, he would have traded it like a trend (book 1 discusses how to trade a trend). The initial risk was only 10 cents and the odds were good\nthat the market would have tested the bar 16 low at a minimum, so he would have taken about half off on the test if there was a pause bar. Since\nthere was no pause, there was no significant profit taking, and he probably would not have taken any profits until around bar 28. This was a pause\nafter a sell climax bar that followed a potential final flag (the three bars ending at bar 27). He would have taken maybe half off there with a $1.20\nprofit and held the remainder until a minute or two before the close, for another $1.30 profit.\nIncidentally, remember that both strong bulls and strong bears like to see a large bull trend bar in an overdone bull trend, because it often leads to\na two-legged pullback to below the moving average, as it did here at bar 9. The expected correction provided both of them with a temporary trading\nopportunity, although not a trend reversal trade. Bar 9 was the third consecutive buy climax without much of a pullback (bars 1 to 3 was the first, and\nbars 5 to 6 was the second). It was more likely to become an exhaustion gap than a measuring gap (it was more likely to be the start of a correction\ninstead of a new leg up). In this scenario, both the strong bulls and the strong bears sold at the close of the bar, above its high, at the close of the\nnext bar or two (especially since the bar after bar 10 had a bear body), and below the low of the prior bar. The bulls were selling out of their longs as\nthey took profits, and the bears were selling to put on shorts. Most bears would have picked a protective stop that was less than the number of ticks\nin the bar 9 buy climax bull trend bar. The bulls wouldn’t look to buy again and the bears would not have taken profits on their shorts until after the\ntwo-legged correction was complete, which was in the bar 14 to bar 16 area (the move to bar 12 was the first leg down). The sell-off was strong\nenough for both to think that the market could have a trend reversal into a bear trend after a lower high or higher high test of the bar 10 bull high.\n", "text_clean": "The rally from bar 16 to bar 19 had three legs, and was therefore a wedge bear flag. Since it was a rally after a strong break below the bull trend line, it was likely to become part of a larger correction with at least one more leg down. The probability was that the market would form either a trading range or a trend reversal. The rally did not contain two consecutive strong bull trend bars, so the bulls were unable to regain control of the market. Bar 19 formed a double top with bar 13, and since this was now a possible bear trend, that was a double top bear flag, as well as a double top or lower high major trend reversal, when compared to the bar 10 top of the bull trend. Bar 19 was also a bear reversal bar, which is important when looking for a market top. This was the strongest trend reversal setup of the day, because the bear spike down to bar 14 convinced most traders that the always-in position was short and that the bears owned the market as long as the rally could not get above the top of the bear spike that began after bar 13. Many traders believed that as long as the market could not get above bar 13, the bears were still in control and the market might be forming a lower high in a possible new bear trend. Bears had their protective stops just above bar 13, because they wanted either a double top or a lower high, and if they got neither, they would exit and wait for another sell signal. Many bulls who bought between bars 10 and 13 held their longs through the sell-off to bar 16, to see how strong the bears were. They decided that the selling was strong (it broke the trend line and the moving average, and it lasted for many bars) and that the rally to bar 19 was not strong enough for them to expect the bull trend to make a new high without at least more of a correction.\nThese were the most determined bulls (since they were willing to hold through the protracted sell-off to bar 16), and once they gave up, there was no one left to buy at these prices. The market had to probe lower to find a level where the bulls would return and where the bears would buy back their shorts. There were no consecutive strong bull trend bars or other signs of strong buying in the move up from bar 16, and this made the bears more aggressive and the bulls less willing to buy. Since the bulls were confident that the market would soon be lower, they used the rally to bar 19 to exit their longs around breakeven or with a small loss. The selling by these disappointed bulls, combined with the selling of the aggressive bears who were shorting heavily in an attempt to keep the market from going above bar 13, resulted in the market turning down at bar 19. The bulls were willing to buy again lower, but needed a sign that the market was about to reverse up. The sideways move to bar 23 after seven bars down was not a strong bottom, so most bulls were unwilling to buy unless the price got marked down further. The bears were willing to take profits at any time, but they would buy back their shorts only if there was a sign of a reasonable bottom. With no sign of a bottom, neither the bulls nor the bears were willing to buy. Also, the remaining longs continued to sell out of their positions, adding to the selling pressure. Bears continued to sell when they saw the increasing selling pressure in the move down from bar 23. The result was a strong trend reversal in the form of the bar 19 lower high after the bar 16 break below the bull trend line. As is the case in all strong trends, traders pressed their shorts, adding to their positions as the market quickly fell in the spike down to the bar 25 low and down to the bar 28 low, where they began to take profits. All trend bars are spikes, climaxes, breakouts, and gaps. Bar 25 was a large bear breakout bar and was likely going to be followed by a measured move down, based on the height of the trading range. It was possible that bar 25 itself became a measuring gap, with the middle of the gap being the midpoint between the bar 16 low (the top of the gap) and the 27 high (the bottom of the gap). This could lead to a measured move down today or tomorrow.\nThe rally to bar 19 was a double top bear flag, a wedge bull flag, and two legs up in a bear trend (the two-legged swing high between bars 15 and 16 was the first), and it had an excellent trader’s equation. The risk was to above the bar 19 high, or about 10 cents, and the reward at a minimum was 50 cents lower on a test of the bar 16 low, where the market might have formed a double bottom and possibly a large triangle or bull flag. Since the market was in a bear trend or at least at the top of a trading range, the chance of success was at least 60 percent. A 60 percent chance of success combined with a 10 cent risk and a 50 cent reward makes for a great trade. A trader who took it 10 times would make $3.00 and lose 40 cents, an average of 26 cents per trade.\nTraders believed that if the market fell below bar 16, it would probably fall for a measured move down from the double top, which it did. The bar 16 area was the breakout test of the breakout gap, which was the bull spike from bar 1 to bar 3. After the market rallied from this test, bulls did not want it to fall below the test, because they would have seen that as a sign of weakness. Just like the bears did not want the rally to bar 19 to go above the bar 13 lower high, which could have been followed by a measured move up, the bulls did not want the sell-off from bar 19 to fall below the bar 16 higher low, which could have been followed by a measured move down. Since my friend would have seen this move down from bar 19 as a trend trade, he would have traded it like a trend (book 1 discusses how to trade a trend). The initial risk was only 10 cents and the odds were good that the market would have tested the bar 16 low at a minimum, so he would have taken about half off on the test if there was a pause bar. Since there was no pause, there was no significant profit taking, and he probably would not have taken any profits until around bar 28. This was a pause after a sell climax bar that followed a potential final flag (the three bars ending at bar 27). He would have taken maybe half off there with a $1.20 profit and held the remainder until a minute or two before the close, for another $1.30 profit.\nIncidentally, remember that both strong bulls and strong bears like to see a large bull trend bar in an overdone bull trend, because it often leads to a two-legged pullback to below the moving average, as it did here at bar 9.

They will buy even if the bear spike is huge and strong,\nand goes far below the trend line and the moving average. They hope that their buying will provide the leadership that other traders need to see\nbefore they will also buy. At a minimum, they expect the rally to test the breakout point below the market top.

Most of\ntheir position was profitable because they bought it long ago, far below their last entry. However, since they are buying as the trend continues up,\nthey bought some of their position at the top of the bull and will take a loss when they exit. Once these long-term investing institutions believe that\nthe market is going lower, the trend will reverse, because they were the traders who previously bought every sharp sell-off, and now there is no one\nleft to buy strong bear spikes. They will wait until they believe that the bear trend has reached a long-term value area, which will always be at a long-\nterm support area, like a monthly trend line. Once there, they will buy aggressively again, and they will buy every further attempt by the bears to\nextend the bear trend. At some point, other institutions will see the support forming and they will also buy. There will soon be a strong bull spike, a\npullback that tests the bear low, and then a reversal into a new bull trend.\nEvery reversal pattern is some kind of trading range, and therefore has two-sided trading until it is clear that the countertrend traders have gained\ncontrol. The term major trend reversal means different things to different traders, and no one can say with certainty that the trend has reversed until\nthe move has gone on for at least enough bars for the always-in position to change direction in the eyes of most traders. However, that alone is not\nenough for a reversal to be labeled “major.” The always-in position changes with every tradable swing on the 5 minute chart for many traders, which\nmeans that it changes many times a day on most days, even though the dominant trend usually remains the same. A major trend reversal means\nthat there are two trends on the chart in front of you, with a reversal in between them where either a bull trend has reversed into a bear trend or a\nbear trend has reversed into a bull trend. This type of reversal is different from the many up and down reversals on the chart that usually move far\nenough for a trade, but not far enough to change the direction of the major trend. Also, those minor reversals happen whether or not there is an\nobvious trend on the screen.\nThe earliest signals for most major trend reversals have a low probability of success, but offer the largest reward, often many times greater than\nthe risk. The market is often mostly sideways at the outset, with many pullbacks, but if the trend is actually reversing, the new trend will soon be\nobvious. Many traders prefer to wait to enter until the trend is clear. These traders prefer to only take trades with at least a 60 percent chance of\nsuccess and are willing to make less (they are entering after the move has already begun) on the trade for the increased chance of success. Since\nboth approaches have positive trader’s equations when done properly, both are reasonable.\nFour things are needed for a major trend reversal:\n1. A trend on the chart in front of you.\n2. A countertrend move (a reversal) that is strong enough to break the trend line and usually the moving average.\n3. A test of the trend’s extreme, and then a second reversal (a higher high, a double top, or a lower high at the top of a bull trend, or a lower low, a\ndouble bottom, or a higher low at the bottom of a bear trend).\n4. The second reversal going far enough for there to be a consensus that the trend has reversed.\nFirst, there has to be a trend on the screen in front of you, and then a countertrend move that is strong enough to break the major trend’s trend\nline, and preferably convincingly beyond the moving average. Next, the trend has to resume and test the old trend’s extreme, and then the market\nhas to reverse again. For example, after there is a strong move down below the bull trend line in a bull trend, traders will watch the next rally. If the\nmarket turns down again in the area of the old high (from a lower high, double top, or higher high), the test was successful and traders will begin to\nsuspect that the trend is reversing. Finally, the move down has to be strong enough for traders to believe that the market is in a bear trend. If the\nmove down is in the form of a strong bear spike composed of many consecutive large bear trend bars, everyone will see the market as now being\nin a bear trend. However, the market will instead often be in a broad bear channel for 50 or more bars, without enough clarity to convince traders\nthat the trend has truly reversed to down. They may wonder if it instead has evolved into a large trading range, which will often be the case. In the\nabsence of a very strong bear spike, there will not be strong agreement that the trend has reversed until after dozens of bars and a series of lower\nhighs and lows. At this point, the market can be far below the old bull high and there might not be much more left to the bear trend.\nIt does not matter that agreement about the reversal often does not come until long after the market has actually reversed, because there will be\ntrades all the way down. If the move down is unclear and two-sided, traders will trade it like any other two-sided market and take trades in both\ndirections. If it is a very strong bear trend, traders will almost exclusively take shorts. If there are trades all the way down, then why should a trader\never think about a major trend reversal? Because the trader’s equation is excellent if a trader enters early, just as the market is turning down from\nits test of the old high. The reward is often many times larger than the risk, and even if the probability is only 40 to 50 percent, the result is a very\nfavorable trader’s equation. Most lead to trading ranges, but still profitable trades.\nVirtually all major trend reversals begin with either a trend line break or a trend channel line overshoot and reversal, and all of those eventually\nbreak the trend line when there is a reversal. For example, if a bull market is ending in a head and shoulders top, the move down from the head\nusually breaks below the bull trend line for the entire bull trend, and always below the smaller bull trend line along the bottom of the bars that rally up\nto form the head. The bulls buy when the sell-off from the head reaches the area of the pullback from the left shoulder, trying to create a double\nbottom bull flag. Many bears, who shorted as the rally to the head moved above the left shoulder, take profits in the same area, in case the market\nenters a trading range or forms a double bottom bull flag. The bears see the rally that creates the right shoulder as a lower high breakout pullback\nshort setup, and short. The trend line break is what a bear needs to see before feeling confident about taking a countertrend position (a short in a\nbull trend), because it signifies a break of the trend and the start of a possible major trend reversal. Also, bulls who bought at the prior high (the\nhead), expecting another leg up, and held on to their positions watch the strength of the sell-off from the head. Once they see that it was strong\nenough to fall below the trend line, they will use the rally to exit their longs with a small loss. The selling by both the bulls and the bears causes the\nmarket to drop and form the lower high (the right shoulder).

If it is strong, the bears will no longer simply scalp out of their shorts, thinking that the market is still in a trading\nrange. Instead, they will hold on to their shorts and even sell more, expecting a major trend reversal, especially on and after the breakout below the\nneckline. The bulls will see the strength of the selling and will not be willing to buy until the market stabilizes, which they expect will be at least\nseveral bars later, and possibly after a measured move down.\nIf, in contrast, the sell-off from the head to the neckline is weak, both the bulls and the bears will buy on the test of the neckline. The bulls will buy\nbecause they see the entire pattern as a trading range in a bull trend and therefore just a large bull flag. They are buying what they expect is the\nbottom of the bull flag, where there is an approximate triple bottom (the three reversals up from the neckline). Some bulls will scalp out as the\nmarket tests toward the middle or top of the trading range, and others will hold, looking for a bull breakout and a swing up. The bears will buy back\ntheir shorts and not look to sell again until they can get a better price. They hope that the bounce stays below the right shoulder, and if it does or if it\nforms a double top with the right shoulder, they will short again, hoping that the pattern becomes a head and shoulders top with two right shoulders,\nwhich is common. If the market breaks above the right shoulder, they will buy back their shorts and not look to sell again for many bars, concluding\nthat the entire pattern evolved into a large bull flag and that the breakout will likely rally for at least a measured move up. The bulls will also buy the\nbreakout above the right shoulder, knowing that the bears will cover their shorts and not look to sell again for many bars. They, like the bears, will\nexpect an approximate measured move up, and will buy more as the new bull leg progresses.\nThe same is true of a double top or a higher high. Whenever the market returns to the area of a prior high after having a sharp sell-off, the bulls\nwho bought at the old high become disappointed by that sell-off and use the rally to exit their longs. This means that they become sellers (they sell\nout of their longs), and they won’t buy again until prices get marked down considerably. With no one left to buy at the current prices and both the\nbulls and bears selling, the market falls.\nThe same happens at a market bottom. Once there is a rally that is strong enough to break above the bear trend line (either the trend line for the\nentire bear trend or simply the one above the sell-off to the head), the bears who shorted at the bottom as the market broke below the left shoulder,\nexpecting another leg down, will be disappointed by the rally and will expect at least another leg up after a test down. Traders will see the next leg\ndown as a test of the strength of the bear trend. If the bear trend is strong, the market will eventually break below the old low (the head) by many\nbars and have another leg down. If the trend is reversing, aggressive bulls will buy around the old low, and the bears who shorted at the old low will\nbe disappointed by the strong rally from the head and the weaker move down to test the bear low, and will use this dip to buy back their shorts\naround breakeven. With both the bulls and the bears buying, and the bears unwilling to sell again around this level, the market will rally. This test can\nform a perfect double bottom with the old bear low, a higher low, or a lower low. It does not matter, because they are all manifestations of the same\nprocess. If it forms a higher low, some traders will see it as a right shoulder of a head and shoulders bottom, and will look for a reasonable left\nshoulder. If they find one, they will be more confident that this is a trend reversal because they believe that many traders will recognize the pattern\nand begin to buy. However, whether there is a clear left shoulder is irrelevant to most traders. The important point is that there is the strong break\nabove the bear trend line, followed by a test of the bear low, and then by a reversal up into a bull swing or trend.\nWhether a top comes from a higher high, a perfect double top, or a lower high is irrelevant, because they all represent the same behavior. The\nmarket is testing the old high to see if there will be mostly buyers and a bull breakout, or mostly sellers and a bear reversal. There are two pushes\nup to the top: the first is the original bull high, and the second is the test of that high after the market has fallen below the bull trend line. The market\ndoes not care how perfect the double top is; regardless of their appearance, all of the tests should be thought of as variations of double tops. The\nsame is true of market bottoms. There is a market low and then a rally that is usually strong enough to break above the bear trend line. That low is\nthe first bottom of the double bottom. After the market breaks above the bear trend line (and therefore out of the bear channel) and sells off again to\ntest the first bottom, when the market reverses up, this low is the second bottom of the double bottom, whether it is above, exactly at, or below the\nfirst bottom.\nThe relationship between traditional double tops and bottoms and their micro versions on higher time frame charts is the same as it is for all\nmicro patterns. For example, if a trader sees a double bottom on a 5 minute chart and then looks at a higher time frame chart, the two bottoms will\nbe just two or three bars apart, creating a micro double bottom. Similarly, if a trader looks at a micro double bottom on the 5 minute chart where the\ntwo bottoms are just two or three bars apart, this bottom would be a perfect trend reversal on a small-enough time frame chart, where the rally after\nthe first bottom broke above the bear trend line, and the second bottom is the test. In fact, most tradable reversals on every chart, even small\nscalps, begin with a micro double bottom or top, and most traders will not place the reversal trade unless one is present. A micro double top is a\nfailed breakout in a bull trend, and therefore either a failed high 1, high 2, or triangle buy signal, and a failed double bottom is a failed low 1, low 2,\nor triangle sell signal. This means that these reversals are small final flag reversals (discussed in Chapter 7). In fact, a final flag is a variation of a\ndouble top or bottom. For example, it there is a two-legged rally on a trading range day and the market then forms an ii pattern, traders will be alert\nto a possible final flag breakout and reversal down. The spike that formed just before the ii pattern is the first push up, and the small bull breakout is\nthe second. Since that is two pushes up, even though the highs are not at the same level, it is just a variation of a double top.\nTraders anticipating a reversal down will short at and above the high of the signal bar for the breakout of what they anticipate will be the final bull\nflag. When it is a micro pattern, their limit orders to short will be at and just above the high of the signal bar. When it is a larger pattern, it will be a\nmicro pattern on a higher time frame chart, and some traders will have their limit orders at and above that higher time frame signal bar. Other\ntraders, and probably many institutions, will scale into shorts as the market moves out of what they believe will be the final bull flag. They do the\nopposite at market bottoms with a double bottom or micro double bottom that they expect will become the final flag of the bear leg and lead to a\nreversal up.\nRemember, all trends are in channels, and until there is a strong breakout of the channel, the best bet is against any attempt to break out beyond\nthe trend line. Until there is a strong break beyond the trend line, most traders will view any countertrend trade as only a scalp. In the absence of a\ntrend line break, there is still a strong trend in effect and traders should make sure that they take every with-trend entry and do not worry about\nmissing an occasional countertrend scalp. The best odds and the most money are with the with-trend trades. True V bottoms and tops in the\nabsence of trend channel line overshoots and reversals are so rare that they are not worth considering. Traders should focus on common patterns,\nand if they miss an occasional rare event, there will always be a pullback where they can start trading with the new trend.\nThe trend line break does not reverse the trend. It is simply the first significant sign that countertrend traders are getting strong enough that you\nshould soon begin to trade in their direction. However, you first should continue to trade with the trend because after the break of the trend line there\nwill be a test of the old trend extreme. The test can slightly overshoot or undershoot the old extreme. You should take a countertrend trade only if a\nreversal setup develops during this test. If it does, the countertrend move should form at least two legs, and it might even result in a new, opposite\ntrend.\nA move above a prior high in a bull trend will generally lead to one of three outcomes: more buying, profit taking, or shorting. When the trend is\n", "text_clean": "bottom of the pattern, along the lowest points of the sell-offs from the left shoulder, head, and finally right shoulder), both the bulls and the bears will assess the strength of the sell-off.

They hope that the bounce stays below the right shoulder, and if it does or if it forms a double top with the right shoulder, they will short again, hoping that the pattern becomes a head and shoulders top with two right shoulders, which is common. If the market breaks above the right shoulder, they will buy back their shorts and not look to sell again for many bars, concluding that the entire pattern evolved into a large bull flag and that the breakout will likely rally for at least a measured move up. The bulls will also buy the breakout above the right shoulder, knowing that the bears will cover their shorts and not look to sell again for many bars. They, like the bears, will expect an approximate measured move up, and will buy more as the new bull leg progresses.\nThe same is true of a double top or a higher high. Whenever the market returns to the area of a prior high after having a sharp sell-off, the bulls who bought at the old high become disappointed by that sell-off and use the rally to exit their longs. This means that they become sellers (they sell out of their longs), and they won’t buy again until prices get marked down considerably. With no one left to buy at the current prices and both the bulls and bears selling, the market falls.\nThe same happens at a market bottom. Once there is a rally that is strong enough to break above the bear trend line (either the trend line for the entire bear trend or simply the one above the sell-off to the head), the bears who shorted at the bottom as the market broke below the left shoulder, expecting another leg down, will be disappointed by the rally and will expect at least another leg up after a test down. Traders will see the next leg down as a test of the strength of the bear trend. If the bear trend is strong, the market will eventually break below the old low (the head) by many bars and have another leg down. If the trend is reversing, aggressive bulls will buy around the old low, and the bears who shorted at the old low will be disappointed by the strong rally from the head and the weaker move down to test the bear low, and will use this dip to buy back their shorts around breakeven. With both the bulls and the bears buying, and the bears unwilling to sell again around this level, the market will rally. This test can form a perfect double bottom with the old bear low, a higher low, or a lower low. It does not matter, because they are all manifestations of the same process. If it forms a higher low, some traders will see it as a right shoulder of a head and shoulders bottom, and will look for a reasonable left shoulder. If they find one, they will be more confident that this is a trend reversal because they believe that many traders will recognize the pattern and begin to buy. However, whether there is a clear left shoulder is irrelevant to most traders. The important point is that there is the strong break above the bear trend line, followed by a test of the bear low, and then by a reversal up into a bull swing or trend.\nWhether a top comes from a higher high, a perfect double top, or a lower high is irrelevant, because they all represent the same behavior. The market is testing the old high to see if there will be mostly buyers and a bull breakout, or mostly sellers and a bear reversal. There are two pushes up to the top: the first is the original bull high, and the second is the test of that high after the market has fallen below the bull trend line. The market does not care how perfect the double top is; regardless of their appearance, all of the tests should be thought of as variations of double tops. The same is true of market bottoms. There is a market low and then a rally that is usually strong enough to break above the bear trend line. That low is the first bottom of the double bottom. After the market breaks above the bear trend line (and therefore out of the bear channel) and sells off again to test the first bottom, when the market reverses up, this low is the second bottom of the double bottom, whether it is above, exactly at, or below the first bottom.\nThe relationship between traditional double tops and bottoms and their micro versions on higher time frame charts is the same as it is for all micro patterns. For example, if a trader sees a double bottom on a 5 minute chart and then looks at a higher time frame chart, the two bottoms will be just two or three bars apart, creating a micro double bottom. Similarly, if a trader looks at a micro double bottom on the 5 minute chart where the two bottoms are just two or three bars apart, this bottom would be a perfect trend reversal on a small-enough time frame chart, where the rally after the first bottom broke above the bear trend line, and the second bottom is the test. In fact, most tradable reversals on every chart, even small scalps, begin with a micro double bottom or top, and most traders will not place the reversal trade unless one is present. A micro double top is a failed breakout in a bull trend, and therefore either a failed high 1, high 2, or triangle buy signal, and a failed double bottom is a failed low 1, low 2, or triangle sell signal. This means that these reversals are small final flag reversals (discussed in Chapter 7). In fact, a final flag is a variation of a double top or bottom. For example, it there is a two-legged rally on a trading range day and the market then forms an ii pattern, traders will be alert to a possible final flag breakout and reversal down. The spike that formed just before the ii pattern is the first push up, and the small bull breakout is the second. Since that is two pushes up, even though the highs are not at the same level, it is just a variation of a double top.\nTraders anticipating a reversal down will short at and above the high of the signal bar for the breakout of what they anticipate will be the final bull flag. When it is a micro pattern, their limit orders to short will be at and just above the high of the signal bar. When it is a larger pattern, it will be a micro pattern on a higher time frame chart, and some traders will have their limit orders at and above that higher time frame signal bar. Other traders, and probably many institutions, will scale into shorts as the market moves out of what they believe will be the final bull flag. They do the opposite at market bottoms with a double bottom or micro double bottom that they expect will become the final flag of the bear leg and lead to a reversal up.\nRemember, all trends are in channels, and until there is a strong breakout of the channel, the best bet is against any attempt to break out beyond the trend line. Until there is a strong break beyond the trend line, most traders will view any countertrend trade as only a scalp. In the absence of a trend line break, there is still a strong trend in effect and traders should make sure that they take every with-trend entry and do not worry about missing an occasional countertrend scalp. The best odds and the most money are with the with-trend trades. True V bottoms and tops in the absence of trend channel line overshoots and reversals are so rare that they are not worth considering. Traders should focus on common patterns, and if they miss an occasional rare event, there will always be a pullback where they can start trading with the new trend.\nThe trend line break does not reverse the trend. It is simply the first significant sign that countertrend traders are getting strong enough that you should soon begin to trade in their direction. However, you first should continue to trade with the trend because after the break of the trend line there will be a test of the old trend extreme. The test can slightly overshoot or undershoot the old extreme. You should take a countertrend trade only if a reversal setup develops during this test. If it does, the countertrend move should form at least two legs, and it might even result in a new, opposite trend.\nA move above a prior high in a bull trend will generally lead to one of three outcomes: more buying, profit taking, or shorting.

If the\nmarket goes up far enough above the breakout to enable a trader to make at least a profitable scalp before there is a pullback, then assume that\nthere was mostly new buying at the high. If it goes sideways, assume that there was profit taking and that the bulls are looking to buy again a little\nlower. If the market reverses down hard, assume that the strong bears dominated at the new high and that the market will likely trade down for at\nleast a couple of legs and at least 10 bars.\nSome traders like to enter on the earliest sign that a trend is reversing, such as when it is breaking out of the channel. However, this is a low-\nprobability style of trading. Yes, the large reward can offset the risk and low probability of success, but most traders end up cherry-picking and\ninvariably talking themselves out of the best cherries. As with all breakouts, it is usually better to wait to see how strong the breakout is. If it is strong,\nthen look to enter on the pullback. This concept applies to reversals from all trends, even small trends, like pullbacks in larger trends, micro\nchannels, channels after spikes, and trends that are in broad channels. If the countertrend breakout is weak, look to enter in the direction of the\ntrend as the reversal attempt fails. If the breakout is very strong and goes for many bars without a pullback, then treat it like any strong breakout and\nenter the new trend at the market or on a small pullback, as was discussed in Part I of the second book.\nIn the absence of some rare, dramatic news event, traders don’t suddenly switch from extremely bullish to extremely bearish. There is a gradual\ntransition. A trader becomes less bullish, then neutral, and then bearish. Once enough traders make this transition, the market reverses into a\ndeeper correction or into a bear trend. Every firm has its own measure of excess, and at some point, enough firms decide that the trend has gone\ntoo far. They believe that there is little risk of missing a great move up if they stop buying above the old high, and they will buy only on pullbacks. If\nthe market hesitates above the old high, the market is becoming two-sided, and the strong bulls are using the new high to take profits.\nProfit taking means that traders are still bullish and are looking to buy a pullback. Most new highs are followed by profit taking. Every new high is\na potential top, but most reversal attempts fail and become the beginning of bull flags, only to be followed by another new high. If a rally to test the\nhigh has several small pullbacks within the leg up, with lots of overlapping bars, several bear bodies, and big tails on the tops of the bars, and most\nof the bull trend bars are weak, then the market is becoming increasingly two-sided. The bulls are taking profits at the tops of the bars and buying\nonly at the bottoms of the bars, and the bears are beginning to short at the tops of the bars. Similarly, the bulls are taking profits as the market\napproaches the top of the bull trend and the bears are shorting more. If the market goes above the bull high, it is likely that the profit taking and\nshorting will be even stronger, and a trading range or reversal will form.\nMost traders do not like to reverse, so if they are anticipating a reversal signal, they prefer to exit their longs and then wait for that signal. The loss\nof these bulls on the final leg up in the trend contributes to the weakness of the rally to the final high. If there is a strong reversal down after the\nmarket breaks above the prior high, the strong bears are taking control of the market, at least for the near term. Once that happens, then the bulls\nwho were hoping to buy a small pullback believe instead that the market will fall further. They therefore wait to buy until there is a much larger\npullback, and their absence from buying allows the bears to drive the market down into a deeper correction, lasting 10 or more bars and often\nhaving two or more legs.\nThere is one situation where the breakout in a bull trend is routinely met by aggressive shorts who will usually take over the market. A pullback is\na minor trend in the opposite direction, and traders expect it to end soon and for the larger trend to resume. When there is a pullback in a strong\nbear trend, the market will often have two legs up in the minor bull trend. As the market goes above the high of the first leg up, it is breaking out\nabove a prior swing high in a minor bull trend. However, since most traders will see the move up as a pullback that will end very soon, the dominant\ntraders on the breakout will usually be aggressive sellers, instead of aggressive new buyers, or profit-taking longs, and the minor bull trend will\nusually reverse back down into the direction of the major bear trend after breaking out above the first or second swing high in the pullback.\nThe same is true of new lows in a bear trend. When the bear trend is strong, strong bears will press their positions on the breakout to a new low\nby shorting more, and the market will continue to fall until it reaches some measured move target. As the trend weakens, the price action at a new\nlow will be less clear, which means that the strong bears are using the new low as an area to take profits on their shorts rather than as an area to\nadd to their shorts. As the bear trend further loses strength, eventually the strong bulls will see a new low as a great price to initiate longs and they\nwill be able to create a reversal pattern and then a significant rally.\nAs a trend matures, it usually transitions into a trading range, but the first trading ranges that form are usually followed by a continuation of the\ntrend. How do the strong bulls and bears act as a trend matures? In a bull trend, when the trend is strong, the pullbacks are small because the\nstrong bulls want to buy more on a pullback. Since they suspect that there may not be a pullback until the market is much higher, they begin to buy in\npieces, but relentlessly. They look for any reason to buy and, with so many big traders in the market, there will be some buying for every imaginable\nreason. They place limit orders to buy a few ticks down and other limit orders to buy a few ticks above the low of the prior bar, at the low of the prior\nbar, and below the low of the prior bar. They place stop orders to buy above the high of the prior bar and on a breakout above any prior swing high.\nThey also buy on the close of both any bull or bear trend bar. They see the bear trend bar as a brief opportunity to buy at a better price and the bull\ntrend bar as a sign that the market is about to move up quickly.\nThe strong bears are smart, and they see what is going on. Since they believe, just like the strong bulls, that the market is going to be higher\nbefore long, it does not make sense for them to be shorting. They just step aside and wait until they can sell higher. How much higher? Each\ninstitution has its own measure of excess, but once the market gets to a price level where enough bear firms believe that it might not go any higher,\nthey will begin to short. If enough of them short around the same price level, more and larger bear trend bars form and bars start to get tails on the\ntops. These are signs of selling pressure and they tell all traders that the bulls are becoming weaker and the bears are becoming stronger. The\nstrong bulls eventually stop buying above the last swing high and instead begin to take profits as the market goes to a new high. They are still\nbullish, but are becoming selective and will buy only on pullbacks. As the two-sided trading increases and the sell-offs have more bear trend bars\nand last for more bars, the strong bulls will want to buy only at the bottom of the developing trading range and will look to take profits at the top. The\nstrong bears begin to short at new highs and are now willing to scale in higher. They might take partial profits near the bottom of the developing\ntrading range if they think that the market might reverse back up and break out to a new high, but they will keep looking to short new highs. At some\npoint, the market becomes a 50–50 market and neither the bulls nor the bears are in control; eventually the bears become dominant, a bear trend\nbegins, and the opposite process unfolds.\nA protracted trend will often have an unusually strong breakout, but it can be an exhaustive climax. For example, in a protracted bull trend, all\nstrong bulls and bears love to see a large bull trend bar or two, especially if it is exceptionally big, because they expect it to be a brief, unusually\ngreat opportunity. Once the market is close to where the strong bulls and bears want to sell, like near a measured move target or a trend channel\nline, especially if the move is the second or third consecutive buy climax, they step aside. The absence of selling by the strongest traders results in\na vacuum above the market, which creates one or two relatively large bull trend bars. This bull spike is just the sign that the strong traders have\nbeen waiting for, and once it is there, they appear as if out of nowhere and begin their selling. The bulls take profits on their longs and the bears\ninitiate new shorts, both betting against the breakout. Both sell aggressively at the close of the bar, above its high, at the close of the next bar\n", "text_clean": "strong, strong bulls will press their longs by buying the breakout above the old high and there will be a measured move up of some kind.

The weak bears, who shorted early and maybe scaled in, were terrified by the rapidity with which the bar broke to a new high. They\nare afraid of relentless follow-through buying, so they buy back their shorts. These weak traders are trading on emotion and are competing against\ncomputers, which do not have emotion as one of the variables in their algorithms. Since the computers control the market, the emotions of the weak\ntraders doom them to big losses on big bull trend bars at the end of an overdone bull trend. The market is reversing, not successfully breaking out.\nOnce a strong bull trend begins to have pullbacks that are relatively large, the pullbacks, which are always small trading ranges, behave more like\ntrading ranges than bull flags. The direction of the breakout becomes less certain, and traders begin to think that a downside breakout is about as\nlikely as an upside breakout. A new high is now a breakout attempt above a trading range, and the odds are that it will fail. Likewise, once a strong\nbear trend begins to have relatively large pullbacks, those pullbacks behave more like trading ranges than like bear flags; therefore, a new low is an\nattempt to break below a trading range, and the odds are that it will fail, and that the trading range will continue.\nEvery trading range is within either a bull trend or a bear trend. Once the two-sided trading is strong enough to create the trading range, the trend\nis no longer strong, at least while the trading range is in effect. There will always eventually be a breakout from the range, and if it is to the upside\nand it is very strong, the market is in a strong bull trend. If it is to the downside and strong, the market is in a strong bear trend.\nOnce the bears are strong enough to push a pullback well below the bull trend line and the moving average, they are confident enough that the\nmarket will likely not go much higher and they will aggressively short above the old high. At this point, the bulls will have decided that they should buy\nonly a deep pullback. A new mind-set is now dominant at the new high. It is no longer a place to buy because it no longer represents much strength.\nYes, there is profit taking by the bulls, but most big traders now look at the new high as a great opportunity to initiate shorts. The market has\nreached the tipping point, and most traders have stopped looking to buy small pullbacks and instead are looking to sell rallies. The bears are\ndominant, and the strong selling will likely lead to a large correction or even a trend reversal. After the next strong push down, the bears will look for\na lower high to sell again or to add to their short positions, and the bulls who bought the pullback will become concerned that the trend might have\nreversed or at least that there will be a much larger pullback. Instead of hoping for a new bull high to take profits on their longs, they will now take\nprofits at a lower high and not look to buy again until after a larger correction. Bulls know that most reversal attempts fail, and many who rode the\ntrend up will not exit their longs until after the bears have demonstrated the ability to push the market down hard. Once these bulls see this\nimpressive selling pressure, they will then look for a rally to finally exit their longs. Their supply will limit the rally, and their selling, added to the\nshorting by aggressive bears and the profit taking by bulls who saw the sell-off as a buying opportunity, will create a second leg down.\nIf the market enters a bear trend, the process will reverse. When the bear trend is strong, traders will short below prior lows. As the trend\nweakens, the bears will take profits at new lows and the market will likely enter a trading range. After a strong rally above the bull trend line and the\nmoving average, the bears will take profits at a new low and strong bulls will aggressively buy and try to take control of the market. The result will be\na larger bear rally or possibly a reversal into a bull trend.\nA similar situation occurs when there is a pullback that is large enough to make traders wonder if the trend has reversed. For example, if there is\na deep, sharp pullback in a bull trend, traders will begin to think the market may have reversed. They are looking at moves below prior swing lows,\nbut this is in the context of a pullback in a bull trend instead of as part of a bear trend. They will watch what happens as the market falls below a prior\nswing low. Will the market fall far enough for bears, who entered on a sell stop below that swing low, to make a profit? Did the new low find more\nsellers than buyers? If it did, that is a sign that the bears are strong and that the pullback will probably fall further. The trend might even have\nreversed to down.\nAnother possibility on the breakout to a new low is that the market enters a trading range, which is evidence that the shorts took profits and that\nthere was unimpressive buying by the bulls. The final alternative is that the market reverses up after the breakout to a new low. This means that\nthere were strong bulls below that swing low just waiting for the market to test there. This is a sign that the sell-off is more likely just a big pullback in\nan ongoing bull trend. The shorts from higher up took profits on the breakout to the new low because they believed that the trend was still up. The\nstrong bulls bought aggressively because they believed that the market would not fall further and that it would rally to test the bull high.\nWhenever there is any breakout below a swing low, traders will watch carefully for evidence that the bulls have returned or that the bears have\ntaken control. They need to decide what influence is greatest at the new low, and they use the market’s behavior to make that decision. If there is a\nstrong breakout, then new selling is dominant. If the market’s movement is uncertain, then profit taking by the shorts and weak buying by the bulls is\ntaking place, and the market will likely enter a trading range. If there is a strong reversal up, then aggressive buying by the longs is the most\nimportant factor.\nStrong trend channel line reversals are from greatly overextended trends and often run far after they reverse through the channel to the opposite\nside and then break the trend line. The first pullback after the reversal is often shallow because the market is emotional and everyone quickly\nagrees that the trend has reversed. Because of the confidence, traders will be much more aggressive and will add on during the smallest pause\nand not take profits, keeping the pullbacks small.\nWhen there is a strong break of a trend line, there will usually be a second leg after a pullback. The pullback often retraces and tests the old trend\nline, but there are almost always more reliable price action reasons for entering there in your attempt to catch the second leg of the pullback or new\ntrend. The stronger the move through the trend line, the more likely it is that there will be a second leg after a pullback. If the break of the trend line is\nnot even strong enough to reach the moving average, it is usually not strong enough to reverse the trend, so do not begin looking for a trend reversal\njust yet. The trend is still strong and you should take only with-trend setups, despite the break of the trend line.\nTrends end with a reversal, which is a countertrend move that breaks the trend line, and then a test of the final trend extreme. The test may\novershoot the old extreme as in the case of a lower low in a new bull trend or a higher high in a new bear trend, or it may undershoot it with a higher\nlow in a new bull trend or a lower high in a new bear trend. Rarely, the test will form a perfect double top or double bottom to the exact tick.\nOvershoots are, strictly speaking, the final leg of the old trend, because they form the most extreme price in the trend. An undershoot is the pullback\nfrom the first leg in the new trend. Tests themselves are frequently made of two legs (for example, like a two-legged rally after a bear breakout).\nIf the overshoot goes too far and is in too tight a channel, you should not be looking for a reversal. The trend has likely resumed and is not in the\nprocess of reversing. Instead, begin the process over and wait for another trend line break and then another test of the trend’s extreme before\nlooking for a reversal trade.\nThe test of the trend extreme is usually in the form of some type of channel, and the strength of the channel is especially important when the\n", "text_clean": "(especially if it is a weaker bar), and at the close of the following bar, especially if the bars are starting to have bear bodies.

For example, if there is a strong bull trend and then there is a strong sell-off that breaks well below the\nbull trend line, traders will study the next rally carefully. They want to see whether that rally will simply be a test of the bull high or instead it will break\nout strongly above the high and be followed by another strong leg up in the bull trend. One of the most important considerations is the momentum of\nthat test of the bull high. If the rally is in a very tight, steep channel with no pullbacks and very little overlap between consecutive bars, and the rally\ngoes far above the bull high before having any pause or pullback, the momentum is strong and the odds are increased that the bull trend will\nresume, despite that earlier strong sell-off and breakout below the bull trend line. In contrast, if the rally has many overlapping bars, several large\nbear trend bars, two or three clear pullbacks, maybe a wedge shape, and a slope that is noticeably less than the slope of the original bull trend and\nof the sell-off, then the odds are that the test of the bull high will result in either a lower high or a slightly higher high and then another attempt to sell\noff. The market might be reversing into a bear trend, but at a minimum, a trading range is likely.\nMarkets have inertia and tend to continue to do what they have been doing. This causes most trend reversals to fail. Also, when one succeeds in\nreversing the market, a trading range is more likely to form than a trend in the opposite direction, since a trading range represents less change. In a\ntrading range, traders from the old trend are still strong, but are balanced by traders from the opposite trend. This is more likely than the market\nquickly changing control from one set of trend traders to trend traders in the opposite direction. However, even if a trading range forms, it usually will\nhave large, tradable countertrend swings and it might take dozens of bars before traders know whether the market has reversed into an opposite\ntrend or instead has been forming a large flag in an ongoing trend.\nSince the countertrend move after a trend line break usually has at least two legs, if a bull reversal has a higher low for the test of the bear low, it\nwill also be the start of the second leg. However, if it forms a lower low for the test, that low will be the start of the first leg; after that first leg, it is likely\nthat there will be a pullback and then a second leg. Likewise, in a bear reversal, a lower high is the start of the second leg, but a higher high test is\nthe start of the first leg.\nEverything is relative to the chart in front of you and looks different on higher and smaller time frame charts. If the legs that break off the trend line\nand test the trend’s extreme have only two bars on a 5 minute chart, traders will not see this as a major trend reversal, although those legs might\nhave about 10 bars on a 1 minute chart and create an excellent major trend reversal setup. Similarly, if a bull trend that has lasted 60 bars has a\npullback and a test where the legs have 20 or more bars, they might create a major trend reversal setup on the 15 minute chart, but when the legs\nhave that many bars on the 5 minute chart, traders will not use the term ``major trend reversal.’’ They will instead look for other patterns. For\nexample, if the pullback that breaks a bull trend line has 30 bars, traders will see it as a bear trend (all pullbacks in bull trends are smaller bear\ntrends), and will look for a break above the bear trend line and then a major trend line up. If the rally also has about 30 bars, they will see it as a new\nbull trend, and look for a break below its trend line and a major trend reversal down. They realize that these legs have only 10 bars on the 15 minute\nchart and form a major trend reversal on that chart, but that is not the chart that they are trading, and they will use terms that are appropriate for the\nchart in front of them.\nAn average setup has about a 40 percent chance of leading to a profitable swing, a 30 percent chance of a small loss, and a 30 percent chance\nof a small profit. Most result in trading ranges instead of opposite trends, but there is still a 70 percent chance of at least a small profit. The best\nsetups have a 60 percent chance of profitable swing trades.\nFIGURE 3.1 A Higher High Followed by a Lower High\nA major trend reversal is shown in Figure 3.1, and many other examples are mentioned on charts throughout the book.\nIf a trend reverses down at a higher high after the bull trend line break (a major trend reversal down), there is usually a lower high major trend\nreversal that will give traders a second chance to get short. AAPL had both a higher high and a lower high trend reversal. A major reversal usually\nfollows a strong break of the trend line, which is evidence that the traders in the opposite direction are getting strong. The weak bear leg to bar 4\nbarely broke the trend line, and it did not come close to falling below the last higher low in the bull trend (bar 2). It could not even hold below the\nmoving average. However, it continued sideways for many bars, indicating that the bears were strong enough to halt the bull trend for a long time.\nBar 6 was a higher high short setup after this trend line break, but because the move down to bar 4 was not particularly strong, the sell-off down\nto bar 9 stalled.\nBar 9 became the bottom of a wedge bull flag or a bull channel and a high 4 buy setup, and it formed a double bottom bull flag with bar 5. This led\nto a rally to bar 10. The move up to bar 10 was a low-momentum, low 4 short setup and a wedge bear flag, with the first push up being the lower\nhigh just before the bar 9 low. It was also the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top, but most head and shoulders tops fail and become\ntriangles or wedge bull flags. In this case, however, it became the first lower high after a trend line break and a lower high test of the bull high.\nThe bear leg to bar 9 broke well below a longer trend line, the moving average, and the last higher low of the bull trend (bar 5), and it followed a\nprevious sharp attempt at a trend reversal (the sell-off to bar 4). Also, it did not come close to testing the underside of the bull trend line or the bar 8\nfirst pullback in the first leg down. All of these were signs of strength of the trend line break and increased the chances for at least a second leg\ndown or an actual trend reversal. The bulls who bought around the bar 6 top of the bull trend saw the strength of the bears in the sell-off to bar 9 and\nthe weakness of the bulls in the rally to bar 10, and were disappointed by the price action. They used the weak rally to bar 10 as an opportunity to\nexit their longs with a small loss, and they were not willing to buy again until the market traded lower.

They realize that these legs have only 10 bars on the 15 minute chart and form a major trend reversal on that chart, but that is not the chart that they are trading, and they will use terms that are appropriate for the chart in front of them.\nAn average setup has about a 40 percent chance of leading to a profitable swing, a 30 percent chance of a small loss, and a 30 percent chance of a small profit. Most result in trading ranges instead of opposite trends, but there is still a 70 percent chance of at least a small profit. The best setups have a 60 percent chance of profitable swing trades.\nFIGURE 3.1 A Higher High Followed by a Lower High A major trend reversal is shown in Figure 3.1, and many other examples are mentioned on charts throughout the book.\nIf a trend reverses down at a higher high after the bull trend line break (a major trend reversal down), there is usually a lower high major trend reversal that will give traders a second chance to get short. AAPL had both a higher high and a lower high trend reversal. A major reversal usually follows a strong break of the trend line, which is evidence that the traders in the opposite direction are getting strong. The weak bear leg to bar 4 barely broke the trend line, and it did not come close to falling below the last higher low in the bull trend (bar 2). It could not even hold below the moving average. However, it continued sideways for many bars, indicating that the bears were strong enough to halt the bull trend for a long time.\nBar 6 was a higher high short setup after this trend line break, but because the move down to bar 4 was not particularly strong, the sell-off down to bar 9 stalled.\nBar 9 became the bottom of a wedge bull flag or a bull channel and a high 4 buy setup, and it formed a double bottom bull flag with bar 5. This led to a rally to bar 10. The move up to bar 10 was a low-momentum, low 4 short setup and a wedge bear flag, with the first push up being the lower high just before the bar 9 low. It was also the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top, but most head and shoulders tops fail and become triangles or wedge bull flags. In this case, however, it became the first lower high after a trend line break and a lower high test of the bull high.\nThe bear leg to bar 9 broke well below a longer trend line, the moving average, and the last higher low of the bull trend (bar 5), and it followed a previous sharp attempt at a trend reversal (the sell-off to bar 4). Also, it did not come close to testing the underside of the bull trend line or the bar 8 first pullback in the first leg down. All of these were signs of strength of the trend line break and increased the chances for at least a second leg down or an actual trend reversal. The bulls who bought around the bar 6 top of the bull trend saw the strength of the bears in the sell-off to bar 9 and the weakness of the bulls in the rally to bar 10, and were disappointed by the price action. They used the weak rally to bar 10 as an opportunity to exit their longs with a small loss, and they were not willing to buy again until the market traded lower.

However, a 61.8 percent retracement is never as\nprecise as the number leads one to believe, and probably no more likely than a 60, 63, or 67 percent pullback, and it has probably lost value now\nthat trading has become so computerized. For example, if a trader is selling a 50 percent pullback in what he believes is a bear swing, he might\nrisk to a new high (above bar 6) to get a test of the bar 9 bottom of the bear spike. His reward equals his risk, and since he sees the rally as a\npullback, his short has at least a 60 percent probability of success. If the market retraced higher, there is an argument that a 67 percent retracement\nis more important than a 61.8 percent retracement. Once a pullback rallies to above 50 percent, the chance of the bear resuming becomes less,\nlet’s say 50 percent. Once the probability is 50 percent or less, traders will need more of a reward if they are going to short. Since their stop is\nabove the bar 6 high, they might want a reward that is twice the size of their risk. This means that they might short a 67 percent retracement,\nbecause then a test of the bar 9 low would create a reward that is twice as large as their risk.\nFIGURE 3.2 A Lower Low Followed by a Higher Low\nThe Emini had a lower low and then a higher low major trend reversal (see Figure 3.2). The rally to bar 1 broke a bear trend line, and the bar 3 test\nof the bear low was a lower low. A lower low test usually results in at least two countertrend legs, and that is what happened here (the up moves\nfrom bars 3 and 9). Bar 9 was a higher low after the break of yesterday’s major bear trend line (broken by the rally to bar 1), and as a higher low, it\nwas the start of the second leg, and the completed second leg can be the end of the move up. A trading range is a more common outcome than a\nreversal into an opposite trend.\nThe channel down to bar 7 (from both bar 5 and bar 6) was strong. Many traders preferred to wait to see how strong the breakout was before\nbuying. The two bull bars after bar 7 had relatively big bodies and small tails, and represented a strong breakout in the eyes of many traders. At that\npoint, many traders thought that the market had become always-in long and waited to buy a pullback. The bear bar after bar 8 was an attempt to\nmake the breakout of the high 2 bull flag down to bar 7 fail (the first leg down ended three bars after bar 5). The bears wanted the bar 6 and bar 8\ndouble top to lead to a swing down. The bulls expected the bears to fail and for traders to come in and buy the test of the bar 7 low, creating a\nhigher low after the strong bull spike up to bar 5 (bar 4 and the bar after bar 3 were strong enough to make traders think that at least a second leg\nup was likely). Bar 9 was a lower low breakout pullback buy setup (and a double bottom bull flag with bar 7), and the bulls bought it aggressively.\nThe bull trend bar after bar 9 reversed the highs and closes of many prior bars, which is a sign of a strong bull reversal. It closed above the close\nof every bar since bar 6 and its high was above the high of every bar since the bar after bar 6. The more highs and closes that a strong bull bar\nreverses, the stronger the bull reversal and the more likely that there will be follow-through buying (higher prices).\nThe earliest entries in major trend reversals often do not look strong, like at bars 3 and 9. This means that the probability of success is often less\nthan 50 percent. However, the potential reward is at its greatest and the result usually is a positive trader’s equation. Traders can wait for a clear\nalways-in long reversal before buying, and this usually increases the probability to 60 percent or higher. At that point, there is less profit remaining\nand the risk is usually larger (the protective stop is further away), but the trader’s equation is usually still positive. For example, the bulls could have\nwaited to buy above the bull trend bar that followed bar 3 for a swing, or on the close of bar 4 for a scalp. They also could have bought on the close\nof the bull trend bar after bar 9 or on the close of the bull trend bar that followed it.\nThis is a good example of an average major trend reversal attempt, where the setups and context are acceptable but not strong, and the\nreversals up led to a trading range and not a bull trend, as is the case about 70 percent of the time. The bar 3 lower low led to a test of the bar 1\nhigh, which was a likely top of an evolving trading range. Some traders took full or partial profits there, while others held, expecting a second leg up,\nand exited on the failed breakout of the trading range at bar 10 (as the bear bar turned down, or below its low). The bar 3 lower low resulted in a\nscalper’s profit for traders who exited as bar 5 turned down, and a swing profit (a reward that was at least twice as large as the risk) for traders who\nexited in the reversal down after bar 10. The traders who bought the bar 7 two-legged higher low either had a small loss if they held until their\nprotective stop was hit, or they got out around breakeven if they moved their stop to breakeven after a four-bar rally above the moving average. The\ntraders who bought the bar 9 double bottom higher low (higher than bar 3), which was also a lower low for the reversal up from the small bear trend\n(bull flag) from bar 5 to bar 7, were able to exit some or all with a reward that was at least twice as large as their risk (a swing profit).\nIn an average setup like this, the chance of a profitable swing is about 40 percent, and there is about a 30 percent chance of a small profit, and a\n30 percent chance of the protective stop being hit (a small loss). The result is still a profitable strategy. In the strongest setups, the chance of a\nprofitable swing is 60 percent or greater, and maybe only a 30 to 40 percent chance of the protective stop being hit and leading to a small loss.\nBecause the trader’s equation is so strong, this is an excellent setup for all traders, including beginners.\nFIGURE 3.3 A Trend Line Break Alone Does Not Make a Reversal\n", "text_clean": "before buying, but none came, so they sat on the sidelines as the market sold off to bar 11.\nSome traders like to see a Fibonacci 61.8 percent retracement on the rally to the lower high.

The rally to bar 1 broke a bear trend line, and the bar 3 test of the bear low was a lower low. A lower low test usually results in at least two countertrend legs, and that is what happened here (the up moves from bars 3 and 9). Bar 9 was a higher low after the break of yesterday’s major bear trend line (broken by the rally to bar 1), and as a higher low, it was the start of the second leg, and the completed second leg can be the end of the move up.

The bear bar after bar 8 was an attempt to make the breakout of the high 2 bull flag down to bar 7 fail (the first leg down ended three bars after bar 5). The bears wanted the bar 6 and bar 8 double top to lead to a swing down. The bulls expected the bears to fail and for traders to come in and buy the test of the bar 7 low, creating a higher low after the strong bull spike up to bar 5 (bar 4 and the bar after bar 3 were strong enough to make traders think that at least a second leg up was likely). Bar 9 was a lower low breakout pullback buy setup (and a double bottom bull flag with bar 7), and the bulls bought it aggressively.\nThe bull trend bar after bar 9 reversed the highs and closes of many prior bars, which is a sign of a strong bull reversal. It closed above the close of every bar since bar 6 and its high was above the high of every bar since the bar after bar 6. The more highs and closes that a strong bull bar reverses, the stronger the bull reversal and the more likely that there will be follow-through buying (higher prices).\nThe earliest entries in major trend reversals often do not look strong, like at bars 3 and 9.

The bar 3 lower low led to a test of the bar 1 high, which was a likely top of an evolving trading range. Some traders took full or partial profits there, while others held, expecting a second leg up, and exited on the failed breakout of the trading range at bar 10 (as the bear bar turned down, or below its low). The bar 3 lower low resulted in a scalper’s profit for traders who exited as bar 5 turned down, and a swing profit (a reward that was at least twice as large as the risk) for traders who exited in the reversal down after bar 10. The traders who bought the bar 7 two-legged higher low either had a small loss if they held until their protective stop was hit, or they got out around breakeven if they moved their stop to breakeven after a four-bar rally above the moving average. The traders who bought the bar 9 double bottom higher low (higher than bar 3), which was also a lower low for the reversal up from the small bear trend (bull flag) from bar 5 to bar 7, were able to exit some or all with a reward that was at least twice as large as their risk (a swing profit).\nIn an average setup like this, the chance of a profitable swing is about 40 percent, and there is about a 30 percent chance of a small profit, and a 30 percent chance of the protective stop being hit (a small loss).

The market then rallied to a new high at bar 13.\nHowever, the move to bar 13 was in a very steep bull channel (the dotted D bull trend line is the bottom of the channel) and therefore traders should\nhave waited before shorting. It is always better not to short the first breakout of a steep bull channel. Wait to see if there is a pullback to a higher\nhigh or lower high. The market corrected sideways and formed a double bottom bull flag (a high 2) at bar 14, and there never was a breakout\npullback to set up the short.

When the move to the higher high is so steep with so little overlap, the odds favor a successful breakout and about a measured move\nup instead of a reversal. Once this happens, the process of looking for a reversal begins again. Wait for a trend line break, like the move down to\nbar 19, and then for a higher high, double top, or lower high test of the bull high. Although there were several tradable swings after bar 19, bar 19\nwas a climax reversal up (a spike down and then a spike up), and this is usually followed by a trading range. During the trading range, the bears\nwho created the spike down to the bar 19 low were continuing to short and trying to generate a bear channel, and the bulls who bought the bar 19\nlow were continuing to buy in an attempt to create follow-through to the upside in the form of a bull channel. Incidentally, the bulls saw bar 19 as\nsimply a large breakout test of the breakout above bars 8 and 9. Since bar 19 fell below the bar 9 breakout point, the breakout gap was negative,\nbut because the market rallied quickly up, it nonetheless was a type of breakout gap.\nThe move down to bar 5 broke the dotted trend line A, and bar 6 was a reasonable double top short setup.\nThe move down to bar 7 broke the dashed trend line B. The move up to bar 8 was in a steep channel, so it was better to wait for a breakout\nbelow the channel and then wait to see if there was a breakout pullback to short.\nBar 9 was a two-legged move up to a double top and an acceptable short.\nBar 10 was a double top bear flag and another short setup.\nBar 19 was obviously caused by some news event (it was the 2010 Flash Crash), but that is not important. What is always more important is who\ncontrols the market during and after the bar. It was in part a breakout test of the middle of the trading range between bars 4 and 12 (a test of the\nbottom of the channel from bar 11 to 17). Many traders expect a breakout to be tested, and once the market begins to move quickly in that\ndirection, as it did as bar 19 was forming, the strongest bulls began to believe that the market might fall all of the way back to the bottom of that\ntrading range. So, what should they do once they believe that the market is going lower? It does not make sense for them to keep buying when they\ncan soon buy lower. This absence of buying results in the market getting sucked down quickly in a sell vacuum to the level where the bulls believe\nthat it will find support. Even though they thought that there was value as the market was falling (you know this because the market quickly reversed\nup above most of the entire bar), they believed that it had further to go and waited until it reached support. Since they saw the market as offering\ntremendous value that they thought would be very brief, they appeared out of nowhere and bought aggressively. The bears saw the same thing and\nquickly took profits, buying back their shorts. There was no one left to sell and the market rallied strongly. Momentum programs accelerated the fall\nand the rally back up, because they detect strong momentum and trade relentlessly in its direction until the momentum slows, and then they exit with\ntheir profits. Spikes like this are common in trends. However, the test of the bottom of a channel usually leads to a trading range as it did here.

The move up to bar 8 was in a steep channel, so it was better to wait for a breakout below the channel and then wait to see if there was a breakout pullback to short.\nBar 9 was a two-legged move up to a double top and an acceptable short.\nBar 10 was a double top bear flag and another short setup.\nBar 19 was obviously caused by some news event (it was the 2010 Flash Crash), but that is not important. What is always more important is who controls the market during and after the bar. It was in part a breakout test of the middle of the trading range between bars 4 and 12 (a test of the bottom of the channel from bar 11 to 17). Many traders expect a breakout to be tested, and once the market begins to move quickly in that direction, as it did as bar 19 was forming, the strongest bulls began to believe that the market might fall all of the way back to the bottom of that trading range. So, what should they do once they believe that the market is going lower? It does not make sense for them to keep buying when they can soon buy lower. This absence of buying results in the market getting sucked down quickly in a sell vacuum to the level where the bulls believe that it will find support. Even though they thought that there was value as the market was falling (you know this because the market quickly reversed up above most of the entire bar), they believed that it had further to go and waited until it reached support. Since they saw the market as offering tremendous value that they thought would be very brief, they appeared out of nowhere and bought aggressively. The bears saw the same thing and quickly took profits, buying back their shorts. There was no one left to sell and the market rallied strongly. Momentum programs accelerated the fall and the rally back up, because they detect strong momentum and trade relentlessly in its direction until the momentum slows, and then they exit with their profits. Spikes like this are common in trends. However, the test of the bottom of a channel usually leads to a trading range as it did here. Big up + big down = big confusion = trading range.\nFIGURE 3.4 If a Test Is Too Strong, Wait", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["Just because there is a break of a bull trend line and then the market moves to a higher high, it is not always prudent to look for shorts.

As shown in Figure 3.8, traders who anticipated a reversal down placed limit orders at and above the\nsignal bar of what they thought would become the final bull flag of the leg, whether the setup was a high 1, high 2, or triangle. When they expected a\nreversal up from a down leg, they placed limit orders at and below the signal bar of what they believed was likely to be the final flag (a low 1, low 2,\nor triangle) of the bear leg. Examples of micro double bottoms were bars 1 and 2, 5 and 6, 16 and 17 (15 and 16, but the entry never triggered),\nand 19 and 20. Micro double tops were at 3 and 4, 10 and 11, and 13 and 14. Bar 8 was a reversal from the bar 7 one-bar final flag, a double top\nwith bar 4, a lower high in a bear channel, and a low 2 in a trading range (bar 6 was the low 1).\nThe bar 17 low formed a small wedge around a measured move down from the upper trading range on what, at that point, was likely to be a\ntrending trading range day. It was also a two-legged lower low from the breakout below the ii final flag that followed bar 15, and a double top with\nbar 23.\nIntraday reversals often come from larger patterns, and not just micro double bottoms and tops. Bar 22 was a two-legged rally that tested the\napex of the triangle (the upper trading range on this trending trading range day was the triangle that broke out four bars after bar 14). Bar 25 was a\nsell climax and lower low breakout pullback from the two-legged breakout to bar 22 above the bull flag that ended at bar 17 (the entire move from\nthe open down to bar 17 was a pullback after a big gap up and a huge rally yesterday and was therefore just a large bull flag).\nThe sell-off to bar 9 was a double bottom bull flag with bar 6. Bar 27 was a double top with bar 24 and the second leg up from the bar 25 low. Bar\n27 was the first bar of a micro double top, because the bar after it had a big tail on its bottom, indicating that the market went down, and then up.\nThe top of that doji inside bar formed a micro double top with the high of bar 27, and aggressive bears shorted below its low, which was the entry\nfor the breakout below the micro double top.\nAs dramatic as the bar 25 sell climax was, it was just a micro double bottom on a higher time frame chart (it was a three-bar-long micro double\nbottom on the 60 minute chart). Institutions anticipated the bottom and scaled into longs as bar 25 was forming, especially as it broke out below the\nbar 17 low. They expected the breakout to fail and therefore offer a brief opportunity to buy at a very good price. Since they control the direction of\nthe market, if enough of them expect the bottom, their buying will make it happen. The two-legged rally to bar 22 broke above the bear trend line,\nand the sell climax to bar 25 was a lower low that became the bottom of a major trend reversal up. The rally lasted two more days.\nJust because a market forms a double bottom or top does not mean that a reversal trade should be taken. The decision has to be based on\ncontext. For example, the double top at bar 27 followed six bars up and a strong sell climax, so the market could easily have gone sideways.\nThere were several examples of small final flag reversals that followed low and high 1 setups, resulting in micro double tops and bottoms. The\nbulls saw the doji bar after bar 1 as a weak low 1 breakout pullback sell signal. They bought at and below its low, expecting a bull opening reversal\nand low of the day. The doji became the final bear flag in the leg down, and bar 2 formed a double bottom with the bar 1 low.\nThe bear inside bar after bar 3 was a high 1 buy signal, but many traders thought that if the market could hold below the top of the strong two-bar\nbear spike at the open, it could form a double top and then have a downside breakout.

As shown in Figure 3.8, traders who anticipated a reversal down placed limit orders at and above the signal bar of what they thought would become the final bull flag of the leg, whether the setup was a high 1, high 2, or triangle. When they expected a reversal up from a down leg, they placed limit orders at and below the signal bar of what they believed was likely to be the final flag (a low 1, low 2, or triangle) of the bear leg. Examples of micro double bottoms were bars 1 and 2, 5 and 6, 16 and 17 (15 and 16, but the entry never triggered), and 19 and 20. Micro double tops were at 3 and 4, 10 and 11, and 13 and 14. Bar 8 was a reversal from the bar 7 one-bar final flag, a double top with bar 4, a lower high in a bear channel, and a low 2 in a trading range (bar 6 was the low 1).\nThe bar 17 low formed a small wedge around a measured move down from the upper trading range on what, at that point, was likely to be a trending trading range day. It was also a two-legged lower low from the breakout below the ii final flag that followed bar 15, and a double top with bar 23.\nIntraday reversals often come from larger patterns, and not just micro double bottoms and tops. Bar 22 was a two-legged rally that tested the apex of the triangle (the upper trading range on this trending trading range day was the triangle that broke out four bars after bar 14). Bar 25 was a sell climax and lower low breakout pullback from the two-legged breakout to bar 22 above the bull flag that ended at bar 17 (the entire move from the open down to bar 17 was a pullback after a big gap up and a huge rally yesterday and was therefore just a large bull flag).\nThe sell-off to bar 9 was a double bottom bull flag with bar 6. Bar 27 was a double top with bar 24 and the second leg up from the bar 25 low. Bar 27 was the first bar of a micro double top, because the bar after it had a big tail on its bottom, indicating that the market went down, and then up.\nThe top of that doji inside bar formed a micro double top with the high of bar 27, and aggressive bears shorted below its low, which was the entry for the breakout below the micro double top.\nAs dramatic as the bar 25 sell climax was, it was just a micro double bottom on a higher time frame chart (it was a three-bar-long micro double bottom on the 60 minute chart). Institutions anticipated the bottom and scaled into longs as bar 25 was forming, especially as it broke out below the bar 17 low. They expected the breakout to fail and therefore offer a brief opportunity to buy at a very good price. Since they control the direction of the market, if enough of them expect the bottom, their buying will make it happen. The two-legged rally to bar 22 broke above the bear trend line, and the sell climax to bar 25 was a lower low that became the bottom of a major trend reversal up. The rally lasted two more days.\nJust because a market forms a double bottom or top does not mean that a reversal trade should be taken. The decision has to be based on context. For example, the double top at bar 27 followed six bars up and a strong sell climax, so the market could easily have gone sideways.\nThere were several examples of small final flag reversals that followed low and high 1 setups, resulting in micro double tops and bottoms. The bulls saw the doji bar after bar 1 as a weak low 1 breakout pullback sell signal. They bought at and below its low, expecting a bull opening reversal and low of the day. The doji became the final bear flag in the leg down, and bar 2 formed a double bottom with the bar 1 low.\nThe bear inside bar after bar 3 was a high 1 buy signal, but many traders thought that if the market could hold below the top of the strong two-bar bear spike at the open, it could form a double top and then have a downside breakout. Bears shorted at the high of the bear inside bar, expecting it to become a failed high 1, which would also be a one-bar final flag and a double top.\nThe bear inside bar after bar 5 was a breakout pullback sell signal bar.

This is the most fundamental aspect of all trading\nand is at the heart of everything that we do. Every trend bar is a breakout, which might have follow-through and succeed, or fail and lead to a\nreversal. Even a climactic reversal like a V bottom is simply a breakout and then a failed breakout. The better traders become at assessing\nwhether a breakout will succeed or fail, the better positioned they are to make a living as a trader. Will the breakout succeed? If yes, then look to\ntrade in that direction. If no (and it becomes a failed breakout, which is a reversal), then look to trade in the opposite direction. All trading comes\ndown to this decision.\nMany people restrict the definition of a climax to a sharp move at the end of a trend that is followed by a sharp move in the opposite direction,\nresulting in a trend reversal. A broader definition is more useful to traders: any type of unsustainable behavior should be considered to be a type of\nclimax, whether or not a reversal follows. Just how small can a climax be? As mentioned in Chapter 2 of book 1, every trend bar is a climax,\nalthough most do not result in climactic reversals. Any trend bar or series of trend bars where the bar or bars have relatively large ranges are\nclimaxes, even though most traders would not think of them this way. A climax ends as soon as there is any interruption of the strong trending\nbehavior, such as the formation of a pause bar or a reversal bar. Even a single large trend bar can be a climax. Most climaxes are usually followed\nby a trading range that lasts one or more bars, instead of by a spike in the opposite direction, and the trend often resumes instead of reverses. A\nclimactic reversal is a climax that is soon followed by a sharp move in the opposite direction, and all are failed breakouts of something. For\nexample, if there is a trading range in a bull market and it has a bear leg down from the top, this leg down is a bear channel and therefore a bull flag.\nIf the market has one or more bull trend bars breaking above the channel, it is a breakout of the bull flag. If the market then reverses down, even if\nthe reversal is from a lower high (the buy climax did not break above the trading range), this is still a climactic reversal. When a market is moving\nclimactically, fundamental traders often refer to the market as being a crowded trade, meaning that they believe that too many people already have\na position, so there might not be many traders left to keep pushing the market further in the trend. For example, if the market is moving up\nparabolically, the fundamental analysts will often say that it is a crowded trade and that they would only look to buy a pullback. Most would not\nadvocate going short, even though they believe that a significant pullback is imminent. Other examples of buy climaxes include the 2006 housing\nbubble, the tech wreck of 2000, and the tulip mania of 1637. They were all examples of the greater fool theory of investing—buy high with the\nexpectation that someone dumber than you will buy from you even higher, allowing you to exit with a profit. Once there are no fools left, the market\ncan go in only one direction, and it often goes there quickly. China and Brazil might be developing bubbles, because they appear to be growing at\nan unsustainable pace. Momentum traders might be responsible for much of the growth at this point, meaning that its pace is not sufficiently based\non fundamentals. Once profit takers come in, the reversal could be fast and deep. Investors could panic as they attempt to exit with at least minimal\nprofits, and the hope of averting a big loss, as is the case with any climax.\nSometimes when the market is in a strong trend, a bar forms that has an exceptionally large range and body, and it may open near one extreme\nand close near the other. This can be either a climax or a breakout. For example, suppose the market is selling off and then a bear trend bar forms\nthat opens near its high and closes near its low, and the body and range are the largest of the down move, maybe twice the size of many of the bear\ntrend bars. This bar might represent the last desperate longs who are so eager to get out that they are selling at the market instead of waiting for a\npullback. They are finally giving up and want out at any price. Once the last long has exited, there is no one left to short. The institutions are not\nshorting here because they already shorted much higher. In fact, they are taking profits on their shorts at the bottom of the bar and many are likely\ngoing long there. The market can then reverse up sharply within the next couple of bars once traders sense that there is no significant follow-through\nselling. However, if that large bear trend bar is a breakout of one or more areas of support, it might generate a measured move down before\nattempting to reverse again.\nAn important component of a climax is a vacuum effect created by the absence of traders in the opposite direction. For example, if the market is\naccelerating to the upside toward the top of a bull channel, there will be institutional bears who believe that the market will soon reverse, but that the\nmarket will likely first break out above the trend channel line. Why would they choose to short as the market is racing toward the line when they\nbelieve that it will soon be above the line? It makes no sense for them to go short when they think that the market will soon be higher and they could\nshort at an even better price. So what do they do? They wait. The same is true for the strong bulls. They are looking to take partial or full profits, but\nif they believe that the market will soon be a little higher, they will not sell until the market reaches a resistance area that they think the market will\nlikely not exceed, at least for the time being. This means that there are some very strong bears who are not shorting, and some very strong bulls\nwho are not selling out of their longs, and the absence of selling creates a vacuum that sucks the market up higher to a level where the bears feel\nthere is value in shorting and the bulls feel there is value in taking profits. The programs that detect the momentum early on in a bar see this and\nquickly buy repeatedly until the momentum slows. Because these buy programs will buy up to the final tick and are relatively unopposed, the market\nraces up in a strong bull spike that can last several bars. But what happens once the market reaches a level where the bears feel that there is value\nand the bulls feel that the market is unlikely to go much higher before a pullback, like several ticks above that trend channel line? These huge\ninstitutional bears will begin to short heavily and relentlessly, and the strong bulls will sell out of their longs, because they feel that this price level is a\ngreat value. The buy programs will see the loss of momentum and sell out of their longs. Since it is such a great value for shorting and profit taking,\nit cannot last long, so bulls and bears sell very aggressively on this brief opportunity. Since both the strong bulls and the bears expect lower prices,\nthat’s what will follow. With all of the major traders selling and no longer buying the market reverses down, at least for about 10 bars and a couple of\nlegs. At that point, they will decide whether the pullback has ended and the bulls should buy back their longs and the bears should scalp out of their\nshorts, or they believe that the sell-off has further to go.\nThe weak traders do the opposite as the market is racing up: the weak bulls who were sitting on the sidelines finally buy, and the weak bears\ncover their shorts, both unrealistically afraid of another big leg up. Experienced traders can do exactly what the institutions are doing. For example,\nthey can short the close of that strong bull trend bar, above its high, or at the close of the next bar or two. If they do, they should use a stop that is\nabout as many ticks as the bull trend bar is tall. If they wait for a bear reversal bar and short on a stop below its low, they can risk to above the signal\nbar’s high. Alternatively, they could use a wider protective stop to allow for one more minor high, but if they do, they need to reduce the size of their\nposition.\n", "text_clean": "CHAPTER 4\nClimactic Reversals: A Spike Followed by a Spike in the Opposite Direction The market is always trying to break out, and then the market tries to make every breakout fail.

{"book": "REVERSAL", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\reversal3.pdf", "page_index": 57, "text_raw": "The strong bulls keep buying during the bull spike because they, too, believe that the market will go higher. However, at some point, they know\nthat the market will have gone too far, too fast, and that there will be just a brief window where they can sell out of their longs with a windfall profit. If\nthey wait too long, the pullback might become a reversal and they will lose out on the opportunity to exit at a very high price. They then seize this\nbrief moment to sell out of their longs. Their aggressive profit taking combined with the aggressive selling by institutional shorts makes the market\nfall very quickly for a bar or two or even longer, and this creates a climactic reversal. The bulls will try to buy back lower, hoping that the reversal will\nfail, but if they are not able to push the market back up, they will sell out of their longs once again. The bears who sold higher are continuing to sell\ndown here, and both they and the bulls are fighting in a trading range over the direction of the channel that will follow. If the bears win, there will\nusually be a spike and channel bear trend with the spike being the sharp move down from the climactic top. If the bulls win, there will usually be a\nspike and channel bull trend with the spike being the sharp move up to the top of the buy climax.\nSpikes are tests of the strength of both the trend and countertrend traders. A bull trend is made of a series of higher highs and lows, both of which\ncan be created by spikes. If the market has a spike up in a bull trend and then a selloff in the form of a spike down, the probability is that the market\nwill test and exceed the top of the bull spike, but not come back and test the bottom of the bear spike. The bull spike will be just another leg up in the\nbull trend and the spike down will usually just evolve into a bull flag and a higher low, and will likely not get tested once the bull trend resumes. The\nsame is true for a bear trend, which is made up of lower highs and lows. The most recent new low, whether or not it is in the form of a spike, will\nlikely get tested and exceeded after any pullback. Any rally, whether it is in the form of a strong bull spike or a quiet move up, will likely evolve into a\nbear flag and just another lower high, and will usually not get tested. There is a widely held, but incorrect, belief that the strongest rallies occur during\nbear trends and the strongest selloffs occur during bull trends. While this is not true, it is important to realize that countertrend spikes can be\nexceptionally strong and make many traders believe that the trend has reversed. All spikes, up and down, in bull or bear trends or in trading ranges,\nare simply tests of the determination of the countertrend traders and the resolve of the with trend traders. The pullbacks often come close to flipping\nthe always-in position to the opposite direction, but there is inadequate follow-through. Strong traders love these reversal attempts, because they\nknow that most will fail. Whenever the countertrend traders are able to create one, the with trend traders come in and heavily fight the reversal\nattempt, and usually win. They see these sharp countertrend moves as great opportunities to enter in the direction of the trend at a great price that\nis likely to exist only briefly, and quickly become simply a spike pullback in the trend.\nEvery pullback is a small trend, and every trend is just a pullback on a higher time frame chart. This includes the 1987 and 2008–2009 stock\nmarket crashes, which were just pullbacks to the monthly bull trend line. Every countertrend spike should be considered to be a vacuum effect\npullback, and many pullbacks end with or soon after very strong trend bars that are attempts to reverse the trend. For example, if there is a sharp\nbear spike in a bull trend on the 5 minute chart and then the market suddenly reverses into a bull leg, there was an area of support at the low,\nwhether or not you saw it in advance. The bulls stepped aside until the market reached a level where they believed that value was great and the\nopportunity to buy at this great price would be brief. They know that most attempts to reverse fail, and that many reversal attempts have strong bear\ntrend bars. They bet against the follow-through selling that traders would need to see to be confident of an always-in reversal, and they came in and\nbought aggressively at the close of the bar and as the next bar was forming. Since there was no one left to short, the market raced up for many\nbars, ending the pullback and resuming the trend. The smart bears were aware of that magnet, and they used it as an opportunity to take profits on\ntheir shorts.\nThe market is always trying to reverse (although most attempts fail), and a successful reversal needs follow-through to convince traders that the\nalways-in direction has flipped. These spikes come close to forming convincing flips, but fail to have enough follow-through. The result is that they\nmake traders wonder if the always-in position will flip, but when the follow-through is inadequate, they decide that the reversal attempt will fail. The\nbulls then see the spike down as a brief opportunity to buy at a great price. The bears who shorted near the bottom of the bear trend bar and higher\nalso realize that the reversal attempt is failing, and they quickly buy back their shorts and step aside until they see another opportunity to try to take\ncontrol of the market again. The result is a market bottom on the 5 minute chart. That bottom, like all bottoms, occurs at some higher time frame\nsupport level, like a bull trend line, a moving average, or a bear trend channel line along the bottom of a large bull flag. It is important to remember\nthat if the 5 minute reversal was strong, traders would buy based on that reversal, whether or not they saw support on the daily or 60 minute chart.\nAlso, traders would not buy at that low, even if they saw the higher time frame support, unless there was evidence on the 5 minute chart that it was\nforming a bottom. This means that they do not need to be looking at lots of different charts in search of that support level, because the reversal on\nthe 5 minute chart tells them that it is there. If they are able to follow multiple time frames, they will see support and resistance levels before the\nmarket reaches them, and this can alert them to look for a setup on the 5 minute chart when the market reaches the magnet; but if they simply\ncarefully follow the 5 minute chart, it will tell them all that they need to know.\nStock traders routinely buy strong bear spikes in bull trends because they see the spike as a value play. Although they usually look for strong\nprice action before buying, they will often buy a stock that they like at the bottom of a sharp sell-off, especially to the area of the bull trend line or\nother support area, like a trading range low, even if it has not yet reversed up. They believe that the market is temporarily, incorrectly underpricing\nthe stock because of some news event, and they buy it because they doubt it will remain discounted for long. They don’t mind if it falls a little further,\nbecause they doubt that they can pick the exact bottom of the pullback; but they want to get in during the sell-off because they believe that the\nmarket will quickly correct its mistake and the stock will soon rally.\nA climax is simply any market that has gone too far, too fast in the eyes of traders. It is a trend bar or a series of trend bars with little overlap, and\nit can occur at any time, including as a breakout, at the start of a trend, or after a trend has gone on for many bars. The market pauses after the\nspike, and then the trend can resume or reverse. When there is a large spike and it is followed either immediately or soon thereafter by a spike in\nthe opposite direction, the market is trying to reverse. When this happens, it creates a climactic reversal, which is a two-bar reversal that may be\nvisible only on a higher or lower time frame chart. For example, if there is a bull trend that has gone on for 20 bars and now has the largest bull trend\nbar of the entire trend, traders will wonder if it is a climactic end to the trend (a blow off top). If there is then a strong bear trend bar or two on the\nreversal down, the bear spike forms a two-bar reversal with the final bull trend bar or bars of the climax, whether or not there were several bars\nseparating the final bull trend bar and the first bear trend bar. On a higher time frame chart, traders can see a simple two-bar reversal. This will be a\nsimple reversal bar on an even higher time frame chart. As long as you understand what the market is doing, there is no need to look through\nseveral time frames in search of a perfect two-bar reversal setup. You know it exists by what you are seeing on the chart in front of you, and that is\nall you need to place a trade.\nBoth bulls and bears will sell when there is a second or third consecutive buy climax without much of a correction between the climaxes, and this\nselling can lead to a climactic reversal. The bears are selling to initiate shorts for what they believe will be at least a scalp down. The bulls see the\nfinal large bull trend bar or two as a great price to take profits, since they believe it is likely at least a temporary end of the trend, and beginning of a\ndeeper pullback, a trading range, or an opposite trend. They expect the market to trend down for about 10 bars and two legs, and are afraid that the\nbull trend might have ended and the old high might not be exceeded. When there is a second buy climax and then a reversal setup, both bulls and\n", "text_clean": "The strong bulls keep buying during the bull spike because they, too, believe that the market will go higher. However, at some point, they know that the market will have gone too far, too fast, and that there will be just a brief window where they can sell out of their longs with a windfall profit. If they wait too long, the pullback might become a reversal and they will lose out on the opportunity to exit at a very high price. They then seize this brief moment to sell out of their longs. Their aggressive profit taking combined with the aggressive selling by institutional shorts makes the market fall very quickly for a bar or two or even longer, and this creates a climactic reversal. The bulls will try to buy back lower, hoping that the reversal will fail, but if they are not able to push the market back up, they will sell out of their longs once again. The bears who sold higher are continuing to sell down here, and both they and the bulls are fighting in a trading range over the direction of the channel that will follow. If the bears win, there will usually be a spike and channel bear trend with the spike being the sharp move down from the climactic top. If the bulls win, there will usually be a spike and channel bull trend with the spike being the sharp move up to the top of the buy climax.\nSpikes are tests of the strength of both the trend and countertrend traders. A bull trend is made of a series of higher highs and lows, both of which can be created by spikes. If the market has a spike up in a bull trend and then a selloff in the form of a spike down, the probability is that the market will test and exceed the top of the bull spike, but not come back and test the bottom of the bear spike. The bull spike will be just another leg up in the bull trend and the spike down will usually just evolve into a bull flag and a higher low, and will likely not get tested once the bull trend resumes. The same is true for a bear trend, which is made up of lower highs and lows. The most recent new low, whether or not it is in the form of a spike, will likely get tested and exceeded after any pullback. Any rally, whether it is in the form of a strong bull spike or a quiet move up, will likely evolve into a bear flag and just another lower high, and will usually not get tested. There is a widely held, but incorrect, belief that the strongest rallies occur during bear trends and the strongest selloffs occur during bull trends. While this is not true, it is important to realize that countertrend spikes can be exceptionally strong and make many traders believe that the trend has reversed. All spikes, up and down, in bull or bear trends or in trading ranges, are simply tests of the determination of the countertrend traders and the resolve of the with trend traders. The pullbacks often come close to flipping the always-in position to the opposite direction, but there is inadequate follow-through. Strong traders love these reversal attempts, because they know that most will fail. Whenever the countertrend traders are able to create one, the with trend traders come in and heavily fight the reversal attempt, and usually win. They see these sharp countertrend moves as great opportunities to enter in the direction of the trend at a great price that is likely to exist only briefly, and quickly become simply a spike pullback in the trend.\nEvery pullback is a small trend, and every trend is just a pullback on a higher time frame chart.

{"book": "REVERSAL", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\reversal3.pdf", "page_index": 58, "text_raw": "bears wonder if the market is setting up a final flag reversal (with the pullback after the first buy climax being the final flag). When the reversal signal\nbar forms after a third push up, traders wonder if the market is creating a wedge top. The opposite is true after consecutive sell climaxes where\ntraders look for possible final flag and wedge bottoms.\nWhen the climax is very impressive and the context is right, they will sell out of their entire long positions. If they thought that the market would only\nfall a few ticks, they would not exit their longs and then try to buy a couple of ticks lower. They are exiting because they expect that they will be able\nto buy low enough below their exit price that the additional profit will more than make up for transaction costs. They are also concerned that the\nmarket might reverse into a bear trend, or at least into a deep enough pullback so that the market might not make another high for more bars than\nthey would be willing to wait. Because they are not looking to buy until the market trades down significantly, there is an absence of buyers. Also,\nstrong bears will short as the market falls. Because there are more sellers than buyers, the pullback can be sharp and even become a trend\nreversal. If the market instead continues up after their exit, they will look to buy again higher or on a pullback. If the market begins to turn down, they\nwill look to buy lower if there is a setup, but usually not for about 10 bars. If there is no buy setup after 10 or 20 bars, then the trend has likely\nreversed to down, and then traders would not be looking to buy. If there is a buy setup after about 10 bars and two legs, the bulls will reinstate their\nlongs and the bears will take profits on their shorts.\nConsecutive climaxes increase the chances of a correction. For example, if there is a buy climax (one or a few large bull trend bars) and then\nonly a brief pause or pullback and then a second buy climax, the odds of a significant correction or a reversal are higher. If there is instead just\nanother small pullback and then a third buy climax, the market will usually begin at least a two-legged correction that will last at least 10 bars. The\npause can be any bar that is not another big bull trend bar. A doji with a bear or bull body or a bear trend bar, which might be small, are the most\ncommon pauses. The pause bar sometimes has a high that is slightly above the high of the second buy climax bar, but still acts as a one-bar final\nflag and leads to a reversal after the third climax. The third climax is usually only one or two large bull trend bars. The consecutive climaxes indicate\nthat the market might have gone too far, too fast, and bulls might then only be willing to buy much lower. Two consecutive buy climaxes create two\npushes up and is effectively a double top, even though the second high is much higher. Three consecutive buy climaxes is a wedge top. The\nsecond top can be far above the first and the third can be far above the second, and the pattern can look more like a bull spike than a wedge.\nHowever, they have the same implications and can be traded the same. Only very experienced traders should short buy climaxes because it is\neasy to misread the price action and end up shorting a strong bull where there really is no significant climax or reversal pattern.\nIf a pullback after a buy climax lasts 10 or more bars and it breaks out of the bottom of a bull channel, it usually has sufficiently worked off the\nexcess so that if there is another buy climax, there is less of a sense of excess and less of a need for a big correction. Some trends have a series\nof strong breakouts and then trading ranges. Each breakout is a spike and therefore a buy climax, but the trading ranges that follow show that the\nstrong bulls are still buying near the high. This means that the breakout was created more by strong bulls than by weak bears who were buying back\ntheir shorts in a panic. The market is now going sideways because the strong bulls believe it will go higher and are not waiting for lower prices, and\nthe strong bears are not shorting aggressively, because they too believe that the market will go higher. It does not make sense for them to begin to\nestablish shorts if they believe that they will be able to do so higher.\nThe reversal spike can be smaller or larger than the trend spike, and if it is larger, the odds of a reversal are greater. After the initial move of the\nreversal spike, the market then either pauses or forms a trading range, which can be brief or last for dozens of bars. During this pause, both the\nbulls and the bears are adding to their positions in an attempt to get follow-through in the form of a channel in their direction. For example, if there is\na strong spike up and then a strong move down, both the bulls and the bears are being aggressive. The spike down can be in the same bar as the\nspike up, and when that happens, there will be a large tail at the top of a large bar. On a smaller time frame, there would be one or more bull trend\nbars followed by one or more bear trend bars. Alternatively, the spike down can be on the next bar or even several bars later. On a higher time\nframe, the reversal would simply be a bull trend bar immediately followed by a bear trend bar, creating a two-bar reversal. On an even higher time\nframe, the reversal would be a single reversal bar. The spike down may have follow-through over the next bar or several bars. Whether or not it\ndoes, the market will soon pause or correct some back up. Very often, it will form a trading range that can be brief or last for dozens of bars. The\nbulls are buying more, trying to push the market up into a bull channel, and the bears are selling in the trading range, hoping for a channel down. At\nsome point, one side will win and the other side will be forced to cover. If the bulls win, the bears will buy back their shorts, adding to the buying\npressure and increasing the strength of the rally. If the bears win, the bulls will have to sell out of their longs, and this will enhance the force of the\nbear channel.\nWhen a climactic reversal occurs in a trend, the reversal usually takes place after a breakout of a trend channel line. A reversal back into a\nchannel often leads to a test of the opposite side of the channel, which offers a good trading opportunity. Because of this, it is important to be\nlooking for channels, and if you see a breakout through the trend channel line and an immediate and strong reversal, be prepared to take the\nreversal entry. Sometimes the trend will resume within a bar or two and break beyond the channel line again and that second breakout will also fail.\nWhen that happens, the reversal trade is even more reliable.\nSometimes a double top bear flag forms within the trading range after a buy climax, providing an additional reason to enter short into a trend\nreversal trade. If instead there is a double bottom bull flag, it is a buy setup. The opposite is true after a sell climax. If there is a double bottom bull\nflag after the spike up off the low, it is a buy setup. If the trading range after the reversal up instead forms a double top, it is a sell setup.\nThe reversal leg that leads to the trading range is often relatively small compared to the prior trend, but it usually breaks the trend line and it can\nbe the first leg of an opposite trend. Despite that, it still can be easy to overlook, so whenever there is a climactic move, it is something that you\nshould try to find. It may have a low-momentum drift toward the old extreme, leading to a failed test (a lower high at a bull top or a higher low at a\nbottom), or it could continue to a new extreme and there may not be a reversal. If instead it does reverse, the new, opposite trend sometimes\nbecomes very strong very fast and often forms a spike and channel trend pattern.\nAn inside bar after a breakout bar is often soon followed by a trend bar in the opposite direction, creating a climactic reversal setup. As with all\nclimactic reversal setups, the channel that follows can go either way, and the important thing is to be aware of both possibilities. Once the trend\nbegins, look for with-trend setups.\nSometimes there can be an impressive spike, then a pullback, and then the start of a channel, only for the channel to fail and reverse direction. In\nhindsight, that pullback was the spike in the opposite direction and it led to a channel in the opposite direction. However, once you recognize it,\nthen you know there is an opposite, new trend and you should try to take every with-trend entry.\nStrong climactic reversals without a significant test of the extreme occur only a few times a month on 5 minute charts. These are sometimes\ncalled V bottoms and inverted V tops, which are simply two-bar reversals. The up and down spikes can contain many bars, but there is always a\nhigher time frame where the pattern is a simple two-bar reversal. However, as with any type of reversal pattern, most attempts to form a climactic\nreversal fail, or the market at least tests the spike before reversing. In a bull market, most spike tops get tested, and in a bear market, most V\nbottoms get tested, no matter how emotional and strong the reversal appears to be.

On a smaller time frame, there would be one or more bull trend bars followed by one or more bear trend bars. Alternatively, the spike down can be on the next bar or even several bars later. On a higher time frame, the reversal would simply be a bull trend bar immediately followed by a bear trend bar, creating a two-bar reversal. On an even higher time frame, the reversal would be a single reversal bar. The spike down may have follow-through over the next bar or several bars. Whether or not it does, the market will soon pause or correct some back up. Very often, it will form a trading range that can be brief or last for dozens of bars. The bulls are buying more, trying to push the market up into a bull channel, and the bears are selling in the trading range, hoping for a channel down. At some point, one side will win and the other side will be forced to cover. If the bulls win, the bears will buy back their shorts, adding to the buying pressure and increasing the strength of the rally. If the bears win, the bulls will have to sell out of their longs, and this will enhance the force of the bear channel.\nWhen a climactic reversal occurs in a trend, the reversal usually takes place after a breakout of a trend channel line. A reversal back into a channel often leads to a test of the opposite side of the channel, which offers a good trading opportunity. Because of this, it is important to be looking for channels, and if you see a breakout through the trend channel line and an immediate and strong reversal, be prepared to take the reversal entry. Sometimes the trend will resume within a bar or two and break beyond the channel line again and that second breakout will also fail.\nWhen that happens, the reversal trade is even more reliable.\nSometimes a double top bear flag forms within the trading range after a buy climax, providing an additional reason to enter short into a trend reversal trade. If instead there is a double bottom bull flag, it is a buy setup. The opposite is true after a sell climax. If there is a double bottom bull flag after the spike up off the low, it is a buy setup. If the trading range after the reversal up instead forms a double top, it is a sell setup.\nThe reversal leg that leads to the trading range is often relatively small compared to the prior trend, but it usually breaks the trend line and it can be the first leg of an opposite trend. Despite that, it still can be easy to overlook, so whenever there is a climactic move, it is something that you should try to find. It may have a low-momentum drift toward the old extreme, leading to a failed test (a lower high at a bull top or a higher low at a bottom), or it could continue to a new extreme and there may not be a reversal. If instead it does reverse, the new, opposite trend sometimes becomes very strong very fast and often forms a spike and channel trend pattern.\nAn inside bar after a breakout bar is often soon followed by a trend bar in the opposite direction, creating a climactic reversal setup. As with all climactic reversal setups, the channel that follows can go either way, and the important thing is to be aware of both possibilities. Once the trend begins, look for with-trend setups.\nSometimes there can be an impressive spike, then a pullback, and then the start of a channel, only for the channel to fail and reverse direction. In hindsight, that pullback was the spike in the opposite direction and it led to a channel in the opposite direction. However, once you recognize it, then you know there is an opposite, new trend and you should try to take every with-trend entry.\nStrong climactic reversals without a significant test of the extreme occur only a few times a month on 5 minute charts. These are sometimes called V bottoms and inverted V tops, which are simply two-bar reversals. The up and down spikes can contain many bars, but there is always a higher time frame where the pattern is a simple two-bar reversal. However, as with any type of reversal pattern, most attempts to form a climactic reversal fail, or the market at least tests the spike before reversing. In a bull market, most spike tops get tested, and in a bear market, most V bottoms get tested, no matter how emotional and strong the reversal appears to be.

Here, it is the bottom of a bull flag and not the bottom of a bear trend that is trying to reverse into a bull trend.

It is just the top of a bear flag and not the top\nof a bull trend that is in the process of reversing.\nClimaxes, parabolas, and V tops and bottoms all have one thing in common, and that is their slope. Instead of it being linear (a straight line), it is\ncurved and increasing. At some point, the market quickly reverses direction, and usually, at the very least, there will be a protracted sideways move\nand possibly a trend reversal. All of these patterns are simply trend channel line overshoots and reversals and therefore they should be traded as\nsuch; giving them special names adds nothing to your trading success. The trend channel line might not be obvious at the moment of the reversal,\nbut once a parabolic move is underway, price action traders are constantly drawing and redrawing trend channel lines and then watching for an\novershoot and reversal. The best reversals have large reversal bars and preferably a second entry. The first leg of the reversal will almost always\nbreak the trend line, and if it does not, then the reversal is suspect, and a trading range or continuation pattern becomes much more likely. When\ntrading countertrend, it is better to wait for a test of the old trend before trading in the opposite direction. For example, it is a more profitable\nstrategy to buy a higher low after a sell climax than it is to buy the initial reversal up, because too many reversal attempts fail. If a second entry fails,\nthe old trend will likely run for at least two more legs.\nParabolic moves often have three pushes and therefore are wedge tops, which are discussed more in a following chapter. The third push is a\nstrong breakout that runs for several bars to a support or resistance level, which may not be obvious, and then the market stalls and can reverse\nsharply. The breakout is beyond a two-push pattern where traders were expecting a reversal, like a higher high at the top of a trading range (or a\nlower low at the bottom). Remember, a higher high is just a two-legged rally, and therefore the reversal down is a low 2 short setup. Only\nexperienced traders should ever attempt to fade a strong trend, even when it might be forming a climactic reversal. Most traders should wait to see\nif the always-in direction reverses before looking to trade in the opposite direction (for example, after a parabolic bull trend reverses down strongly\nenough to now be in a bear trend). If the market triggers the climactic reversal short after the second or third buy climax, and then rallies above the\nhigh, there is sometimes a violent breakout as traders switch from trading range mode back into bull trend mode, expecting a measured move up. If\nthe market reverses down from a buy climax, the reversal down usually comes from some form of double top that might only be obvious on a\nsmaller time frame chart but can be inferred from the 5 minute chart. The reversal can be sharp, or the market might pull back for several bars and\nform a flag, which then might break out in the wrong direction (down, instead of up), before the market then moves down as fast as it moved up.\nTrend lines and trend channel lines should hold and lead to reversals away from the lines, indicating that they were successful in containing the\ntrend. Sometimes one will fail to hold the price action and the market will not stop and reverse on the test of the line. The breaking of a trend line\nhas the opposite implication from the breaking of a trend channel line. The break of a trend line means that a possible trend reversal is underway,\nbut breaking a trend channel line means that the trend has increased in strength and is now steeper. However, most trend channel line breakouts\nfail within about five bars and the market then reenters the channel and usually pokes through the opposite side of the channel (it breaks through the\ntrend line).\nA trend line break is the first step in a trend reversal, and if the break is on strength, the odds of a successful test of the trend’s extreme increase.\nFor example, after a bear trend line break, the test of the low would likely form a higher low and then at least a second leg up, or a lower low and\nthen at least a two-legged up move.\nSteep trend lines with one- or two-bar false breakouts are reliable with trend patterns, and therefore attract a lot of traders. However, whenever a\nreliable pattern fails, then there will be an unusually large number of trapped traders. The reverse move will likely be a profitable trade, and it can be\nsharp and result in a trend reversal. These reversal attempts are common on the 1 minute chart, but it is far better to not trade countertrend off 1\nminute charts since most reversals fail. You should almost always trade in the direction of the 5 minute chart.\nWhenever a trend channel line fails (the market breaks through it instead of bouncing off it), you should assume that the trend is much stronger\nthan you thought and you should look for with-trend entries. However, be aware that the trend channel line breakout might soon fail and lead to a\nreversal, so be prepared to exit any breakout pullback quickly if it starts to fail.\nTrend channel line overshoots are parabolic moves because for the market to go beyond the trend channel line, the market is accelerating, which\nmeans that it is becoming parabolic. It the market reverses, it will usually have at least a 10-bar and two-legged correction. If it reenters the channel,\nit will usually poke out of the other side of the channel, beyond the trend line, and it may become a trend reversal.\nTraditional technical analysis teaches that major reversals come with exceptional volume, especially at market bottoms. That is more often true\nwith stocks, especially those that have smaller volume, but it is not a reliable sign in huge markets. Most major reversals up or down in markets like\nthe SPY or Emini occur in the absence of clearly understandable volume patterns, although sometimes there is huge volume at a climactic market\nbottom, when there is a sell vacuum into a support level and the bears finally take profits and the bulls finally buy aggressively. When there is a\nreversal up from a bottom where one or more bars have 10 to 20 times the volume of the most of the bars of recent days, the odds of more follow-\nthrough buying are greater. Also, if there is a bull spike with 10 to 20 times the average volume and a range that is five or more times larger than\nmost bars of recent days, the odds are good that there will be higher prices over the next many bars. The market will usually go up for at least a\nmeasured move. Much less often, the market instead falls below the bull spike and then has a measured move down.\nClimactic tops are rarely as dramatic and rarely have useful volume patterns. Active traders who pay attention to volume will likely miss out on\nmany good trades and make less money than if they simply traded on the price action alone. While it is true that most tradable tops and bottoms\nwhere the volume is unusually high will have a volume divergence on the 1 minute chart, most traders will make more money if they ignore it and\ncarefully watch the price action on the 5 minute chart or some other higher time frame chart. The 1 minute volume divergence means that the final\nlow will have less volume than a recent previous attempt to reverse up. There are usually tick and oscillator divergences as well, but experienced\ntraders are aware of this when they see a tradable bottom, and will not feel a need to check for something that they already know is present.\nThe key to understanding climactic reversals is to realize that they are just failed breakouts. For example, when a bull trend goes on for 40 bars\nwithout much of a pullback and then has the biggest bull trend bar of the trend, and it has small tails and a close well above the high of the prior bar,\ngiving it the look of an exceptionally strong breakout, the odds of follow-through buying are less than with all of the other breakouts earlier in the\ntrend. This is because experienced traders will expect a transition into a trading range after a trend goes on for dozens of bars without much of a\npullback. They know that the probabilities begin to favor this. If instead the market has the strongest breakout of the trend at this point, the market is\ntrying to convert an overdone bull trend into an even steeper bull trend, and the chance of success is probably less than 30 percent. The bulls and\nbears look to fade the breakout, expecting it to fail and become an exhaustion gap instead of a measuring gap, and be followed by at least a two-\nlegged, ten-bar correction to the moving average.

The ones who are flat and missed the entire rally are afraid that they are now missing the strongest part of the bull trend and buy. The\nweak bears who have been holding, hoping for a reversal, are terrified and buy back their shorts, Both are doing the exact opposite of what the\ninstitutions are doing and are therefore doomed to lose money. The beginners are such a small part of the market that their effect is not significant,\nalthough decades ago this type of backwards behavior by beginners and experienced traders was probably an important component of climactic\nreversals. Today’s smart traders don’t buy in a panic, and instead fade likely climaxes. Most breakouts fail, and sometimes the strongest breakout\nattempts are the most likely to fail.\nFIGURE 4.1 Late Acceleration Can Be Exhaustion\nIf a trend suddenly accelerates, it can be a successful breakout, leading to another leg down, or an exhaustive end of the trend. In Figure 4.1, bar 13\nand bar 15 on this 5-minute Emini chart had very large ranges and bodies and followed several other bear bars, but signified opposite conditions.\nBar 13 was a breakout below a trading range in a possible trend-resumption bear trend day. It became a measuring gap. Strong breakouts usually\nhave at least two legs, as was the case here. The pullback after the second sell climax can be a single bar or several bars, and the low of one or\nmore of those bars can be below the low of the sell climax, as it was here in the bear flag to bar 14.bar 15 was a larger bear trend bar and therefore\nrepresented even more intense selling, and the market became almost vertical. The last longs had sold out and there was no one left to sell. It\nbecame an exhaustion gap as the market reversed above its high. Consecutive sell climaxes often are followed by at least a 10-bar, two-legged\nreversal. (I use the phrase “10-bar, two-legged” often, and my intention is to say that the correction will last longer and be more complex than a small\npullback. That type of correction usually requires at least 10 bars and two legs.) The strong bull reversal traded back into the trading range, which,\nlike all trading ranges, was a magnet.\nAll strong bulls and bears love to see an exceptionally large trend bar like bar 15 after a protracted trend, because they expect it to be a brief,\nunusually great opportunity. A trend bar is a breakout, and since most breakout attempts fail, and this one is after a prior sell climax that did not\nhave much of a correction and after a bull trend that has gone on for dozens of bars without a correction, the odds against a crash are very high.\nSmart traders see this as an unusual opportunity to buy when the probability of lower prices is very small, at least for many bars. The bears buy\nback their shorts and the bulls buy new longs. Both buy aggressively at the close of the bar, below its low, at the close of the next bar (especially if it\nis a less strong trend bar or has a body in the opposite direction), and at the close of the following bar.

However, it failed in a two-legged lower high at bar 4. Once the\nmarket broke below the bull channel with the bar 5 pullback, which also broke the major bull trend line, it became obvious that this was not a bull\nspike and channel day and that the market was forming a trading range. This became a triangle top, and then a spike and channel down. Some\ntraders saw the move down to bar 3 as the important bear spike, while others saw the move down to bar 5 as more important. Both spikes were\npart of the selling pressure that resulted in the bears gaining control over the market.\nBar 8 formed a double bottom bull flag with bar 3, and it was the second long entry for the moving average gap bar.

At this point, you\nshould try to take all short entries and consider any longs to be scalps until there is a climactic overshoot of the bear trend channel line and reversal\nup. In general, it is better to ignore the long setups and just trade with the trend when there is a strong bear trend like this. Bar 13 reversed up from\nbreaking three such lines.\nConsecutive climaxes often result in a significant correction, but the odds go down if there is a significant correction after each climax. There was\na sell climax down to bar 3 and another down to bar 5, but the rallies to bars 4 and 7 relieved the selling pressure and reduced the need for a sharp\nreversal up. However, in the bear channel from bar 7 to bar 13, there was no relief from the intense selling that occurred during the climaxes from\nbar 9 to bar 10 and from bar 11 to bar 12. The four-bear trend bar plunge down to bar 13 was the exhaustive sell climax that showed the\ncapitulation of the weak traders. The third sell climax is usually the most dramatic, and it typically has a large bear spike, which overshoots trend\nchannel lines and creates a parabolic bend to the channel. The parabolic slope indicates that the momentum down was increasing as the market\nwas falling, and a parabolic trend usually is in its last stage. The final weak bulls gave up and sold at any price, and the final weak bears finally\njoined the other bears by shorting at the market during the free fall. This was the third consecutive sell climax without a significant break, and\nchannels often end with the third push. The tight channel meant that there was urgency, and the momentum increased on the way down. The move\nto bar 13 collapsed through the trend channel line, which is how many channels end.\nSo what about the strong bulls and bears? They see the climaxes and understand the excess. The strong bears already shorted higher and were\nnot interested in shorting down here. They would short only a significant pullback, maybe near the top of the channel where they originally shorted.\nWith no more strong or weak bears shorting and no more weak bulls exiting, the selling pressure disappeared. The strong bulls saw the collapse\nand stepped aside. They knew that the market was going lower, so there was no incentive for them to buy until they believed that the market was as\nlow as it would go. They wanted to buy at the best price and that was at the bottom. The different institutions each had their own measures of value\nand excess, and when enough of them agreed that the market was a good value, there was enough strong buying for a rally. Also, the strong bears\nunderstood the excess and took profits. Their buying contributed to the rally. They would have considered shorting again if the market was able to\nget back to around the start of the channel, which is where they had shorted earlier and made a profit.\nThe bottom is always at a confluence of magnets. Here, it was just beyond a measured move down from the open of the bull spike at bar 1 to the\nclose of the final bar of the bull spike five bars later. It was also a trend channel line overshoot from a trend channel line drawn across the two swing\nlows of yesterday (not shown), and the bar 13 two-bar reversal up was also the signal for a large, two-day expanding triangle bottom.

They wanted to buy at the best price and that was at the bottom. The different institutions each had their own measures of value and excess, and when enough of them agreed that the market was a good value, there was enough strong buying for a rally. Also, the strong bears understood the excess and took profits. Their buying contributed to the rally. They would have considered shorting again if the market was able to get back to around the start of the channel, which is where they had shorted earlier and made a profit.\nThe bottom is always at a confluence of magnets. Here, it was just beyond a measured move down from the open of the bull spike at bar 1 to the close of the final bar of the bull spike five bars later. It was also a trend channel line overshoot from a trend channel line drawn across the two swing lows of yesterday (not shown), and the bar 13 two-bar reversal up was also the signal for a large, two-day expanding triangle bottom.

The bar 19 bottom was a micro double\nbottom, because the bar before bar 19 traded down and then up into its close.

There was a strong bear spike down to bar 8 and then a one-bar\nlow 1 sell signal.

If\nthere is a reasonable sell signal after about 10 bars, they will look to short again. In this case, the market rallied strongly and the bears saw no sign\nthat it would sell off, so they never saw a sensible setup to short.\nAggressive bulls also thought that the market was likely to rally and they, too, bought.

For example, if there is a wedge top where the third\npush up ends with a strong bear reversal bar, and the next bar trades below the reversal bar, the first target is a test of the bottom of the wedge (the\nbottom of the pullback from the first push up), and the next is a measured move down, based on the height from the bottom to the top of the wedge.\nAll three push patterns are manifestations of the same underlying market behavior, regardless of the shape that the pattern takes. It does not matter\nif it is a wedge, a micro wedge, a parabolic wedge, a wedge with a fourth push, a wedge pullback in a trend or a trading range, a wedge trend\nreversal pattern, another type of triangle (including an expanding triangle), a triple top or bottom, a double top or bottom pullback, a head and\nshoulders top or bottom, or a failed breakout below a double top or above a double bottom. At some point, the trend traders give up trying for a\nstrong breakout, and the reversal traders gain control of the market. A third consecutive reversal is usually enough for that to happen.\nThree-push patterns often contain large trend bars and create consecutive climaxes. If the pushes are strong one- to three-bar spikes, traders will\nsee them as climaxes. For example, if there is a strong bear spike, and a pullback, and then another strong bear spike, traders will wonder if the\npullback is the final flag in the bear trend and if the consecutive sell climaxes will be followed by a bigger pullback. If there is only a small pullback\nfrom the second push down instead of a 10-bar rally, and then there is a third strong bear spike, traders will see this as three consecutive sell\nclimaxes. They know that the odds are 60 percent or better that the market will try to have a more complex correction, like two legs up, that lasts for\nabout 10 or more bars. So, if the pattern has a good signal bar, reasonable shape, adequate buying pressure, and is not a tight bear channel, they\nwill consider buying the reversal up from the third push down.\nWedges can be pullbacks or reversals. Wedge pullbacks are discussed in Chapters 18 and 19 in the second book. When they are pullbacks in\ntrends, they are with-trend setups and it is reasonable to enter on the first signal. A wedge reversal is an attempt to reverse a trend and it is\ntherefore a countertrend setup. In general, it is better to wait for a second signal when trading countertrend. For example, if there is a wedge bottom\nin a bear trend, buy above the signal bar only if the pattern is exceptionally strong. It is usually better to wait to see if the market has a strong bull\nbreakout and then look to buy a pullback, which can be a higher low or even a lower low. If the bull breakout goes straight up for several bars without\na pullback, then traders should trade it like any other breakout, as discussed in the second book. Another difference between wedge pullbacks and\nreversals is their direction. A wedge bull flag points down, whereas a wedge reversal at the top of a bull trend points up. A wedge pullback in a bear\ntrend points up, but a wedge bottom in a bear trend points down. Also, wedge flags are usually smaller patterns, and most last about 10 to 20 bars.\nSince they are with-trend setups, they don’t have to be perfect, and many are subtle and look nothing like a wedge, but have three pullbacks. A\nreversal usually needs to be at least 20 bars long and have a clear trend channel line to be strong enough to reverse a trend.\nTrends often end with a test of the extreme, and the test often has two legs, each reaching a greater extreme (a two-legged higher high in a bull\ntrend or lower low in a bear trend). The first extreme and then those two legs make three pushes, which is a well-recognized reversal setup with\nmany names. Sometimes it takes a wedge shape (an ascending triangle in a bull trend or a descending triangle in a bear trend), but usually it does\nnot. It is not useful for a trader to draw subtle distinctions among the variations because there are enough similarities that they trade the same. For\nsimplicity, think of these three-push patterns as wedges since most of them end in a climactic wedgelike point. Remember, a wedge is simply a\ntrend channel where there are three pushes and often the trend line and trend channel lines converge. A trend line and trend channel line in a three-\npush pattern can be parallel like a stairs pattern, convergent like a wedge, or divergent like an expanding triangle. It does not matter because they\nall behave similarly and you trade them the same. They are all climaxes and frequently have a parabolic shape, which at times can be subtle. For\nexample, if there is a bull wedge and the slope of the trend channel line drawn across the tops of the second and third legs is steeper than the line\ndrawn across the highs of the first two legs, the wedge is parabolic. This is climactic behavior (discussed in the last chapter), and if the market\nreverses down, it will usually do so in about two legs and 10 bars.\nWhen a channel has a wedge shape, it is due to urgency (and if it has a parabolic wedge shape, it is due to extreme urgency), and often leads to\na climactic reversal. For example, in a wedge top, the slope of the trend line is greater than the slope of the trend channel line. The trend line is\nwhere the with-trend traders enter and the countertrend traders exit, and the opposite happens at the trend channel line. So if the slope of the trend\nline is greater, that means that the bulls are buying on smaller pullbacks and the bears are exiting on smaller sell-offs. What first distinguishes a\nwedge from a channel where the lines are parallel is the second pullback. Once the second push up has begun to reverse down, traders can draw a\ntrend channel line and then use it to create a parallel line. When they drag that parallel line to the bottom of the first pullback, they have created a\ntrend line and a trend channel. That tells bulls and bears where support is, and bulls will look to buy there and bears will look to take profits there.\nHowever, if the bulls begin to buy above that level and the bears exit their shorts early, the market will turn back up before it reaches the trend line.\nBoth are doing so because they feel a sense of urgency and are afraid that the market will not drop down to that support level. This means that both\nfeel that the trend line needs to be steeper and that the trend up is stronger.\nOnce the market turns up, traders then redraw the trend line. Instead of using the parallel of the trend channel line, they now can draw a trend line\nusing the bottoms of the first two pullbacks. They now see that it is steeper than the trend channel line above and they begin to believe that the\nmarket is forming a wedge, which they know is often a reversal pattern. Traders will draw a parallel of that new steeper trend line and drag it to the\ntop of the second push up, in case the market is forming a steeper parallel channel instead of a wedge. Both the bulls and the bears will watch to\nsee whether the original trend channel line will contain the rally or the new, steeper one will be reached. If the original one contains the rally and the\nmarket turns down, traders will think that although there was more urgency in the buying on the second pullback, that urgency did not continue on the\nthird push up. The bulls took profits at the original, shallower trend channel line, which means that they exited earlier than they could have. The bulls\nwere hoping that the market would rally to the steeper trend channel line, but are now disappointed. The bears were so eager to short that, afraid\nthat the market would not reach the steeper, higher trend channel line, they began to short at the original line. Now it is the bears who have a sense\nof urgency and the bulls who are afraid. Traders will see the turndown from the wedge top and sell, and most will wait for at least two legs down\nbefore they look for the next major signal up or down.\nOnce the market makes its first leg down, it will break below the wedge. At some point, the bears will take profits and the bulls will buy again. The\nbulls want to cause the wedge top to fail.

Once their profit taking combined with the new selling by the\nbears reaches a critical mass, it will overwhelm the remaining buyers, and the market will turn down for that second leg. At some point, the bulls will\nreturn and the bears will take profits, and both sides will see the two-legged pullback and wonder if the bull trend will resume. At this point, the\nwedge has played itself out and the market will be looking for the next pattern.\nMarkets often reverse after a test of the trend’s extreme. For example, when a bull trend is at its strongest, bulls will buy above the prior high\nsince they believe that there will be a successful breakout and another leg up. However, as the bull trend weakens and gets more two-sided trading,\nthe strong bulls will see a new high as a place to take profits instead of a good location for more longs, and they will buy only on a pullback. As\nselling pressure builds, strong bears will dominate at the next new high and will try to turn this higher high into the top of the rally. If they are able to\npush the market down in a strong bear spike, traders will watch the following rally carefully to see if it reverses down once it gets back up to around\nthe old high. The reversal might come at a lower high, a double top, or a higher high. Most will buy back their shorts if the market rallies to just above\ntheir short entry price or above that higher high. However, they are aware of the possibility of a wedge top, and if the breakout above the second\nhigh does not look too strong, they will look to short again.\nWhen the up and down swings are especially sharp and when the first or second push down doesn’t clearly break below a major bull trend line or\nhold below the moving average, the bears will see the reversal down as weak. However, those two pushes down represent selling pressure, and\nthey tell everyone that the bears might be able to take control of the market. The bears know that the market might need a third push up to exhaust\nitself. However, they saw that they were able to turn the market down at the new high on the second push up and they believe that they might be able\nto do it again. The bulls took profits above the first high and will likely be quicker to take profits as the market goes above the second high. If the bull\ntrend was very strong, the bulls would have bought more on a breakout above the first high. When traders instead see the market sell off, they know\nthat the strong bulls are taking profits instead of buying the breakout, and this tells them that the strong bulls do not believe that the market is going\nup without more of a pullback.\nBoth the bulls and the bears know that markets often reverse after a third push up, and they will need a strong breakout well beyond the second\nhigh for them to believe that the market is not topping. They view the second high as a large low 2 short setup. If the low 2 fails and the breakout\nabove the low 2 top is strong, the market will likely have at least two more legs up. If it is not strong, the market will probably form a wedge top. The\nbreakout above the second high is often sharp, but it will reverse down quickly if the bulls and the bears think that it is forming a top instead of a new\nbreakout. The sharp poke above the second top might be due more to short covering than to aggressive buying by the strong bulls, and if there is\nnot immediate follow-through, traders will assume that the strong bulls will buy only a deep pullback. If the strong bulls are stepping aside, then the\nbears will have the confidence to short aggressively. If they can push the market down far and fast enough, the bulls might wait for a more protracted\nsell-off before looking to buy. This can create a sell vacuum where the market falls quickly until it reaches a price at which traders are willing to buy\nagain (the bulls initiating new longs and the bears taking profits). If the bulls take profits on their new longs on a rally that stalls below the top of the\nwedge, the market will form a lower high and it will likely fall for at least a second push down. The strong bears will be shorting more at the lower\nhigh, exactly where the strong bulls are covering their longs. It will always be at a resistance area where there is a confluence of reasons to sell.\nThese fast reversals that quickly cover a lot of points represent the urgency that everyone is feeling, and this often makes it difficult for traders to\nmake their trading decisions fast enough to get the best entry. However, if traders understand what the market is doing, they can often get short\nvery early in the reversal down. The move down is often fast and they can move their stops to breakeven after the first strong leg down and the\nsubsequent lower high.\nThe majority of three-push patterns reverse after overshooting a trend channel line and that alone can be a reason to enter, even if the actual\nshape is not a wedge. However, the three pushes are often easier to see than is the trend channel line overshoot, and that makes the distinction\nfrom other trend channel line failures worthwhile. These patterns rarely have a perfect shape, and often trend lines and trend channel lines have to\nbe manipulated to highlight the pattern. For example, the wedge might be only with the candle bodies, so to draw the trend line and trend channel\nline in a way to highlight the wedge shape, you have to ignore the tails. Other times, the end point of the wedge won’t reach the trend channel line.\nBe flexible and if there is a three-push pattern at the end of a big move, even if the pattern is not perfect, trade it as if it is a wedge. However, if it\novershoots the trend channel line, the odds of success with the countertrend trade are higher. Also, most trend channel line overshoots have a\nwedge shape, but it is often so stretched out that it is not worth looking at it. The reversal from the overshoot can be reason enough to enter if the\npattern is strong.\nIt is important to remember that a wedge reversal is a countertrend setup. It is therefore usually better to wait for a second entry, like a lower high\n(less often, a higher high breakout pullback short setup) after a wedge top or a higher low (less often, a lower low) after a wedge bottom. This is\nunlike trading wedge pullbacks where you are entering in the direction of the larger trend. Then, entering on the first signal is a reliable approach. In\ngeneral, if you are trading a wedge reversal and it is not as strong as you would like, it is better to wait for a second signal before taking the trade. If\nthe initial breakout is strong, entering on the pullback has a higher chance of success. If there is a wedge reversal in a trading range, it may look\nand act more like a wedge pullback because there is no trend to reverse. When that is the case, taking the first signal is usually a profitable\napproach.\nIf a wedge triggers an entry, but then it fails and the market extends one or more ticks beyond the wedge extreme, it will often run quickly to a\nmeasured move based on the height of the wedge. Sometimes, just after failing, it reverses back and creates a second attempt at reversing the\ntrend; when this happens, the new trend is usually protracted (lasting at least 10 bars) and it usually has at least two legs. The new extreme can be\nthought of as a breakout pullback. For example, if there is a wedge top that begins to reverse down and the downside breakout fails and then the\nbull trend resumes and reverses down again at a new high, that new high is a higher high pullback from the initial break below the wedge.\nWhen the wedge reversal fails and the market reaches a new extreme, watch to see if the market reverses on this fourth push. Sometimes what\nappears to be a fourth push is really just a third push in the eyes of most traders. If, after the pullback from the first push, the market creates an\nespecially strong second push, many traders will reset the count and consider it to be the new first push. The result is that many traders won’t look\nfor a reversal after the third push and instead will wait for the fourth push before looking for a reversal trade. In hindsight, the decision about whether\nmost traders reset the count is clear, but when you are trading, you cannot always be certain. The stronger the momentum is on the second push,\nthe more likely it is that the market will have reset the count and the more likely it is that there will be a fourth push.\nAfter the first leg of any new trend, the test of the old extreme sometimes assumes a wedge shape, and the wedge pullback from that first leg of\nthe new trend may or may not exceed the extreme of the old trend. In either case, a trader should be looking to enter in the possible new trend as\nthe wedge pullback reverses back in the direction of the new trend (for example, in a new bull trend, the wedge pullback can be a higher low or a\nlower low).\nWhen there is a trend in the first hour, the market often has a trading range that lasts for several hours, followed by a resumption of the trend into\nthe close. That trading range will often have three pushes, but usually not a wedge shape. For example, in a trend-resumption bear trend day, the\n", "text_clean": "profits, they believe that they will be unable to push the market above the old high.

At this point, the wedge has played itself out and the market will be looking for the next pattern.\nMarkets often reverse after a test of the trend’s extreme. For example, when a bull trend is at its strongest, bulls will buy above the prior high since they believe that there will be a successful breakout and another leg up. However, as the bull trend weakens and gets more two-sided trading, the strong bulls will see a new high as a place to take profits instead of a good location for more longs, and they will buy only on a pullback. As selling pressure builds, strong bears will dominate at the next new high and will try to turn this higher high into the top of the rally. If they are able to push the market down in a strong bear spike, traders will watch the following rally carefully to see if it reverses down once it gets back up to around the old high. The reversal might come at a lower high, a double top, or a higher high. Most will buy back their shorts if the market rallies to just above their short entry price or above that higher high. However, they are aware of the possibility of a wedge top, and if the breakout above the second high does not look too strong, they will look to short again.\nWhen the up and down swings are especially sharp and when the first or second push down doesn’t clearly break below a major bull trend line or hold below the moving average, the bears will see the reversal down as weak.

It does not matter whether you\ncall it a low 3 short setup or a wedge, but it is important to be aware that the day might have a bear trend resumption into the close and that this\nthree-push, low-momentum rally might be the setup for the short. View this as a type of wedge because it has three pushes, there is often a trend\nchannel line overshoot, it sometimes has the shape of a wedge, and it has the same behavior as a wedge. Remember, if you see everything in\nshades of gray, you will be a much better trader.\nWhen there are three or more pushes and each breakout is smaller, then this is a shrinking stairs pattern in addition to being a wedge. For\nexample, if there are three pushes up in a bull trend and the second push was 10 ticks above the first and the third was only seven ticks above the\nsecond, then this is a shrinking stairs pattern. It is a sign of waning momentum and increases the odds that there will be a two-legged reversal. The\nbulls are taking profits sooner and the bears are shorting at less of a breakout than last time because they believe the market might not break out\nas much this time. Sometimes there will be a fourth or fifth step in a strong trend, but since the momentum is waning, countertrend trades can\nusually be taken. In contrast, if the third step is significantly beyond the second and then reverses, this is likely to become a trend channel line\novershoot and reversal setup.\nA wedge top fails if, after triggering the entry, the breakout fails to go far and the trend resumes and goes beyond the wedge. For example, if\nthere is a wedge top and the market falls below the signal bar and triggers a short entry, but this is soon followed by a rally that goes above the top\nof the wedge, then the wedge has failed. When traders are unclear about whether the second push up was strong enough to reset the count, they\nwill watch to see if the breakout is actually the third push of the wedge that began with that second push. When a wedge is very clear and traders\nwere expecting the top to hold, many traders will reverse to long on a stop above the top of the wedge. When a wedge top succeeds, the first target\nis a test of the bottom of the wedge, and the next target is a measured move down from there. When a wedge top fails, the first target is a\nmeasured move up, again using the height of the wedge. Remember, a wedge is an area of two-sided trading, so it acts like a trading range and\ntherefore sets up a breakout mode situation. Whether the breakout is above or below, the target is a measured move equal to about the height of\nthe wedge. As with any breakout, it could fail. For example, if the wedge top triggers, but the market quickly reverses back up and breaks out above\nthe wedge top, the wedge has failed. However, the bull breakout should be viewed like any other breakout. If it is strong, it is likely to be followed by\na measured move up. If it is weak, it will likely fail and the market will reverse back down. If that happens, the bull breakout above the wedge\nbecomes simply a higher high pullback from the original breakout below the wedge.\nIn the Emini, if there is a wedge top and then a brief sell-off, the pullback often tests the top of the wedge to the exact tick, forming a perfect\ndouble top. If the market reverses back down, this is a second-entry short opportunity. In the SPY and in many stocks, the pullback will sometimes\ngo above the wedge by a few ticks and traders will not see this as a failure. However, if it races above the wedge by many ticks, this is a sign that\ntraders are buying aggressively and they are looking for a strong leg up and no longer looking for a top. When this is happening, look to buy quickly\nto catch this fast breakout. Most wedge tops that fail are very steep and tight and occur in strong bull trends. When a bull trend is strong, it will\nalways be forming trend channel line overshoots and three-push patterns, but the pullbacks between the pushes are small and the pushes are very\nstrong. It is a mistake to be looking for reversals in strong trends, because most reversal attempts fail. Instead of seeing everything as a possible\nwedge top, look to buy the pullback from each new high. Also, wedge tops in strong bull trends often correct in two sideways legs to the moving\naverage, setting up a high 2 buy. This is a reliable entry. A wedge that corrects sideways is a sign that the trend is very strong. The opposite is true\nfor wedge bottoms. As with any breakout, the breakout could fail. For example, if the wedge top triggers, but the market quickly reverses back up\nand breaks out above the wedge top, the wedge has failed. However, the bull breakout should be viewed like any other breakout. If it is strong, it is\nlikely to be followed by a measured move up. If it is weak, it will likely fail and the market will reverse back down. If that happens, the bull breakout\nabove the wedge becomes simply a higher high pullback from the original breakout below the wedge.\nWedges most often fail when traders are overly eager to enter countertrend, do not wait for a clear trend line break and countertrend strength,\nand fade the first small three-push pattern that appears. Three pushes alone, especially when small, will rarely reverse a trend in the absence of a\nprior trend line break or a major trend channel overshoot and reversal. If the channel is tight, even if it has a wedge shape, it is almost always better\nnot to enter on the reversal. Instead, wait for the reversal and see how strong the breakout is. If it is strong, trade it like any other breakout. It is\nusually best to enter on a breakout pullback, but when the spike is very strong, traders will enter on the closes of the bars and at the market. If the\nbreakout is weak, traders assume that it will fail and they look for the channel to continue. They will then enter in the direction of the wedge channel\nand not in the countertrend direction. For example, if there is a wedge bottom in a bear trend but the upside breakout is weak, traders will look to\nshort the low 1 or low 2 that is created by the failed upside breakout. These smart traders will enter where the countertrend traders will be taking\ntheir losses.\nWedges are often opening reversal patterns. Opening reversals can follow very strong moves in the first hour or so, and sometimes there will be\na very steep wedge with only slight pauses after the first two pushes, yet the market will abruptly reverse and trend for the rest of the day. The first\npause might be a small final flag, and then there is an even smaller final flag after the second push. Although you should never look for a reversal\nfrom such a steep, tight wedge after the first hour or two, they can be reliable opening reversal setups.\nA micro wedge is a wedge that is formed by three consecutive bars or three out of four or five consecutive bars. Since the pattern is so small, it\nusually results in only a minor correction. Usually the bars have tails and a micro trend channel line can be drawn across those tails, and there\nusually is a clear wedge on a smaller time frame like a 1 minute chart. For example, if the market is selling off and has a bear trend bar with a\nmoderate tail on the bottom, and this is followed by another bear trend bar with a slightly lower low and an obvious tail on the bottom, and then by a\nthird bar with a lower low and a tail, this is a micro wedge reversal pattern. If the bear trend is strong, you should not buy above the high of the third\nbar, because it will likely lead to a loss. If the micro wedge forms in a trading range day near the bottom of the range and the third bar is a bull\nreversal bar, this might be a reasonable setup for a buy scalp.\nThere is a special type of wedge that is really just a three-push pattern and usually does not have a wedge shape, but it is important because it is\na reliable breakout setup. If the market is in a trading range and then has a one-tick breakout beyond a minor swing high or low that reverses for\nmaybe three to 20 bars, and then the market again has another one-tick or sometimes a two-tick breakout that once again pulls back, those three\npushes set up the pattern. If the market then breaks again beyond that second minor breakout, it usually leads to a significant breakout and an\napproximate measured move equal to the height of the pattern. It is as if the three pushes constitute a wedge, and then, instead of leading to a\nreversal, the wedge failed. As is the case with all failed wedges, the market typically breaks out and runs for about the same number of points as\nthere are from the bottom to the top of the wedge. Sometimes the market breaks out after only going beyond a single one-tick failure.\nA related pattern is a failed double top or bottom breakout. For example, if there is a double top and then the market breaks above the double\ntop but reverses back down within a few bars, this can function like a wedge top (a wedge is a type of triangle, and some traders would call it a\ntriangle). The first two pushes up are the highs of the double top, and the third push up is the breakout above the double top. If the market reverses\ndown, it will usually go far enough for at least a scalp. A double top is a trading range, and the failed breakout is just a failed breakout of a trading\n", "text_clean": "trading range might be a bear channel that slopes up slightly, and it might have three pushes but not a wedge shape. It does not matter whether you call it a low 3 short setup or a wedge, but it is important to be aware that the day might have a bear trend resumption into the close and that this three-push, low-momentum rally might be the setup for the short. View this as a type of wedge because it has three pushes, there is often a trend channel line overshoot, it sometimes has the shape of a wedge, and it has the same behavior as a wedge. Remember, if you see everything in shades of gray, you will be a much better trader.\nWhen there are three or more pushes and each breakout is smaller, then this is a shrinking stairs pattern in addition to being a wedge. For example, if there are three pushes up in a bull trend and the second push was 10 ticks above the first and the third was only seven ticks above the second, then this is a shrinking stairs pattern. It is a sign of waning momentum and increases the odds that there will be a two-legged reversal. The bulls are taking profits sooner and the bears are shorting at less of a breakout than last time because they believe the market might not break out as much this time. Sometimes there will be a fourth or fifth step in a strong trend, but since the momentum is waning, countertrend trades can usually be taken. In contrast, if the third step is significantly beyond the second and then reverses, this is likely to become a trend channel line overshoot and reversal setup.\nA wedge top fails if, after triggering the entry, the breakout fails to go far and the trend resumes and goes beyond the wedge. For example, if there is a wedge top and the market falls below the signal bar and triggers a short entry, but this is soon followed by a rally that goes above the top of the wedge, then the wedge has failed.

Also, wedge tops in strong bull trends often correct in two sideways legs to the moving average, setting up a high 2 buy. This is a reliable entry. A wedge that corrects sideways is a sign that the trend is very strong. The opposite is true for wedge bottoms. As with any breakout, the breakout could fail. For example, if the wedge top triggers, but the market quickly reverses back up and breaks out above the wedge top, the wedge has failed. However, the bull breakout should be viewed like any other breakout. If it is strong, it is likely to be followed by a measured move up. If it is weak, it will likely fail and the market will reverse back down. If that happens, the bull breakout above the wedge becomes simply a higher high pullback from the original breakout below the wedge.\nWedges most often fail when traders are overly eager to enter countertrend, do not wait for a clear trend line break and countertrend strength, and fade the first small three-push pattern that appears. Three pushes alone, especially when small, will rarely reverse a trend in the absence of a prior trend line break or a major trend channel overshoot and reversal. If the channel is tight, even if it has a wedge shape, it is almost always better not to enter on the reversal. Instead, wait for the reversal and see how strong the breakout is. If it is strong, trade it like any other breakout. It is usually best to enter on a breakout pullback, but when the spike is very strong, traders will enter on the closes of the bars and at the market. If the breakout is weak, traders assume that it will fail and they look for the channel to continue. They will then enter in the direction of the wedge channel and not in the countertrend direction. For example, if there is a wedge bottom in a bear trend but the upside breakout is weak, traders will look to short the low 1 or low 2 that is created by the failed upside breakout. These smart traders will enter where the countertrend traders will be taking their losses.\nWedges are often opening reversal patterns. Opening reversals can follow very strong moves in the first hour or so, and sometimes there will be a very steep wedge with only slight pauses after the first two pushes, yet the market will abruptly reverse and trend for the rest of the day. The first pause might be a small final flag, and then there is an even smaller final flag after the second push. Although you should never look for a reversal from such a steep, tight wedge after the first hour or two, they can be reliable opening reversal setups.\nA micro wedge is a wedge that is formed by three consecutive bars or three out of four or five consecutive bars. Since the pattern is so small, it usually results in only a minor correction. Usually the bars have tails and a micro trend channel line can be drawn across those tails, and there usually is a clear wedge on a smaller time frame like a 1 minute chart. For example, if the market is selling off and has a bear trend bar with a moderate tail on the bottom, and this is followed by another bear trend bar with a slightly lower low and an obvious tail on the bottom, and then by a third bar with a lower low and a tail, this is a micro wedge reversal pattern. If the bear trend is strong, you should not buy above the high of the third bar, because it will likely lead to a loss. If the micro wedge forms in a trading range day near the bottom of the range and the third bar is a bull reversal bar, this might be a reasonable setup for a buy scalp.\nThere is a special type of wedge that is really just a three-push pattern and usually does not have a wedge shape, but it is important because it is a reliable breakout setup. If the market is in a trading range and then has a one-tick breakout beyond a minor swing high or low that reverses for maybe three to 20 bars, and then the market again has another one-tick or sometimes a two-tick breakout that once again pulls back, those three pushes set up the pattern. If the market then breaks again beyond that second minor breakout, it usually leads to a significant breakout and an approximate measured move equal to the height of the pattern. It is as if the three pushes constitute a wedge, and then, instead of leading to a reversal, the wedge failed. As is the case with all failed wedges, the market typically breaks out and runs for about the same number of points as there are from the bottom to the top of the wedge. Sometimes the market breaks out after only going beyond a single one-tick failure.\nA related pattern is a failed double top or bottom breakout. For example, if there is a double top and then the market breaks above the double top but reverses back down within a few bars, this can function like a wedge top (a wedge is a type of triangle, and some traders would call it a triangle). The first two pushes up are the highs of the double top, and the third push up is the breakout above the double top. If the market reverses down, it will usually go far enough for at least a scalp.

Others saw bar 7 as\na two-legged lower high major trend reversal and therefore a low 2 short setup, with the first leg up being the rally after bar 5. Still others saw the\nthree small pushes up to bar 7 as a small channel that followed the small spike up from bar 6.

The channel up to bar 4 had\nthree pushes in the final segment and again was in a tight bull channel. When the channel is tight, bears should not short the reversal down from the\nthird push up. They should wait to see how strong the bear breakout is.\nBar 1 was a strong bear spike, and many traders then shorted the higher high at bar 2, which they saw as a higher high pullback from the bear\nbreakout down to bar 1. Bar 1 broke the bull trend line, so traders were looking to short a higher high or lower high test of the bull high.\nThe bar 5 breakout of the bull channel was strong enough to clearly break the bull trend line, so traders were looking to short the breakout\npullback. It was a lower high at bar 7, which formed a double top with the small rally after bar 5. Most trading ranges in bull trends become bull flags\nand are just pullbacks on higher time frame charts. Although the market did not have to reverse up from bar 3, that was the most likely outcome,\nsince bar 3 was at the bottom of a trading range in a bull trend. The market could have continued to fall from the lower high major trend reversal that\nformed after bar 2 (there was a double top bear flag and lower high), but most major trend reversals are followed by trading ranges and not actual\nreversals into opposite trends.

{"book": "REVERSAL", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\reversal3.pdf", "page_index": 78, "text_raw": "obvious). The reason moves end at targets is that most trades are being done by computers, and their algorithms are based on math and logic.\nThey only buy at support and sell at resistance. These potential levels are usually visible to experienced traders.\nThe trend channel line from bar 4 to bar 7 was steeper than the one from bar 2 to bar 4, which means that the move up was parabolic. The bar\nbefore bar 7 had a big tail, which usually means that traders who bought the close of that bar were looking for just a scalp up and then a pullback.\nThe high of bar 7 was a second push up. The next bar was a bear inside bar and the signal bar for the short. With that much strength after the failed\nlow 2 at bar 4, most traders correctly assumed that there would be a second push up, which happens in over 60 percent of the cases. The market\npulled back for six bars in a bull flag (here, a bear micro channel), but instead of breaking out to the upside, the flag broke to the downside on the\nbar after bar 8. This bull flag was then the final flag of the rally, and its downside breakout was a final flag reversal, even though the flag never had an\nupside breakout. Astute traders were aware of this possibility and shorted below the bear bar that followed bar 7, and on the breakout below bar 8.\nThe traders who took the first entry knew that it had only about a 40 percent chance of success, but they were looking for a reversal down and a\nreward that was at least twice the size of their risk, and therefore had a positive trader’s equation. The traders who shorted on the downside\nbreakout, either as the bar was forming or on its close, or on the close of any of the following bars, had proof that the market was going down, and\ntherefore their shorts had at least a 60 percent chance of success (for them, they wanted a reward that was at least as large as their risk). They\ntraded off a smaller profit for a higher probability, and their trader’s equation was also positive.\nThe chart on the right is a parabolic wedge bottom. Bar 15 was a strong bull reversal bar at a double bottom, and a buy setup for a reversal up\nfrom the low 2 final flag that broke out below bar 14. Bar 14 can be viewed as a second entry low 2 short, a breakout pullback from the low 2 short\nthat triggered on the prior bar, or as a triangle short (the three pushes up were the high of the doji that formed two bars after bar 13, the bull inside\nbar that followed, and the tail at the top of bar 14). The bears saw bar 16 as a pullback from the breakout of the bear triangle. Both bulls and bears\nsold below bar 16, the bull entry bar after bar 15, and the bar 15 buy signal bar. The bulls were exiting their longs and the bears were initiating\nshorts. When bulls get stopped out of a bull reversal up from a double bottom, they often expect a breakout and measured move, and don’t look to\nbuy again for at least a couple of bars. This allowed the market to fall quickly.\nBar 17 had a tail on the bottom, which alerted traders that the market might have only one more push down before forming a pullback. It also had\na close in the middle, which made it a reversal bar, although weak. This was the first attempt to reverse up from a spike, which is a type of micro\nchannel, and first attempts to reverse usually fail. There were more sellers above bar 17 than buyers, as expected. Scalpers shorted the close of\nbar 17, hoping for one more small push down before a pullback began. Because only a scalp down was likely, shorting the low 1 below the next bar\nwas risky. The market turned up in a small double bottom at bar 18 (bar 17 was the first push down). The low of bar 18 was four ticks below the\nclose of bar 17, so most of those shorts from the close of that bar were trapped and bought back their shorts above bar 18. Bar 18 had a strong bull\nbody and most traders expected a reversal up to around the moving average and maybe to the high of bar 15. Bar 15 was a reasonable buy signal,\nso some bulls scaled in lower and planned to exit their entire position at their first entry, which was the high of bar 15. The bulls thought that the rally\ncould reach the bar 16 or bar 14 highs. The bar 18 low was at one or more support levels, although none are shown here.\nThe move down to bar 18 went beyond a reasonable measured move target, which meant that the computers were looking at something else.\nMost measured move targets do not lead to reversals, but it is still helpful to draw them, because all reversals happen at support and resistance\nlevels. When a reversal happens at one of these levels, and the level is especially obvious, it is a good place for trend traders to take profits and\noften a reasonable place for countertrend traders to take reversal trades. The final low of the day was also at a support level, whether or not it was\nobvious. The low of bar 21 was one tick below the earlier low of the day and the close of bar 21 was exactly at the open of the day.\nBecause the move up was a climactic reversal, it had about a 60 percent chance of having at least two legs up and lasting 10 bars. This means\nthat it had a 40 percent chance of not reaching those goals.\nSince bar 18 was a reasonably strong buy signal, most traders entered above its high. This left fewer traders to buy as the market went up. The\ntail on the top of bar 18 and the doji bar that followed were signs that the market lacked urgency for the bulls, which means that the buy setup was\nnot as strong as it could have been. When the bulls fail to create signs of strength, traders are quicker to take profits. Bar 19 reached 14 ticks\nabove the bar 18 high and had a bear close. This means that many bulls took profits at exactly three points. Instead of finding new buyers as the\nmarket rallied, it found profit takers at the moving average, and two ticks below the low 2 short that was triggered two bars after bar 13. The bears\nsaw this as a breakout test that missed the breakeven stops by one tick, and therefore a sign that the bears were aggressively defending their\nstops. Although the odds still favored a second leg up after a pullback to a higher low, most bulls exited their longs during and below bar 19, and\nwere only looking to buy again on a stop above the high of a bar in the pullback. The higher low never formed and the market fell below the bar 17\nbear spike low and closed on the low of the day. The bulls did not get as much profit as they had hoped to make when they took their trade, but this\noften happens and is not a surprise. Traders always have a plan when they enter a trade, but if the premise changes, they change their plan. Many\ntrades end up with smaller profits or losses than what traders expected when they entered. Good traders just take what the market gives them and\nthen move on to the next trade.\nTraders were especially wary of the possibility of a sell-off into the close of the day, because the market had a bear breakout on the daily chart\ntwo days earlier after rallying for two years. When a market might be reversing down on the daily chart, many traders look for a sell-off into the close\n(just like they look for a rally into the close in a bull trend). This made traders unwilling to buy on limit orders as the market traded down below bar\n19. They were cautious and only wanted to buy after a reversal bar formed. With so few traders willing to buy on limit orders as the market was\nselling off into the close on a bear day, the higher low signal bar never formed.\nFIGURE 5.9 Failed Wedge\n", "text_clean": "obvious). The reason moves end at targets is that most trades are being done by computers, and their algorithms are based on math and logic.\nThey only buy at support and sell at resistance. These potential levels are usually visible to experienced traders.\nThe trend channel line from bar 4 to bar 7 was steeper than the one from bar 2 to bar 4, which means that the move up was parabolic. The bar before bar 7 had a big tail, which usually means that traders who bought the close of that bar were looking for just a scalp up and then a pullback.\nThe high of bar 7 was a second push up. The next bar was a bear inside bar and the signal bar for the short. With that much strength after the failed low 2 at bar 4, most traders correctly assumed that there would be a second push up, which happens in over 60 percent of the cases. The market pulled back for six bars in a bull flag (here, a bear micro channel), but instead of breaking out to the upside, the flag broke to the downside on the bar after bar 8. This bull flag was then the final flag of the rally, and its downside breakout was a final flag reversal, even though the flag never had an upside breakout. Astute traders were aware of this possibility and shorted below the bear bar that followed bar 7, and on the breakout below bar 8.\nThe traders who took the first entry knew that it had only about a 40 percent chance of success, but they were looking for a reversal down and a reward that was at least twice the size of their risk, and therefore had a positive trader’s equation. The traders who shorted on the downside breakout, either as the bar was forming or on its close, or on the close of any of the following bars, had proof that the market was going down, and therefore their shorts had at least a 60 percent chance of success (for them, they wanted a reward that was at least as large as their risk). They traded off a smaller profit for a higher probability, and their trader’s equation was also positive.\nThe chart on the right is a parabolic wedge bottom. Bar 15 was a strong bull reversal bar at a double bottom, and a buy setup for a reversal up from the low 2 final flag that broke out below bar 14. Bar 14 can be viewed as a second entry low 2 short, a breakout pullback from the low 2 short that triggered on the prior bar, or as a triangle short (the three pushes up were the high of the doji that formed two bars after bar 13, the bull inside bar that followed, and the tail at the top of bar 14). The bears saw bar 16 as a pullback from the breakout of the bear triangle. Both bulls and bears sold below bar 16, the bull entry bar after bar 15, and the bar 15 buy signal bar. The bulls were exiting their longs and the bears were initiating shorts. When bulls get stopped out of a bull reversal up from a double bottom, they often expect a breakout and measured move, and don’t look to buy again for at least a couple of bars. This allowed the market to fall quickly.\nBar 17 had a tail on the bottom, which alerted traders that the market might have only one more push down before forming a pullback. It also had a close in the middle, which made it a reversal bar, although weak. This was the first attempt to reverse up from a spike, which is a type of micro channel, and first attempts to reverse usually fail. There were more sellers above bar 17 than buyers, as expected. Scalpers shorted the close of bar 17, hoping for one more small push down before a pullback began. Because only a scalp down was likely, shorting the low 1 below the next bar was risky. The market turned up in a small double bottom at bar 18 (bar 17 was the first push down). The low of bar 18 was four ticks below the close of bar 17, so most of those shorts from the close of that bar were trapped and bought back their shorts above bar 18. Bar 18 had a strong bull body and most traders expected a reversal up to around the moving average and maybe to the high of bar 15. Bar 15 was a reasonable buy signal, so some bulls scaled in lower and planned to exit their entire position at their first entry, which was the high of bar 15. The bulls thought that the rally could reach the bar 16 or bar 14 highs. The bar 18 low was at one or more support levels, although none are shown here.\nThe move down to bar 18 went beyond a reasonable measured move target, which meant that the computers were looking at something else.\nMost measured move targets do not lead to reversals, but it is still helpful to draw them, because all reversals happen at support and resistance levels. When a reversal happens at one of these levels, and the level is especially obvious, it is a good place for trend traders to take profits and often a reasonable place for countertrend traders to take reversal trades. The final low of the day was also at a support level, whether or not it was obvious. The low of bar 21 was one tick below the earlier low of the day and the close of bar 21 was exactly at the open of the day.\nBecause the move up was a climactic reversal, it had about a 60 percent chance of having at least two legs up and lasting 10 bars. This means that it had a 40 percent chance of not reaching those goals.\nSince bar 18 was a reasonably strong buy signal, most traders entered above its high. This left fewer traders to buy as the market went up. The tail on the top of bar 18 and the doji bar that followed were signs that the market lacked urgency for the bulls, which means that the buy setup was not as strong as it could have been. When the bulls fail to create signs of strength, traders are quicker to take profits. Bar 19 reached 14 ticks above the bar 18 high and had a bear close. This means that many bulls took profits at exactly three points. Instead of finding new buyers as the market rallied, it found profit takers at the moving average, and two ticks below the low 2 short that was triggered two bars after bar 13. The bears saw this as a breakout test that missed the breakeven stops by one tick, and therefore a sign that the bears were aggressively defending their stops. Although the odds still favored a second leg up after a pullback to a higher low, most bulls exited their longs during and below bar 19, and were only looking to buy again on a stop above the high of a bar in the pullback. The higher low never formed and the market fell below the bar 17 bear spike low and closed on the low of the day. The bulls did not get as much profit as they had hoped to make when they took their trade, but this often happens and is not a surprise. Traders always have a plan when they enter a trade, but if the premise changes, they change their plan. Many trades end up with smaller profits or losses than what traders expected when they entered.

Part of its strength comes from its trapping traders on each new breakout. Since it is a triangle, it is a trading\nrange, and most breakout attempts in a trading range fail. This tendency results in the expanding triangle. In a bullish reversal (an expanding\ntriangle bottom), it has enough strength to rally above the last higher high, trapping longs in; it then collapses to a third low, trapping longs out and\nbears in on the lower low, and then reverses up, forcing both sides to chase the market up. The new low is the third push down and can be thought\nof as a type of three-push pattern, and it can also be thought of as a breakout pullback—the market broke above the last swing high and then pulled\nback to a lower low. In a bear reversal (an expanding triangle top), it does the opposite. Bears are trapped in by a lower low then are forced out,\nand bulls get trapped in by a higher high, and both then have to chase the market as it reverses down for the final time. The initial target is a\nbreakout beyond the opposite side of the triangle, where the market often tries to reverse again. If it succeeds, then the reversal fails, and the\npattern becomes a continuation pattern in the original trend.\nFor example, if there is an expanding triangle top (a reversal pattern) in a bull trend, the first objective is a breakout below the pattern; in most\ncases, that is as far as the trade goes. If the breakout succeeds, the next objective in the reversal down is a measured move that is approximately\nthe same height as the last leg up in the triangle. If the breakout fails and the market reverses up, then the triangle becomes a continuation pattern,\nwhich in this case would be an expanding triangle bull flag, since it is a triangle in a bull trend. The initial target would be a new high, and usually that\nis about as far as the trade goes. If the breakout succeeds, the next target is a measured move up that is about the size of the last leg down in the\ntriangle. If the breakout fails and the market turns down, it is now a larger expanding triangle top with seven legs instead of the original five. At some\npoint, either a breakout succeeds and the market makes an approximate measured move or the triangle evolves into a larger trading range.\nThe term triangle is misleading, because the pattern often does not look anything like a triangle. The salient point is that it is a series of\nprogressively greater higher highs and lower lows that continue to trap breakout traders, and at some point they capitulate and then all of the\ntraders are on the same side, creating a trend. It has three pushes and can be viewed as a variation of a three-push reversal pattern, but with deep\npullbacks. For example, in a bull reversal at the bottom of a bear trend, both pullbacks form higher highs; however, in a conventional three-push\npattern like a wedge bottom (a contracting triangle that is pointing down), both pullbacks would form lower highs (i.e., not an expanding pattern).\nAll expanding triangles are variants of major trend reversals, because the final reversal always follows a strong leg. For example, in an expanding\ntriangle bottom, the rally from the final low follows a rally that was strong enough to go above a prior swing high, and that rally always breaks some\nsignificant bear trend line. At a minimum, the rally from the second push down breaks above the bear trend line that contained that second leg\ndown, and the third push down is therefore a lower low major trend reversal buy setup. The rally to the first or second leg usually also breaks above\nsome other major bear trend line.\nFIGURE 6.1 Expanding Triangle Bottom in the Emini\nAn expanding triangle bottom in a bear trend often later tries to become an expanding triangle bear flag.

The first objective was a new\nswing high, which was reached at bar 7. Then the market usually tries to form an expanding triangle bear flag, which is a continuation pattern since\nit is a trading range in a bear trend.

Final flag reversals are common because every reversal follows\nsome kind of flag and therefore is a type of final flag reversal. If a trader understands what makes a flag likely to be the last one before the trend\nreverses, he is in a position to anticipate and trade the trend reversal.\nHere are several characteristics that are common in final flags:\nThe flag occurs in a trend that has gone on for dozens of bars; therefore the trend traders might begin to take profits and the\ncountertrend traders might become more aggressive. Both will believe that the trend is overdone and is therefore prone to have a larger\ntwo-legged correction and evolve into a larger trading range or even a reversal.\nThe flag is mostly horizontal and has signs of strong two-sided trading, such as several trend bars in the opposite direction, bars with\nprominent tails, several reversals, and bars that overlap the previous bar by at least 50 percent. Part IV in book 2 on trading ranges\ngives more signs of two-sided trading.\nA micro trend line breakout pullback is of a one-bar or micro final flag. For example, when there is a break above a bear micro trend line\nand the market reverses down, that one- or two-bar breakout often becomes the final bear flag in the micro bear trend. If the sell-off fails\nwithin a bar or two and then the market reverses back up from a lower low, double bottom, or higher low, this last sell-off is the breakout\npullback and the original small breakout becomes the final flag in the micro bear trend. If there is a reversal after breaking out of a final\nflag, but it only pulls back for a few bars and then the trend resumes, the pullback has become a breakout pullback in an ongoing trend\ninstead of a reversal, and the final flag has failed to reverse the market.\nFinal flags sometimes reverse briefly only to form a larger flag, which can break out or reverse. You will usually be able to make a\nscalper’s profit off the final flag reversal entry before the evolution takes place, and the evolved pattern will typically result in another\nsignal in either direction.\nSometimes there will be two consecutive horizontal flags with the second one being smaller, and the breakout from the second one can\nlead to a wedge reversal.\nIf the final flag forms after a climax, the failed breakout may not exceed the prior trend extreme. For example, if there is a bear climax\nand then a horizontal trading range above the low, this could become a final flag with the breakout reversing up after either a higher low\nor a lower low.\nSometimes a final flag can be only one or two bars long and develop after a strong spike that is composed of several unusually large\ntrend bars (a potential exhaustive climax). The breakout from that small flag often reverses after a bar or two and usually results in a two-\nlegged pullback that lasts for 10 bars or more. This is a tradable countertrend setup, but it does not reliably lead to a trend reversal. The\nstrong momentum demonstrated by those large trend bars frequently is followed by a test of the trend extreme within 10 to 20 bars. The\none-bar final flag can be any type of pause bar. For example, if the market just had two consecutive sell climaxes, and the next bar is a\nbull doji, even if its low is below the low of the sell climax, the doji can become the final flag in the bear trend. If the next bar or two is a\nlarge bear spike and then the market reverses up, the pause bar is a one-bar final flag.\nTight trading ranges often become final flags. Any sideways trading has a magnetic pull. Since breakouts usually fail, the market usually\ngets drawn back into the range where both bulls and bears agree that there is value.\nSometimes there is no breakout, and the final flag just grows into a new trend. This often happens as a reversal after consecutive\nclimaxes.\nTraders see that the market is overdone and expect a correction soon, but think that the breakout will go far enough for one more scalp.\nThey therefore enter on the breakout of the potential final flag, but are looking to exit soon after entering, rather than being willing to hold\nfor a swing. With everyone looking to take small profits, the breakout quickly reverses.\nWhen you look at any chart where there is a trend reversal, you see that the trend was made up of a series of spikes and pullbacks, which are\nflags. If you study the final flag in that trend, you will discover that it gave clues that the trend was about to end and become either a trading range or\nan opposite trend. The trading range can have protracted legs and appear to be a trend reversal, but usually becomes just a large pullback on a\nhigher time frame chart. However, those legs are usually big enough for a profitable swing trade. Traders are not certain if the reversal will be a new\ntrend or a large correction, and they trade both the same way. They take partial or full profits after the first or second leg and look to add on during a\npullback. If there is a strong move in the direction of the original trend, they might hold on to their position for a test of the old trend’s extreme.\nEvery pullback has two-sided trading, but when the pullback is mostly horizontal, has many bars that largely overlap, has several reversals within\nthe range, and has several bars with bodies in the direction opposite to the trend, then the two-sided trading is especially pronounced. The final flag\ncan be a trading range of any size, including just a single bar, although it usually has at least five to 10 bars. The two-sided trading means that both\nthe bulls and the bears agree that there is value at this level to initiate trades. The bears are shorting aggressively because they believe that the\ntrading range will break to the downside, and the bulls are buying aggressively because they believe that the breakout will be to the upside.\nWhenever the price drifts to the top of the trading range or breaks out of the top of the range and runs for several bars, the bears see it as an even\nbetter value, and they short even more strongly. The bulls see the top of the range as a little expensive, and they buy less. This results in the bears\nbeing able to push the price back down. When it gets to the bottom of the range or has a downside breakout, the opposite happens and the bulls\nthink that the value is even better, but the bears think that it is getting too low to short heavily. This makes the market work back up into the middle of\nthe range. The same process takes place in all trading ranges, including bull and bear flags, and the result is that there is a magnetic effect in the\nmiddle of these trading ranges, and most breakout attempts do not go far before the market is pulled back into the trading range.\nWhen one develops after a trend has gone on for a few dozen bars, it often becomes the final flag in the trend. After the breakout, the with-trend\ntraders are more interested in taking profits and waiting for a deep correction before entering again, and the countertrend traders will fade the\nattempt at trend resumption since they expect at least a two-legged correction. For example, if there is a bull trend that has been going on for\ndozens of bars and it might be ready for a larger correction or even a reversal, traders will watch to see if it forms a bull flag that is mostly horizontal.\n", "text_clean": "CHAPTER 7\nFinal Flags Once a trend ends, traders can look at the chart and see the final flag in the trend.

The bears who were shorting\nduring the flag will buy back their shorts. Their buying contributes to the move up, but they are eager to short again once the market reaches some\nresistance level, which might be a fixed number of ticks where they think the bulls will scalp out of longs or might be some measured move target.\nThe bulls quickly sell out of their longs for a small profit soon after entering. Aggressive bears see the same thing as the bulls and begin to sell\nexactly where the bulls are selling. With the bulls and the bears both expecting lower prices, there is no one left to buy and the market reverses\ndown, at least for a scalp. If the move down is strong, the bulls will not be willing to buy and the bears will not be eager to take profits until there are\nsigns that the correction is ending. The reversal can lead to a pullback, a larger correction (like a trading range), or a trend reversal.\nAs was discussed earlier in Chapter 3 about double bottoms and tops, final flags are caused by the same basic behavior. For example, if there\nis a potential final flag in a bull trend, there is a push up just before the flag forms. The upside breakout of the flag is a test of that bull high. If more\nsellers than buyers come in as the market tests up, the market will reverse down from this second push up. Although the underlying force is the\nsame, a final flag looks sufficiently different and has several distinctive properties that warrant its being classified as a separate pattern. The same\nis true of a final flag in a bear trend, which is just a pair of moves down and then a reversal up. The bear breakout of the final flag is the second\nmove down and a test of the strength of the bear trend that paused to create the final flag.\nMany bulls and bears will sell soon after the bull breakout of a bull flag, and if enough do, the market will begin to reverse. If a bear reversal setup\ndevelops, traders will become more confident that a bigger correction will follow; more bulls will sell out of their longs, and more bears will begin to\nshort. If the reversal down triggers by moving one tick below the bear reversal bar, the market will get drawn back into that final flag. It may stop\nthere, but the market usually forms at least a two-legged sideways to down correction and often a trend reversal. The trend reversal is more likely if\nthere was a strong bear leg (a sign of selling pressure) in the flag, or earlier, that broke well below the bull trend line. If the original trend lasted for\n50 to 100 bars, then the reversal will more likely evolve into a large flag rather than a trend in the opposite direction. Remember, trends have\ntremendous inertia and tend to resist all reversal attempts. However, each reversal tends to be larger than the one before, and eventually one will\nsucceed in reversing the trend into an opposite trend.\nProtracted climaxes often end after breakouts from brief final flags. For example, if there is a strong four-bar bull spike and if the bodies are large\nand the fourth one is unusually large, it will often lead to brief selling because traders will see the spike as a potential buy climax. Both the bulls and\nthe bears wait for big bars like this. The bulls will use the strength as an opportunity to take partial profits at a very high price, and aggressive bears\nwill sell to initiate short scalps. The result is often a pullback. However, since the bull spike was so strong, there will usually be strong buying at and\nbelow the low of the prior bar. The bulls are buying to reestablish their full long positions, and the bears are buying back their short scalps. The\nresult is that the pullback only lasts from one to a few bars and becomes a high 1 or 2 buy setup. Bulls will buy above the high of the prior bar, and\nmany will also buy if the market breaks above the top of the original bull spike.\nSince the flag followed a strong bull spike that might have gone too far, too fast, many traders will treat the bull flag breakout as only a scalp. They\nwill quickly take their scalper’s profit. Their profit taking, along with shorting by aggressive bears, can quickly turn the market back down after a one-\nor two-bar breakout of the bull flag. This brief breakout is often made of one or more strong bull trend bars, and therefore is another potential buy\nclimax. If enough traders see this as consecutive buy climaxes (the original bull spike was the first), many will only look to buy again after a pullback\nforms that has at least two legs and lasts about 10 bars. Many will short, expecting the larger pullback. If the reversal down came at a significant\nresistance level, many traders will see the move up as simply a buy vacuum test of the resistance level and will be open to the possibility of a trend\nreversal. They will watch the strength of the move down. If it is slow and weak, traders will expect it to become a pullback and will look for the bull\ntrend to resume before long. If it has many bear bodies, they will not be eager to buy, and the market then has to probe lower to find buyers.\nSometimes the market will enter a bear trend, and this can happen even if the original bull spike was very strong and the final flag was only a single\nbar. Many reversals happen after a second push, which essentially forms a double top. The two tops are often at different prices and form either a\nhigher high or a lower high, but together behave like a double top and should always be considered to be different manifestations of the same price\naction.\nWhen the market is in a strong spike and it then has a bar with a tail or opposite body, traders often expect one small final push and then a\npullback. For example, if there is a strong bear spike with four consecutive large bear trend bars mostly closing near their lows, many traders will\nshort around the close of each bar. If the next bar has a big tail on the bottom or a bull body, the bear trend is intact, but traders believe that a\npullback is imminent. Many will short the close of this bar, but will hold only for a scalp, expecting the trade to be the final scalp in the spike.\nBecause they see this as the final scalp, they will then not look to sell again until there is at least a small pullback. With no one willing to continue to\nsell at the bottom of the spike, the market will move up in search of a price that is high enough for the bears to once again short. Aggressive bulls\nknow this and will buy at the bottom of the spike exactly where they think that the bears will be buying back their final short scalp. With both the bulls\nand the bears buying, the market moves up. The move up is usually at least enough for the bulls to scalp out of their longs, but it might last for five to\n10 bars. Since it is the first pullback in a strong bear spike, there will be sellers above. Both the bulls and the bears will sell as the market moves\nabove the high of the prior bar, and for any other small reason, because both are confident that the probability that the pullback will be brief is high.\nThe selling by both the bulls and the bears results in at least one more push down, and the move down might even become a channel that reaches a\nmeasured move, based on the height of the spike. At the other extreme of possibilities, it also might be only a final flag breakout that leads to a\nreversal up. So how is that five-bar bear spike related to final flags? That tail or bull bar at the bottom of the spike told traders that there would be\none more push down before a pullback and that it would go far enough down for a scalp, but that the market would likely reverse up quickly. This\nmeans that they saw the tail or the bull body as a micro final flag, and it was certainly a final flag on a smaller time frame chart. Traders don’t have to\nlook at smaller time frame charts to verify this, because they know that it has to be the case, or else that tail or bull body would not have formed.\nA final bull flag has three ways to break out. First, the breakout can be strong enough to go above the old high of the bull trend and then the\nmarket reverses down in a higher high reversal. Alternatively, the breakout can be weaker, and the market can reverse down below the prior high in\nthe form of a lower high reversal. Finally, there might not be much of a breakout at all, or even no upside breakout. For example, the bull flag might\nform a high 2 or a high 3 buy signal, but the entry bar reverses down after going only a tick or two above the signal bar, or it could simply break to\nthe downside without ever going above the high of the prior bar. If there is a downside breakout of the bull flag, the breakout is usually a spike that is\nthen followed by a bear channel that extends for some type of measured move. If there is no clear breakout and the bull flag just keeps growing into\na larger bear channel, at some point traders will give up on the bull flag premise and see the channel as a bear trend. When this happens, there will\nusually have been at least a one-bar bear spike at the start. When that bear trend bar formed, experienced traders would have wondered if it was\nstrong enough to lead to a bear channel, and many would have been shorting above the highs of the previous bars, just in case a bear trend\ndeveloped. The bull flag, even though it never broke out to the upside, was the final flag in the bull trend.\nWith any bull flag, pullback traders buy and look to exit on a test of the trend’s extreme (the most recent high). They prefer to take profits above\nthe old high, but watch carefully to see if the market stalls below it. If so, they quickly take profits and will buy again only if there is another pullback.\n", "text_clean": "Since the bull trend is still in effect, traders are willing to buy the breakout, but are looking for only a scalp, not a swing. The bears who were shorting during the flag will buy back their shorts. Their buying contributes to the move up, but they are eager to short again once the market reaches some resistance level, which might be a fixed number of ticks where they think the bulls will scalp out of longs or might be some measured move target.\nThe bulls quickly sell out of their longs for a small profit soon after entering. Aggressive bears see the same thing as the bulls and begin to sell exactly where the bulls are selling. With the bulls and the bears both expecting lower prices, there is no one left to buy and the market reverses down, at least for a scalp. If the move down is strong, the bulls will not be willing to buy and the bears will not be eager to take profits until there are signs that the correction is ending. The reversal can lead to a pullback, a larger correction (like a trading range), or a trend reversal.\nAs was discussed earlier in Chapter 3 about double bottoms and tops, final flags are caused by the same basic behavior. For example, if there is a potential final flag in a bull trend, there is a push up just before the flag forms. The upside breakout of the flag is a test of that bull high. If more sellers than buyers come in as the market tests up, the market will reverse down from this second push up. Although the underlying force is the same, a final flag looks sufficiently different and has several distinctive properties that warrant its being classified as a separate pattern. The same is true of a final flag in a bear trend, which is just a pair of moves down and then a reversal up. The bear breakout of the final flag is the second move down and a test of the strength of the bear trend that paused to create the final flag.\nMany bulls and bears will sell soon after the bull breakout of a bull flag, and if enough do, the market will begin to reverse. If a bear reversal setup develops, traders will become more confident that a bigger correction will follow; more bulls will sell out of their longs, and more bears will begin to short. If the reversal down triggers by moving one tick below the bear reversal bar, the market will get drawn back into that final flag. It may stop there, but the market usually forms at least a two-legged sideways to down correction and often a trend reversal. The trend reversal is more likely if there was a strong bear leg (a sign of selling pressure) in the flag, or earlier, that broke well below the bull trend line. If the original trend lasted for 50 to 100 bars, then the reversal will more likely evolve into a large flag rather than a trend in the opposite direction. Remember, trends have tremendous inertia and tend to resist all reversal attempts. However, each reversal tends to be larger than the one before, and eventually one will succeed in reversing the trend into an opposite trend.\nProtracted climaxes often end after breakouts from brief final flags. For example, if there is a strong four-bar bull spike and if the bodies are large and the fourth one is unusually large, it will often lead to brief selling because traders will see the spike as a potential buy climax. Both the bulls and the bears wait for big bars like this. The bulls will use the strength as an opportunity to take partial profits at a very high price, and aggressive bears will sell to initiate short scalps. The result is often a pullback. However, since the bull spike was so strong, there will usually be strong buying at and below the low of the prior bar. The bulls are buying to reestablish their full long positions, and the bears are buying back their short scalps. The result is that the pullback only lasts from one to a few bars and becomes a high 1 or 2 buy setup. Bulls will buy above the high of the prior bar, and many will also buy if the market breaks above the top of the original bull spike.\nSince the flag followed a strong bull spike that might have gone too far, too fast, many traders will treat the bull flag breakout as only a scalp. They will quickly take their scalper’s profit. Their profit taking, along with shorting by aggressive bears, can quickly turn the market back down after a oneor two-bar breakout of the bull flag. This brief breakout is often made of one or more strong bull trend bars, and therefore is another potential buy climax. If enough traders see this as consecutive buy climaxes (the original bull spike was the first), many will only look to buy again after a pullback forms that has at least two legs and lasts about 10 bars. Many will short, expecting the larger pullback. If the reversal down came at a significant resistance level, many traders will see the move up as simply a buy vacuum test of the resistance level and will be open to the possibility of a trend reversal. They will watch the strength of the move down. If it is slow and weak, traders will expect it to become a pullback and will look for the bull trend to resume before long. If it has many bear bodies, they will not be eager to buy, and the market then has to probe lower to find buyers.\nSometimes the market will enter a bear trend, and this can happen even if the original bull spike was very strong and the final flag was only a single bar. Many reversals happen after a second push, which essentially forms a double top. The two tops are often at different prices and form either a higher high or a lower high, but together behave like a double top and should always be considered to be different manifestations of the same price action.\nWhen the market is in a strong spike and it then has a bar with a tail or opposite body, traders often expect one small final push and then a pullback. For example, if there is a strong bear spike with four consecutive large bear trend bars mostly closing near their lows, many traders will short around the close of each bar. If the next bar has a big tail on the bottom or a bull body, the bear trend is intact, but traders believe that a pullback is imminent. Many will short the close of this bar, but will hold only for a scalp, expecting the trade to be the final scalp in the spike.\nBecause they see this as the final scalp, they will then not look to sell again until there is at least a small pullback. With no one willing to continue to sell at the bottom of the spike, the market will move up in search of a price that is high enough for the bears to once again short. Aggressive bulls know this and will buy at the bottom of the spike exactly where they think that the bears will be buying back their final short scalp. With both the bulls and the bears buying, the market moves up. The move up is usually at least enough for the bulls to scalp out of their longs, but it might last for five to 10 bars. Since it is the first pullback in a strong bear spike, there will be sellers above. Both the bulls and the bears will sell as the market moves above the high of the prior bar, and for any other small reason, because both are confident that the probability that the pullback will be brief is high.\nThe selling by both the bulls and the bears results in at least one more push down, and the move down might even become a channel that reaches a measured move, based on the height of the spike. At the other extreme of possibilities, it also might be only a final flag breakout that leads to a reversal up. So how is that five-bar bear spike related to final flags? That tail or bull bar at the bottom of the spike told traders that there would be one more push down before a pullback and that it would go far enough down for a scalp, but that the market would likely reverse up quickly. This means that they saw the tail or the bull body as a micro final flag, and it was certainly a final flag on a smaller time frame chart. Traders don’t have to look at smaller time frame charts to verify this, because they know that it has to be the case, or else that tail or bull body would not have formed.\nA final bull flag has three ways to break out. First, the breakout can be strong enough to go above the old high of the bull trend and then the market reverses down in a higher high reversal. Alternatively, the breakout can be weaker, and the market can reverse down below the prior high in the form of a lower high reversal. Finally, there might not be much of a breakout at all, or even no upside breakout. For example, the bull flag might form a high 2 or a high 3 buy signal, but the entry bar reverses down after going only a tick or two above the signal bar, or it could simply break to the downside without ever going above the high of the prior bar. If there is a downside breakout of the bull flag, the breakout is usually a spike that is then followed by a bear channel that extends for some type of measured move. If there is no clear breakout and the bull flag just keeps growing into a larger bear channel, at some point traders will give up on the bull flag premise and see the channel as a bear trend. When this happens, there will usually have been at least a one-bar bear spike at the start. When that bear trend bar formed, experienced traders would have wondered if it was strong enough to lead to a bear channel, and many would have been shorting above the highs of the previous bars, just in case a bear trend developed. The bull flag, even though it never broke out to the upside, was the final flag in the bull trend.\nWith any bull flag, pullback traders buy and look to exit on a test of the trend’s extreme (the most recent high). They prefer to take profits above the old high, but watch carefully to see if the market stalls below it. If so, they quickly take profits and will buy again only if there is another pullback.", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["Since the bull trend is still in effect, traders are willing to buy the breakout, but are looking for only a scalp, not a swing.

Because scalpers usually take profits at and just above the prior high, most new highs in bull trends find profit takers instead of new buyers.\nThis results in most new highs being followed by pullbacks instead of protracted breakouts and new legs up. However, since most reversal\nattempts fail, most new highs do not result in reversals into bear trends. The reversal often looks strong, but is usually followed by just another bull\nflag. Bulls will buy the pullback and bears will take profits on their short scalps, and the market will test the high again. Eventually, one will be the final\nbull flag and it will be followed by a bigger correction or a reversal, and if there are signs that this will happen, experienced traders will go short.\nSimilarly, the final flag in a bear trend can also break out to the downside and reverse up from a lower low or a higher low, or it can simply break\nout to the upside without ever breaking out to the downside. There can be a failed low 2 or low 3 short and then a reversal up in the form of a large\nbull trend bar. This bull spike becomes the beginning of a new bull swing, and the bear flag will then be seen as the final flag in the bear trend, even\nthough it never had a downside breakout. The bull breakout is the sign that the traders believe that the always-in trade has flipped from short to\nlong.\nIf there are reasons to believe that a bear swing might be ending and it then begins to form a bear flag, traders might think that the low 1 or low 2\nshort entries from that bear flag will fail. If they are expecting no significant bear breakout from this bear flag and instead think that the market will\ntrap bears and then break out to the upside, they can fade the low 1 and low 2 setups. For example, if there is a wedge bottom on a trading range\nday that is beginning to reverse up, traders will expect the low of the wedge to hold. Since they believe that the trend might now be up, they want to\nbuy pullbacks. A pullback can be as small as a single bar. Since there will probably be two legs up, the first leg down should not go far. That low 1\nshort should fail and become a small higher low pullback in the new bull leg, and these bulls will expect at least a two-legged rally that will last 10 or\nmore bars. The only time that a low 1 short is reliable is in the spike phase of a strong bear trend, and never after a reversal pattern. That low 1\nshort entry will likely fail to fall below the low of the wedge and will instead form a small higher low in the two-legged correction up. Because of that,\ntraders will place a limit order to buy at the low or one to three ticks below the low of that short signal bar, expecting a small higher low to form\ninstead of a profitable low 1 short. In the Emini, they usually can risk as few as four ticks.\nAs the reversal up continues, they might think that a low 2 short setup could form. However, since they believe that the trend has reversed into a\nbull trend, they expect that low 2 to fail as well and be followed by higher prices. They are still in the buy pullbacks mode, and that can include a\nsmall pullback like a low 2. Here again, they will place limit orders to buy at or below the low of the low 2 signal bar and risk about four ticks in the\nEmini. They are expecting this bear flag to fail to break out for more than a few ticks, and instead they look for the market to continue to work up into\na bull channel. This is a type of final bear flag because it is the final flag of the bear trend. The bears thought of it as a bear flag, but were able to\nbreak it below the bear signal bar by only a tick or two, and then the flag continued to grow up and to the right until traders realized that it was now a\nbull channel. At some point, when enough traders realize what is happening, the bears cover, and there will usually be an upside breakout and then\na measured move up.\nOnce the bears believe either that the market has reached the top of a trading range or that the bull trend is in the process of reversing down,\nthey will look for high 1 and high 2 signal bars and place limit orders to short at or just above the highs of those bars. They are looking to sell rallies,\neven very small ones like a high 1 or a high 2. Bulls will look to buy low 1 and low 2 entries at the bottom of a trading range and at the bottom of a\nbear trend when they feel that the market is in the process of reversing into a bull swing.\nIf the high 2 is likely to fail, why would it ever trigger in the first place? It triggers because the bears are looking to short above bars, and less so\njust below the highs of bars. They place limit orders to short at and above the high of the prior bar. With a relative lack of bears willing to short just\nbelow the high of the bar, the bulls are unopposed and are able to push the market above the high of the prior bar, hoping that lots of bulls will enter\non buy stops. The high of the bar acts as a magnet, and the push above the bar is a micro buy vacuum. The bulls find that there is an overwhelming\nnumber of bears waiting to short there, and there are lots of bulls, who bought lower, taking profits there. The result is that the high 2 triggers, but the\nmarket immediately turns down. Those bulls who bought over the last several ticks quickly see the lack of a rally above the high of the prior bar.\nBecause the market is not doing what they expected, they exit and will not look to buy again for at least a few bars.

A failed final flag is a setup for a\nresumption of the original trend and therefore is a breakout pullback. After the market broke out of the potential final flag, it tried to reverse, but\ninstead just pulled back a little and then the trend resumed instead of reversed. For example, if the market was in a bull trend and had a potential\nfinal bull flag that broke to the upside and then began to reverse down, but the short entry bar quickly became a strong bull reversal bar, this is a\nsetup for a breakout pullback long. That bull reversal bar was a pullback from the breakout of the potential final flag, and if the bull trend goes far\nenough, it will be beyond the magnetic pull of the final flag and traders will look for other patterns. If the rally goes for only a bar or two and reverses\ndown again, it sets up a second entry short from the original potential final flag. If the reversal succeeds, it is a final flag reversal. If it fails and the\nmarket again turns up, the market is likely in a bull channel, and channels can last for many bars.\nFIGURE 7.1 Final Flag Reversal\n", "text_clean": "Their selling, and their unwillingness to buy for at least a couple more bars while they wait for a pullback, results in a lower high instead of a higher high.

Traders who shorted during those bars either had to cover their shorts or were holding losing positions, which they would soon likely cover with a loss. Also, they would not have been looking to short again for at least several bars, and most would have waited for at least a two-legged rally before considering shorting again. This made the market one-sided, which usually leads to a rally that has at least 10 bars and two legs.\nFIGURE 7.2 Tight Trading Range as a Final Flag A tight trading range after a rally often becomes the final bull flag. In Figure 7.2, the bar 4 breakout above the open was on strength, and led to the formation of a tight trading range. Here, the strong breakout of the flag ended at bar 7, which was a two-legged move up (bar 5 was the first leg), and a wedge top (the first bar of the day was the first push up and bar 4 was the second). Two-legged moves out of flags often set up a major reversal that typically has at least two legs. The move down to bar 10 was in two legs, but it had only a single countertrend bar (bar 9), which meant that it was likely going to be just the first leg of two larger legs. When the two-legged move is in a tight channel, the entire channel usually becomes the first leg. In any case, if short traders were unsure, they could have moved their stops to breakeven after the move down to bar 10 at the moving average.\nBar 9 went above the high of the small bull doji bar to trigger a high 1 buy, but experienced traders expected it to fail after a buy climax and a final flag top.

The breakout above bar 3 was weak and the market pulled back to a small\nhigher low. This was a breakout pullback setup, and it turned the pattern into a wedge bull flag where bars 1 and 3 were the first two pushes down,\nas well as into a triangle (as soon as there was a third push down, the trading range was a triangle). The triangle was horizontal, and it formed after\na protracted rally. It could have enough two-sided trading to generate sufficient magnetic pull to draw any breakout back into the trading range.\nSome traders saw bar 4 as a breakout pullback from the bar 3 bull trend bar and the high 2 entry on the next bar. This bull flag was a potential final\nflag, and bar 5 was the reversal setup. It was the third push up and a breakout of a one-bar pullback, which was a one-bar final flag. However, the\nmomentum up was still so strong that a sideways correction was more likely than a reversal. The market entered a tight trading range from which it\nthen could have broken out to the upside again or reversed down. If it broke to the upside, the tight trading range could have become the final flag.\nFIGURE 7.4 Final Flag, Then a Lower High\nSometimes a final flag breakout reverses at a lower high instead a higher high. In Figure 7.4, the rally up to bar 2 was strong and parabolic and\ntherefore was likely to be followed by at least a two-legged pullback (pullbacks in a bull trend can be sideways or down) that would last at least 10\nbars. It formed a horizontal trading range above the moving average from which it broke out at bar 3. However, the breakout failed and the market\nreversed down in a two-bar reversal. The bar 3 breakout was a lower high instead of a higher high, but it was still the final flag in the bull trend.\nTraders would have shorted below the two-bar reversal. Bar 3 was also a double top bear flag with the small lower high that followed bar 2. Bar 2\nfailed to go above the high of the open, and bar 3 was a second failed attempt to break out to a new high of the day. When the market tries to do\nsomething twice and fails both times, it usually trends in the opposite direction.\nThere was a huge two-bar sell spike on the open and then a bull bar. Any trend bar or series of trend bars forms a breakout, a spike, a gap, and\na climax. This initial sell climax was followed by a second one at bar 1. Consecutive sell climaxes often lead to protracted corrections and\nsometimes reversals, as occurred here. The final flag in the sell-off down to bar 1 was that one-bar pause that formed just before bar 1. This bar\nbecame a one-bar final flag in the sell-off; even though it was a bull reversal bar and its low was below the low of the huge two-bar bear spike\nbefore it, it was a pause in the bear trend, and therefore a bear flag. Consecutive sell climaxes in a freely falling market like this often have a one- or\ntwo-bar final flag that is followed by a large correction or even a reversal. Traders who knew that consecutive sell climaxes usually lead to big\npullbacks were willing to buy the reversal up at the low of the day after they saw that one-bar pause. There was no one left who would sell at the low.\nThe remaining bears would have sold only a pullback and only after at least a 10-bar rally. Bar 1 interrupted the selling and turned it into two\nseparate sell climaxes instead of a single climax. Had it not been there, the selling would have probably continued after bar 1, at least for a bar or\ntwo. Many bears would have bought back their shorts on the close of bar 1, expecting a rally to a level where they would consider shorting again.\nAggressive bulls would have gone long at the close of bar 1, risking about as many ticks as bar 1 was tall, looking for a test of the bar 1 high and\nthen possibly a measured move up, based on the height of bar 1. Bar 1 had 93,000 contracts, which was about 10 times the average volume of\nquiet bars over the past couple of days, and was therefore supportive of a spike and climax type of reversal up. Spike and climax variations of\nspike and channel trends are discussed in book 1. There is a spike down, a pause, and then another sell climax (bar 1), which acts like a one-bar\nchannel in a spike and channel pattern.\nThe horizontal trading range after bar 1 was also a final flag, although it never broke out to the downside. After a sell climax, the market often\nforms a bear flag that can be horizontal or in a bull channel, and sometimes it will have a low 1 or a low 2 short setup as it did here, but there is no\nfollow-through and therefore no bear breakout. Instead, the bear flag broke out to the upside, which is a common way for trends to reverse. The doji\nsignal bars were weak signal bars for shorts after consecutive sell climaxes, and aggressive traders would have bought at or below their lows.\nSince it was the last bear flag, it was a type of final flag. It was also a reversal up from a one-bar final flag, which was the bull reversal bar before the\nlarge bar 1 sell climax. The bull trend bar breakout above the bear flag at 8:05 a.m. PST completed the reversal.\nFIGURE 7.5 Final Flags Sometimes Reverse without First Breaking Out\n", "text_clean": "upside again.\nThe bar 3 two-bar reversal set up a high 2 long and a double bottom with bar 1, and these are reasons enough to buy in a strong bull trend.\nConservative traders saw bar 3 as part of a small channel down from bar 2, and they would have bought above the small double top bear flag formed by the bars just before and after the bar 3 two-bar bull reversal.

In Figure 7.4, the rally up to bar 2 was strong and parabolic and therefore was likely to be followed by at least a two-legged pullback (pullbacks in a bull trend can be sideways or down) that would last at least 10 bars. It formed a horizontal trading range above the moving average from which it broke out at bar 3. However, the breakout failed and the market reversed down in a two-bar reversal. The bar 3 breakout was a lower high instead of a higher high, but it was still the final flag in the bull trend.\nTraders would have shorted below the two-bar reversal. Bar 3 was also a double top bear flag with the small lower high that followed bar 2. Bar 2 failed to go above the high of the open, and bar 3 was a second failed attempt to break out to a new high of the day.

This bar became a one-bar final flag in the sell-off; even though it was a bull reversal bar and its low was below the low of the huge two-bar bear spike before it, it was a pause in the bear trend, and therefore a bear flag. Consecutive sell climaxes in a freely falling market like this often have a one- or two-bar final flag that is followed by a large correction or even a reversal. Traders who knew that consecutive sell climaxes usually lead to big pullbacks were willing to buy the reversal up at the low of the day after they saw that one-bar pause. There was no one left who would sell at the low.\nThe remaining bears would have sold only a pullback and only after at least a 10-bar rally. Bar 1 interrupted the selling and turned it into two separate sell climaxes instead of a single climax.

Bar 1 had 93,000 contracts, which was about 10 times the average volume of quiet bars over the past couple of days, and was therefore supportive of a spike and climax type of reversal up. Spike and climax variations of spike and channel trends are discussed in book 1. There is a spike down, a pause, and then another sell climax (bar 1), which acts like a one-bar channel in a spike and channel pattern.\nThe horizontal trading range after bar 1 was also a final flag, although it never broke out to the downside. After a sell climax, the market often forms a bear flag that can be horizontal or in a bull channel, and sometimes it will have a low 1 or a low 2 short setup as it did here, but there is no follow-through and therefore no bear breakout. Instead, the bear flag broke out to the upside, which is a common way for trends to reverse. The doji signal bars were weak signal bars for shorts after consecutive sell climaxes, and aggressive traders would have bought at or below their lows.\nSince it was the last bear flag, it was a type of final flag. It was also a reversal up from a one-bar final flag, which was the bull reversal bar before the large bar 1 sell climax. The bull trend bar breakout above the bear flag at 8:05 a.m. PST completed the reversal.\nFIGURE 7.5 Final Flags Sometimes Reverse without First Breaking Out", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["upside again.", "The bar 3 two-bar reversal set up a high 2 long and a double bottom with bar 1, and these are reasons enough to buy in a strong bull trend.", "Conservative traders saw bar 3 as part of a small channel down from bar 2, and they would have bought above the small double top bear flag", "formed by the bars just before and after the bar 3 two-bar bull reversal.

The next bar\nwas a bull bar and therefore a two-bar reversal buy signal, but instead of breaking to the upside for a second leg up, the market broke to the\ndownside with a strong bear trend bar. That bar made the bulls give up on their premise, and they then would not look to buy again for at least\nseveral more bars.

The double bottom does not have to be exact, and the second bottom is often\nslightly lower than the first, making the pattern sometimes also a head and shoulders bottom. If the second bottom does not at least reach the first,\nthere is a risk that the bottom is forming only a two-legged sideways to up correction, thereby making it better to look for a scalp long rather than a\nswing. A double bottom (or top) pullback pattern can be thought of as a three-push bottom (or a triple bottom or triangle) where the third push down\ndid not have strong-enough sellers to create a new low. The pattern always forms at a support level, as does every move up in a bear trend. If the\nmove up from the first of the three bottoms is strong enough, traders will wonder if the trend is evolving into a trading range or even a reversal into a\nbull trend. In a trading range, every move down is a bull flag and every move up is a bear flag. If the market is in the early stages of a bull trend, then\nevery move down is also a bull flag. Whether the market is entering a trading range or a new bull trend, the sell-off from the first rally is a bull flag,\neven though it falls to around the level of the first bottom. The rally off the double bottom is a breakout of the bull flag. The pullback (which is the third\nmove down) from the move up off the double bottom is also a bull flag, whether it ends above the double bottom and forms a double bottom\npullback (or a triangle), it ends at the level of the double bottom and forms a triple bottom, or it falls below the double bottom and reverses up and\nforms a failed breakout below a double bottom (basically, a type of final flag reversal). It is also a pullback from that second bull flag, so the rally off\nthe third push down is a breakout pullback from the breakout above the second bull flag. It does not matter where the third push down ends, and it\nalso does not matter if the overall pattern looks like a triple bottom, a triangle, a head and shoulders bottom, a final flag, or a double bottom\npullback, because the significance is the same. The third reversal up creates a three-push down reversal pattern, and traders need to be looking for\nopportunities to get long. When the market forms a double bottom pullback and the shape is good and the bull reversal bars for the three bottoms\nare strong, especially if the final one is strong, the pattern is one of the most reliable buy setups.\nThe move up from the second bottom is usually a breakout, even though it may last for only a couple of bars. The pullback is therefore a breakout\npullback, which is one of the most reliable setups. It can also be thought of as two failed attempts to exceed the prior extreme (often a low 2), and\ntwo failed attempts usually lead to a reversal. Some technicians say that triple bottoms and tops always fail and always become continuation\npatterns, but they require that the three extremes be identical to the tick. With that strict definition, the pattern is so rare that it is not worth\nmentioning. Also, it is simply arrogant to tell the market that you will not allow it to do something, and arrogance always costs you money because it\nis the market and not you that gets to say what can and will happen. Traders will make much more money by using loose definitions. When\nsomething resembles a reliable pattern, it will likely trade like the reliable pattern.\nThis is a reversal pattern and not a continuation pattern, like the double bottom bull flag. Both are long entry setups, but one is the beginning of\nthe trend (a reversal pattern) and the other takes place in an established trend (a continuation pattern), or at least after there has been one strong\nleg.\nLikewise, if there is a double top in a bull trend and there is then a pullback that reaches close to the high, this double top pullback is a good short\nsetup. Again, it does not matter what shape the three-push top takes because the significance is the same. If the signal bar is strong and there is\ngood selling pressure, it is a sell setup, whether it looks like a triple top, a triangle, a head and shoulders top, a final flag, or a double top pullback.\nSometimes there will be both a double top and a double bottom in the same trading range. The result is usually a triangle, which means that the\nmarket is in breakout mode. The market tends to move back to the middle of the range and then test either the top or the bottom, and that third push\nestablishes the triangle. If the range is big enough, traders can scalp shorts as the market reverses down and longs as it reverses up. If the setup is\ngood, the probability of success is about 60 percent for a reward that is at least as large as the risk. If the trading range is too tight, traders can\nchoose to either swing a long or short, or wait for the breakout. If the breakout is strong, trade in its direction, because the probability of a reward\nthat is at least as large as the risk is often 70 percent or more. If it fails, trade in the opposite direction.\nFIGURE 8.1 Double Bottom Pullback in the Monthly SPY\nAs shown in Figure 8.1, the monthly SPY had a double bottom pullback buy at the bar 7 outside bar as it went one tick above the high of the prior\nbar. Outside up bars can be reliable entry bars if the bar before was a decent signal bar, as was the case here. Other traders would have bought\nabove the high of the outside up bar, at the close of the bull trend bar that followed bar 7, above the high of that bull trend bar, and at the close of the\nnext bull trend bar, which confirmed the new trend for many traders. Buying above the high of a strong bull trend bar at the start of a move up is a\nreliable trade, as can be seen by the strong bull trend bar that followed.\n", "text_clean": "CHAPTER 8\nDouble Top and Bottom Pullbacks If a market forms a double bottom after a sell-off, and before the bull trend takes off, and it then has a higher low pullback that tests just above the double bottom low, this is a double bottom pullback long setup.

For a scalper, the goal is a scalper’s\nprofit, but if traders were expecting more and the market failed to meet their expectations, even if it provided a scalper’s profit, it is still a failure.\nEvery failed bull setup is a sign of weakness by the bulls and strength by the bears and every failed sell setup is a sign of weakness by the bears\nand strength by the bulls. Since the most common good setups have about a 60 percent success rate, they have about a 40 percent failure rate.\nWhen a setup fails, it often creates an excellent setup for a trade in the opposite direction. The traders who were just forced out will be hesitant to\nreenter in the same direction, making the market one-sided. In addition, as they exit with their losses, they drive the market even further in the\nopposite direction.\nThis chapter discusses some of the more common occurrences of patterns that fail and reverse enough for a scalp. When the pattern is large\nenough and the context is right, they sometimes can even lead to a major trend reversal. It is critical to understand that every pattern fails some of\nthe time, and traders should accept that as a normal occurrence. Look at a failure as a potential opportunity, because, as mentioned, it will often set\nup a profitable trade in the opposite direction. At other times the failure will result in a second signal in the direction of the original setup.\nHere are some of the common failures that often lead to trades in the opposite direction:\nFailed high 1, high 2, low 1, or low 2.\nFailed breakout of anything, like a swing high or low, a trend line, or a trend channel line.\nFailure to break through a magnet, like a measured move target, a prior swing high or low, a trend line, or a trend channel line.\nFailed final flag (the reversal attempt fails and sets up a breakout pullback).\nFailed wedge.\nFailed signal bar or entry bar.\nFailed one-tick breakout.\nFailed reversal, like a failed double bottom or top or a failed head and shoulders pattern.\nFailure to reach a profit target, like a five-, nine-, or 17-tick failure in the Eminis or an 11, 51, 99, or 101 cent failure in a stock.\nSome failures are a sign of a strong trend and set up a with-trend trade:\nFailure to fall below the low of the prior bar in a strong bull trend or to rally above the high of the prior bar in a strong bear trend. This\nindicates urgency and a strong trend.\nFailure of a pullback to reach the moving average. This indicates urgency and a strong trend.\nFailure to reach a magnet, like a measured move target, a prior swing high or low, a trend line, or a trend channel line. This often leads\nto a pullback and then another attempt to reach the magnet.\nIf a trade makes a scalper’s profit (and therefore the trader exited some or all of the position) and then comes back and takes out the original\nsignal or entry bar stops, there is much less fuel left in the market to drive the market in this new, opposite direction because there are far fewer\ntraders who are trapped in the trade (they already exited with profits). Also, many of the scalpers would exit the balance of their positions at\nbreakeven after taking partial profits, so their stops would be tighter than the original ones beyond the entry or signal bars.\nAlthough a minor reversal might just be a reversal in a trading range that is good for only a scalp, it can sometimes turn into or be a part of a\nmajor reversal of a trend. The single most reliable failure is a flag in a trend. As a flag is forming, countertrend traders are hoping for a trend\nreversal, which is a low-probability bet because markets have inertia and trends resist reversal attempts. For example, if there is a strong bull trend\nand then a reversal setup, some traders will go short. However, if the trade instead goes sideways to down to the moving average and sets up a\nhigh 2 there with a bull signal bar, that bear reversal attempt will likely fail. This is a great buy signal because you are entering in the direction of a\nlarger trend and it is reasonable to expect at least a test of the prior extreme of the trend. Any reversal pattern, including major reversal patterns,\ncan fail and result in the resumption of a trend.\nWhen traders enter a trade, many place a protective stop at one tick beyond the signal bar. After the entry bar closes, if it is strong, many move it\nto one tick beyond the entry bar. How do you know this? By simply looking at charts. Look at any chart and find possible signal and entry bars and\nsee what happens when a bar reverses beyond them. So much of the time, the reversal will be in the form of a strong trend bar, and most of the\ntime the move will be enough for at least a scalper’s profit. This is because once traders get flushed out of a new position with a loss, they become\nmore cautious and want more price action before reentering in the same direction. This leaves the market in the hands of just one side, so the\nmove is usually fast and big enough for a scalp.\nWhy is a one-tick failed breakout so common, especially in the Eminis? With stocks, failures often come on 1 to 10 cent breakouts, depending\non the price of the stock and the personality of the stock. Every stock has distinct characteristics in its trading, presumably because many of the\nsame people trade it every day, so a small group of traders trading sufficient volume can move the market enough to create recurring patterns. If the\nmarket is sideways to down in a weak bull trend, many traders will believe that if the current bar extends one tick above the prior bar, traders will\nbuy there on a stop. Most smart traders will expect this. However, if enough other traders with enough volume feel that the correction has not\nextended deep enough or long enough (for example, if they believe that a two-legged move is likely), those traders might actually go short at the\nhigh or at one tick above the prior bar. If their volume overwhelms the new longs and not enough new longs come to the rescue, the market will likely\ntrade down for a tick or two.\nAt this point, the new longs are feeling nervous. If their entry was at such a great price, why didn’t more buyers come in? Also, now that the market\nis even a tick or two cheaper, this should look like even better value to traders looking to get long. This should quickly drive the price up, but the\nlonger the market stays down even just a couple of ticks, the more new bulls will become concerned that they may be wrong. Some will start selling\nout at the market, adding to the offers, and others will place sell exit orders at one or two ticks lower, maybe basing these orders on a 1 or 3 minute\nchart, with the order one tick below the most recent bar. Once these are hit, these new buyers will also become sellers, pushing the price further\ndown. Also, the original shorts will sense that the new longs are trapped, and many will increase their short positions.

For a scalper, the goal is a scalper’s profit, but if traders were expecting more and the market failed to meet their expectations, even if it provided a scalper’s profit, it is still a failure.\nEvery failed bull setup is a sign of weakness by the bulls and strength by the bears and every failed sell setup is a sign of weakness by the bears and strength by the bulls. Since the most common good setups have about a 60 percent success rate, they have about a 40 percent failure rate.\nWhen a setup fails, it often creates an excellent setup for a trade in the opposite direction.

In the absence of buyers, the price will\ncontinue to fall in search of enough bids to satisfy the sellers. At some point, sellers will begin to cover and take profits, slowing the price fall, and\nbuyers will again begin to buy. Once the buying pressure overtakes the selling pressure, the price will then go up again.\nA one-tick failed breakout on the 5 minute chart when it occurs in a trading range is often also a one-tick failed breakout on a higher time frame,\nlike a 15 or 60 minute chart. If that is the case, why doesn’t the 60 minute chart have a lot of one-tick failed breakouts? That is because many of the\none-tick failed breakouts pull back for many bars on the 5 minute chart and then break out again. The result is that even though there was a one-tick\nfailed breakout of the 60 minute chart as the 60 minute bar was forming, by the time the bar closed, the breakout extended to more than one tick.\nA one-tick failure is a common source of losses for new traders. They will see what they believe is a good setup—for example, a buy—and they\nconfidently place a buy stop order at one tick above the high of the prior bar. Maybe there is a two-bar reversal just above the moving average, but\nit overlaps the prior two bars completely and the long entry is at the top of the small trading range. Novice traders will see the strong bull trend bar\nand buy, but experienced traders know that this type of two-bar reversal is usually a bull trap, and they are likely shorting where the novice traders\nare buying. As expected, the market ticks up and hits the entry buy stops of the novices, making them long. However, the very next tick is one tick\nlower, then two, then three, and within 30 seconds they lose two points as they watch their protective stops get hit. They wonder how anyone could\nbe selling exactly where they were buying. It was such a great setup!\nThese traps are common. Another example is a novice buying in a bear trend before there was a sign of bullish strength, like a prior surge above\na bear trend line, or traders buying above a huge doji with a tiny body at the top of barbwire or a bear flag that they misread as a reversal,\novercome by their eagerness to get in early in what they perceive as an overdone bear trend.\nAnother common situation is when there is a huge trend bar with a tiny tail or no tail. If it is a bull trend bar, lots of traders will put their protective\nstops at one tick below the bar. It is common for the market to work its way down over the next five to 10 bars, hit the stops and trap traders out, and\nthen reverse back up in the direction of the trend bar.\nWhat that novice trader doesn’t realize is that lots of big traders view these as great short setups and they are happy to short, knowing that only\nweak hands would be buying, and as they are flushed out, they will help drive the market down. A one-tick failure is a reliable sign that the market is\ngoing the other way, so look for setups that allow you to enter. All of the preceding is true for down markets as well, and all of the one-tick failures\ncan sometimes be two ticks, and even five to 10 ticks in a $200 stock.\nBreakout tests often test the entry price to the exact tick, trapping out weak hands who will then have to chase the market and reenter at a much\nworse price. A breakout test may miss the breakeven stop by one tick and at other times it will go beyond it for a couple of ticks, but in either case,\nif the market reverses back into the direction of the trend, this failed attempt to reverse the market beyond the original entry price is a reliable with-\ntrend setup. For example, if there is a strong buy setup above a bull reversal bar in the Emini and the market trends up for 10 bars but then later\nsells off, look to see what happens when the sell-off gets near the high of that original bull signal bar. If there is a bar that turns up at two ticks above\nthe high of the signal bar, then it missed the breakeven stops by a tick. The market failed to flush the bulls out. Traders will then buy above this\nbreakout test bar because they will see the failure to hit the protective stops as a sign that the bulls were aggressively buying around the original\nentry price, protecting their stops and making a statement that they are strong.\nMost days have a lot of trading range price action and offer many entries on failed swing high and low breakouts. When the price goes above a\nprior swing high and the momentum is not too strong, place an order to short the higher high at one tick below the low of the prior bar on a stop. If\nthe order is not filled by the time the bar closes, move the order up to one tick below the low of the bar that just closed. Continue to do this until the\ncurrent leg gets so high and has so much momentum that you need more price action before shorting. Wait for another pullback that breaks at least\na minor trend line and then look to short a new swing high. You can also fade new swing highs and lows on trend days after a minor trend line break\nand when there is a strong reversal bar.\nSimilarly, the first failed breakout below a prior swing low is a lower low buy setup. Place an order to buy at one tick above the high of the prior\nbar on a stop. If it is not filled, keep lowering the order to one tick above the high of the prior bar, but if the market drops too far or too fast, start the\nprocess over; wait for a small rally that breaks a minor trend line and then consider buying a failed breakout to a new low.\nIn the Emini, a popular trade is a scalp for four ticks when the average daily range is about 10 points. In a trend, there may be a series of\nsuccessful scalps, but when one hits the limit order and does not get filled, this five-tick failure is a sign of a loss of momentum. These are also\ncommon on 1 and 3 minute charts. Since a six-tick breakout is needed to make a four-tick scalp (one tick for the stop entry, four ticks of profit, and\nusually one more tick to be sure the profit target limit order is filled), a move that goes only five ticks and then reverses often indicates that the trend\ntraders have lost control and a pullback or reversal is imminent. Since many traders also place limit orders to capture two-, three-, or four-point\nprofit targets, if the market reverses at one tick shy of these targets, it is also a sign of weakness. For example, if the market makes a significant\nintraday low and then rallies 17 ticks above the signal bar high, most traders trying to exit on limit orders with four points of profit will not get filled\nunless the market goes 18 ticks above the signal bar.\nIf instead the market hits 17 ticks and then the next bar trades below that bar, the remaining longs who did not exit one tick early will now think\nabout exiting, and this often results in at least a downward scalp. Traders will assume that the bulls were taking their profit at one tick early, which\nmeans that the longs were not confident that the market would give them the full four points. This lack of confidence can lead to profit taking by the\nlongs and aggressive shorting by the bears. Bulls could continue to rely on their trailing stops and hope that the market soon fills their four-point limit\norders, but most traders would not be willing to risk having a 15-tick open profit turn into a two- or three-tick profit in an attempt to win that extra tick.\nThis is the same as scalping for a one-tick profit while risking 10 or more ticks and is a losing strategy. Once the market hits 17 ticks and pulls back\na few ticks, if traders’ profit-taking limit orders are not filled, they would most likely lower their profit targets by a couple of ticks and raise their\ntrailing stops to one tick below the low of the prior bar. If neither order is filled and the bar had a weak or bear close, they might just exit at the\nmarket. Incidentally, if the market goes 16 ticks above the signal bar high, it has about an 80 percent chance of reaching 17 or 18 ticks. This means\nthat it is usually unwise to exit after 16 ticks unless the market trades below the low of the prior bar, especially if that bar is a short signal.\nMost traders handle potential nine-tick failures in a similar way. If traders bought the Emini and were trying to exit with a two-point profit, their limit\norders would be nine ticks above the high of the signal bar. The market usually has to go one more tick to fill the order, which is 10 ticks above the\nsignal bar high. If the market hits the order but does not fill it and begins to trade down, they have to decide whether to rely on their initial stop or a\ntrailing stop, like one tick below the low of the most recent bar with a decent-sized bull body. If their limit order is exactly at a resistance level, like a\nprior swing high, and it does not quickly break above, they might also quickly lower their limit order by a few ticks. Once it hits nine ticks, they should\nnever allow the trade to turn into a loss, because they would then be risking eight or more ticks to make one tick, and this has a terrible trader’s\nequation.\nThere are comparable failures in other markets that have many scalpers, like the SPY and the QQQ. For both, a common profit target is 10 ticks,\nwhich usually requires a 12-tick move beyond the signal bar. If the move reaches only 10 or 11 ticks (or even eight or nine) and then reverses, it\n", "text_clean": "five ticks, the stopped-out buyers will switch from looking to buy to waiting for more price action to unfold.

Once the buying pressure overtakes the selling pressure, the price will then go up again.\nA one-tick failed breakout on the 5 minute chart when it occurs in a trading range is often also a one-tick failed breakout on a higher time frame, like a 15 or 60 minute chart. If that is the case, why doesn’t the 60 minute chart have a lot of one-tick failed breakouts? That is because many of the one-tick failed breakouts pull back for many bars on the 5 minute chart and then break out again. The result is that even though there was a one-tick failed breakout of the 60 minute chart as the 60 minute bar was forming, by the time the bar closed, the breakout extended to more than one tick.\nA one-tick failure is a common source of losses for new traders. They will see what they believe is a good setup—for example, a buy—and they confidently place a buy stop order at one tick above the high of the prior bar. Maybe there is a two-bar reversal just above the moving average, but it overlaps the prior two bars completely and the long entry is at the top of the small trading range. Novice traders will see the strong bull trend bar and buy, but experienced traders know that this type of two-bar reversal is usually a bull trap, and they are likely shorting where the novice traders are buying. As expected, the market ticks up and hits the entry buy stops of the novices, making them long. However, the very next tick is one tick lower, then two, then three, and within 30 seconds they lose two points as they watch their protective stops get hit. They wonder how anyone could be selling exactly where they were buying. It was such a great setup!\nThese traps are common. Another example is a novice buying in a bear trend before there was a sign of bullish strength, like a prior surge above a bear trend line, or traders buying above a huge doji with a tiny body at the top of barbwire or a bear flag that they misread as a reversal, overcome by their eagerness to get in early in what they perceive as an overdone bear trend.\nAnother common situation is when there is a huge trend bar with a tiny tail or no tail. If it is a bull trend bar, lots of traders will put their protective stops at one tick below the bar. It is common for the market to work its way down over the next five to 10 bars, hit the stops and trap traders out, and then reverse back up in the direction of the trend bar.\nWhat that novice trader doesn’t realize is that lots of big traders view these as great short setups and they are happy to short, knowing that only weak hands would be buying, and as they are flushed out, they will help drive the market down. A one-tick failure is a reliable sign that the market is going the other way, so look for setups that allow you to enter. All of the preceding is true for down markets as well, and all of the one-tick failures can sometimes be two ticks, and even five to 10 ticks in a $200 stock.\nBreakout tests often test the entry price to the exact tick, trapping out weak hands who will then have to chase the market and reenter at a much worse price. A breakout test may miss the breakeven stop by one tick and at other times it will go beyond it for a couple of ticks, but in either case, if the market reverses back into the direction of the trend, this failed attempt to reverse the market beyond the original entry price is a reliable withtrend setup. For example, if there is a strong buy setup above a bull reversal bar in the Emini and the market trends up for 10 bars but then later sells off, look to see what happens when the sell-off gets near the high of that original bull signal bar. If there is a bar that turns up at two ticks above the high of the signal bar, then it missed the breakeven stops by a tick. The market failed to flush the bulls out. Traders will then buy above this breakout test bar because they will see the failure to hit the protective stops as a sign that the bulls were aggressively buying around the original entry price, protecting their stops and making a statement that they are strong.\nMost days have a lot of trading range price action and offer many entries on failed swing high and low breakouts. When the price goes above a prior swing high and the momentum is not too strong, place an order to short the higher high at one tick below the low of the prior bar on a stop. If the order is not filled by the time the bar closes, move the order up to one tick below the low of the bar that just closed. Continue to do this until the current leg gets so high and has so much momentum that you need more price action before shorting. Wait for another pullback that breaks at least a minor trend line and then look to short a new swing high. You can also fade new swing highs and lows on trend days after a minor trend line break and when there is a strong reversal bar.\nSimilarly, the first failed breakout below a prior swing low is a lower low buy setup. Place an order to buy at one tick above the high of the prior bar on a stop. If it is not filled, keep lowering the order to one tick above the high of the prior bar, but if the market drops too far or too fast, start the process over; wait for a small rally that breaks a minor trend line and then consider buying a failed breakout to a new low.\nIn the Emini, a popular trade is a scalp for four ticks when the average daily range is about 10 points. In a trend, there may be a series of successful scalps, but when one hits the limit order and does not get filled, this five-tick failure is a sign of a loss of momentum. These are also common on 1 and 3 minute charts. Since a six-tick breakout is needed to make a four-tick scalp (one tick for the stop entry, four ticks of profit, and usually one more tick to be sure the profit target limit order is filled), a move that goes only five ticks and then reverses often indicates that the trend traders have lost control and a pullback or reversal is imminent. Since many traders also place limit orders to capture two-, three-, or four-point profit targets, if the market reverses at one tick shy of these targets, it is also a sign of weakness. For example, if the market makes a significant intraday low and then rallies 17 ticks above the signal bar high, most traders trying to exit on limit orders with four points of profit will not get filled unless the market goes 18 ticks above the signal bar.\nIf instead the market hits 17 ticks and then the next bar trades below that bar, the remaining longs who did not exit one tick early will now think about exiting, and this often results in at least a downward scalp. Traders will assume that the bulls were taking their profit at one tick early, which means that the longs were not confident that the market would give them the full four points. This lack of confidence can lead to profit taking by the longs and aggressive shorting by the bears. Bulls could continue to rely on their trailing stops and hope that the market soon fills their four-point limit orders, but most traders would not be willing to risk having a 15-tick open profit turn into a two- or three-tick profit in an attempt to win that extra tick.\nThis is the same as scalping for a one-tick profit while risking 10 or more ticks and is a losing strategy. Once the market hits 17 ticks and pulls back a few ticks, if traders’ profit-taking limit orders are not filled, they would most likely lower their profit targets by a couple of ticks and raise their trailing stops to one tick below the low of the prior bar. If neither order is filled and the bar had a weak or bear close, they might just exit at the market. Incidentally, if the market goes 16 ticks above the signal bar high, it has about an 80 percent chance of reaching 17 or 18 ticks. This means that it is usually unwise to exit after 16 ticks unless the market trades below the low of the prior bar, especially if that bar is a short signal.\nMost traders handle potential nine-tick failures in a similar way. If traders bought the Emini and were trying to exit with a two-point profit, their limit orders would be nine ticks above the high of the signal bar. The market usually has to go one more tick to fill the order, which is 10 ticks above the signal bar high. If the market hits the order but does not fill it and begins to trade down, they have to decide whether to rely on their initial stop or a trailing stop, like one tick below the low of the most recent bar with a decent-sized bull body. If their limit order is exactly at a resistance level, like a prior swing high, and it does not quickly break above, they might also quickly lower their limit order by a few ticks. Once it hits nine ticks, they should never allow the trade to turn into a loss, because they would then be risking eight or more ticks to make one tick, and this has a terrible trader’s equation.\nThere are comparable failures in other markets that have many scalpers, like the SPY and the QQQ.

There was two-sided volatile\ntrading and until a bull trend clearly developed, traders should have assumed that both bulls and bears were active. Since this had not proven itself\nyet to be a bull trend day, it should have been traded as a trading range day.\nBar 3 was a higher high since it was a swing high that was above an earlier swing high. The momentum up to bar 3 was too strong to consider a\nshort without a second entry or a strong reversal bar, but if a trader shorted, the move down was 26 cents, so it could have been minimally\nprofitable.\nBar 5 was a higher high and a reasonable short, especially since it had two small legs (there was a bear trend bar in the middle that represented\nthe end of the first leg up from bar 4).

You should only rarely enter on a\nbreakout of an outside bar because the risk is too great (to the opposite side of the bar, which is large). Since this was a two-bar reversal, the\nsafest entry was below the lower of the two bars, which was the large bull trend bar, because very often the market goes below the bear bar, but not\nbelow both bars, and that happened here.\nIf you shorted at the bar 8 breakout of the inside bar, you would have been nervous by the bar’s close (a doji bar, indicating no conviction).\nHowever, most traders would not have taken that short, because three or more sideways bars, at least one of which is a doji, usually creates too\nmuch uncertainty (barbwire). The two small bars before the outside bar were small enough to act like dojis, so it was best to wait for more price\naction. However, if you did not short on bar 8, you would have to believe that many did and the doji close of their entry bar made these traders feel\nuncomfortable with their positions. They would have been quick to exit, thereby becoming trapped. They would likely have bought back their shorts\nat one tick above the bar 8 entry bar and then be reluctant to sell again until they saw better price action. With the shorts out of the market and with\nthem buying back their positions, going long exactly where they were exiting (bar 9, one tick above the short entry bar) should have been good for a\nscalp and likely two legs up. A trader could have bought either at one tick above bar 9 or above the bar after bar 9, relying on bar 9 being a bull\ntrend bar and therefore a good long signal bar.\nFIGURE 9.13 Five-Tick Failure\nScalping short for four ticks was a successful strategy for almost two hours in Figure 9.13. However, the short from the bar 4 inside bar dropped\nonly five ticks and reversed up. This meant that many shorts did not get filled on their profit-target limit order and that the shorts were quick to exit at\nbreakeven and certainly above bar 5. The market was testing yesterday’s low, and it was the second probe below the trend channel line (based on\nthe trend line from bar 1 to bar 3).

Any type of price action can happen at any time of the day, but there is a tendency for\nthe first hour or two to be the most likely time of the day to find a trade where you can make two to three times your risk. This is the most important\ntime of the day, and for most traders it is the easiest time to make money (and the easiest to lose money, if a trader is not careful). In general, most\ntraders should work very hard to take trades in the first hour or two because those trades have the best trader’s equation combination of reward,\nrisk, and probability. Because of its importance, the chapters in Part III discuss it in detail. There are often reports at 7:00 a.m. PST, and they\ncommonly lead to the trend of the day. Computers have a clear edge in speed of analysis and order placement, and they are your competitors.\nWhen your competition has a big advantage, don’t compete. Wait for their edge to disappear, and trade when speed is no longer important. Once\nthe always-in direction has been established, then look to take the trend trade. Even though you might miss the first bar or two, if the trend is strong,\nthere will be plenty of points left in the trade.\nOn the daily chart, there is often a small tail below strong bull trend bars and above strong bear trend bars. These are often caused by opening\nreversals. For example, if bulls think that the day is likely to be a strong bull trend day and it trades down for the first few bars of the day, the majority\nof them will believe that this will likely be the low of the day and a great opportunity to buy at a tremendous value that will soon disappear. If they are\nright, the market will rally, and they will have bought around the low of the day. On the daily chart, there will be a small tail on the bottom of the bull\ntrend bar that resulted from the three-bar sell-off on the open. Because they were ready for that possibility, these smart bulls made a huge reward,\nrisking little, on a trade that probably had at least a 50 percent chance of success (remember, because of the overall character of the market, they\nbelieved that the day was likely to rally).\nThe middle of the day, beginning around 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. PST and ending around 11:00 to 11:30 and sometimes as late as 12:30, is more\nprone to two-sided trading, like trading ranges or channels. This is the time of the day when tight trading ranges are the most common. This is a\nterrible environment for entering on stops. In very two-sided markets, when the market goes down a little, buyers come in and take control, so\nentering on stops as the market is falling is the exact opposite of what the institutions are doing in these tight trading ranges. The buyers are the\nbears scalping out of their profitable shorts and the bulls buying for scalps up. At the top, the opposite happens and the selling predominates. The\nbulls sell out of their profitable long scalps, and the bears sell to initiate short scalps. There are swing traders as well, but in general, when the\nmarket is in a trading range, whether or not it is tight, most of the volume is scalping and the institutions are buying low and selling high. The best\nway to make money as a trader is to do what the institutions do, so if you are going to trade in a trading range, look to scalp, and buy low, sell high.\nExperienced traders will sell on limit orders above weak high 1 and high 2 buy signal bars at the top, and buy on limit orders below weak low 1 and\nlow 2 signal bars at the bottom. Because limit orders trades are more difficult to evaluate accurately, beginners should avoid them. Be very careful\nabout stop entries and only sell on a stop if you are at the top of the range as the market is turning down, and only buy on a stop near the bottom as\nthe market is turning up. The market always races to the top and bottom, suckering hopeful beginners into buying on stops at the top and selling on\nstops at the bottom. They just look at the strength of the spikes up and down and ignore the trading range of the past 20 bars and end up doing the\nopposite of the institutions. Because so many of the trade setups are for scalps and most traders cannot make a living by scalping, they should be\nvery selective during this time. Since the high or low of the day forms during the first third of the day in maybe 90 percent of days, the middle third of\nthe day is usually when traders are deciding if the initial trend should resume or reverse. The bulls and the bears are active, each fighting over\ncontrol and each trying to generate a trend into the close. The market often reverses around 8:30 a.m. PST and then trends for the rest of the\nmiddle third of the day. Traders need to be aware that the trend that began at the open might not last all day, and the exact opposite can develop\nafter the first couple of hours.\nBeginning traders tend to lose money in the middle third of the day. They often lose more than they have made in the first third of the day, and if\nthat is the case, they should consider not trading in the middle third unless signals are especially strong. Many traders make most of their money in\nthe first couple of hours of the day and then trade much less or not at all during the middle of the day. If a person owns two stores and one makes a\nlot of money, but the other consistently loses money no matter what the owner does, and often more than what he makes from his good store,\nshould he continue to operate both stores? The answer is obvious. You can look at the first and middle thirds of the day as two stores. There is\nnothing wrong with closing that losing store. Your goal is to make money, not to trade all day long. If the price action is good all day long and you are\nnot tired, then it is financially wise to trade all day. However, that is usually not the case. The middle third tends to have much more two-sided\ntrading, channels, tight trading ranges, many reversals, trend bars without follow-through, and lots of dojis. Unless traders are very selective with\ntheir stop entries or capable of making money by fading moves with limit orders, they should just wait for the price action to become more\npredictable. It is always better to not take any trades than to take trades where your losses are greater than your wins. Beginners frequently win just\noften enough to make them continue what they are doing, hoping that all they need is experience. However, no matter how much experience they\naccumulate, a tight trading range will always be difficult to trade. It is almost always better to wait until the always-in direction is clear, so that the\nodds of follow-through are high enough to allow for a profitable trade.\nThe three periods of the day often create a trend resumption pattern. For example, if there is a sell-off for a couple of hours, and then a rally into\naround 11:30 a.m. PST, the market might sell off again after that, resuming the bear trend of the first third of the day. Sometimes the pattern is\nclearly up-down-up or down-up-down, but more often it is less obvious, even though the tendency is still there. Because of this, many traders will\nview any move in the middle third of the day that reverses a move of the first third as simply a potential pullback from the initial trend. They will then\nlook for the original trend to resume around 11:30 a.m., and if there is a sign that this is what’s happening, they will take the trade. Even on days\nwhen the pattern is not clear, traders know that the market often makes some move around 11:30 a.m. that will often carry into the close of the day\nas the institutions begin their final trading of the day. The move can be a reversal, but it can also be a breakout. For example, if there was a strong\nsell-off for the first two hours and then a weak rally into 11:30 a.m., and it appears to be topping out and reversing, the market might instead break\nout to the upside and lead to a trend reversal day and a rally into the close. Traders aren’t married to any particular direction going into 11:30 a.m.,\nbut are always ready for a move in either direction as the market enters the final third of the day and the institutions begin their final trades.\nThe final period of the day runs until the close; it often resumes the trend from earlier in the day, as in a trend resumption day, but it sometimes\n", "text_clean": "CHAPTER 11\nKey Times of the Day The trading day can be divided into three periods, and although the same price action principles apply throughout the day, there are some generalizations about each period that are useful for traders. Any type of price action can happen at any time of the day, but there is a tendency for the first hour or two to be the most likely time of the day to find a trade where you can make two to three times your risk. This is the most important time of the day, and for most traders it is the easiest time to make money (and the easiest to lose money, if a trader is not careful). In general, most traders should work very hard to take trades in the first hour or two because those trades have the best trader’s equation combination of reward, risk, and probability. Because of its importance, the chapters in Part III discuss it in detail. There are often reports at 7:00 a.m. PST, and they commonly lead to the trend of the day. Computers have a clear edge in speed of analysis and order placement, and they are your competitors.\nWhen your competition has a big advantage, don’t compete. Wait for their edge to disappear, and trade when speed is no longer important. Once the always-in direction has been established, then look to take the trend trade. Even though you might miss the first bar or two, if the trend is strong, there will be plenty of points left in the trade.\nOn the daily chart, there is often a small tail below strong bull trend bars and above strong bear trend bars. These are often caused by opening reversals. For example, if bulls think that the day is likely to be a strong bull trend day and it trades down for the first few bars of the day, the majority of them will believe that this will likely be the low of the day and a great opportunity to buy at a tremendous value that will soon disappear. If they are right, the market will rally, and they will have bought around the low of the day.

On some days many mutual funds will have similar orders to fill going into the\nclose. Traders who want to enter on pullbacks get trapped out because a pullback never comes. If you see this, enter with the trend on the close of\nthe current bar and put your protective stop beyond the other end of the bar. If the trend continues into the close, you can make a quick windfall\nprofit. It is worth noting that traders often get tired, and since their edge is small, they should refrain from trading if they cannot trade at their best.\nTraders can get tired, bored, or distracted at any time during the day and should not trade until they are back to normal.

This is another one of the advantages that they have over individual traders.\nWhen there is a bull trend on the daily chart, there will almost always be more bull trend bars than bear trend bars. The opposite is true when\nthere is a bear trend. For example, if the market is in a strong bear trend and there is a moderate rally going into the last hour, many traders will\nexpect the day to close near its low and for the bar on the daily chart to be a strong bear trend bar with a close near its low. Because of this,\nexperienced traders will be quick to short any rally that begins to reverse down toward the end of the day, expecting a close near the low of the day.\nOther traders will wait for the sell-off to become clear and then short. The result is often a strong bear trend into the close of a bear trend day when\nthere is a bear trend on the daily chart.

Also, the probability is only 50 percent. The result is a bad\ntrader’s equation, and most traders should wait for seconds to minutes until the market becomes orderly before placing a trade.\nFIGURE 11.1 Risk Managers Contribute to Trends into the Close\nAs shown in Figure 11.1, the rally into the close was due in part to the risk manager shoulder tap. As the market began to turn up and reached bar\n22, all of the traders who shorted after bar 10 were in jeopardy of having losing positions by the close, and all those who shorted after bar 16 were\nalready holding losers. Risk managers at trading firms monitor what positions traders are holding into the close. If a lot of traders are holding shorts\nthat are suddenly becoming losers, they might be emotionally attached to their trades and hope for a late sell-off. Their bonuses depend on their\nperformance, and they might hate to admit that they are suddenly wrong about today’s bear trend. The risk manager’s job is to be coldly objective,\nand he will tell the traders to buy back their shorts. If this takes place at enough firms, it can contribute to a relentless uptrend into the close. Traders\nat home were hoping for a pullback, but it never came. Once they realized what was happening, they could have bought above the brief pullbacks at\nbars 21 and 23 or bought the close of any bar, and then placed protective stops below the low of their entry bar.

Mutual and hedge fund purchases going\ninto the close can also contribute. All of these traders are doing the opposite when the market sells off into the close.\nThe market was in a tight bull channel on the daily chart (not shown).

{"book": "REVERSAL", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\reversal3.pdf", "page_index": 117, "text_raw": "CHAPTER 13\nTime Frames and Chart Types\nFor a scalper, it is easiest to use a 5 minute candle chart for the Emini. However, for intraday swing trading of the Emini or stocks, a simple 5\nminute bar chart works well. This is because on a laptop or a single monitor, you can fit six bar charts on your screen, each with a different stock,\nand each chart will contain a full day's worth of bars. If you use candles, which are wider than bars, your charts will show only about a half day of\nprice action. An important reason for mentioning this is to remind traders that this approach works well with simple bar charts, especially when you\nare trying to swing trade only the best entries. The advantage of candle charts on the Emini for scalpers is that it is easy to quickly see who owns\nthe bars, especially the setup bar. Also, a lot of high and low 2 variants are not easy to see on bar charts.\nPrice action trading techniques work in all markets and all time frames, so traders have to make the obvious basic decision of which markets\nand time frames they should trade. The objective of most traders is to maximize profitability over the long run, and implicit in that is that each trader\nneeds to find an approach that suits his or her personality.\nIf a 5 minute Emini chart offers a dozen good entries on average every day, and the 3 minute chart offers 20, and the 1 minute offers 30, and the\nrisk (size of the protective stop) is eight ticks on the 5 minute, six ticks on the 3 minute, and four ticks on the 1 minute, why not trade the shorter time\nframes? More trades, smaller risk, more money—right? Right, if you can read the charts correctly fast enough in real time to be able to place your\nentry, stop, and profit target orders at the exact prices correctly, and do this constantly for seven hours a day, year in and year out. For many\ntraders, the smaller the time frame, the more good trades they miss, and the lower their winning percentage becomes. They simply cannot scalp\nwith this method fast enough on the 1 and 3 minute charts to be as profitable as they are on the 5 minute chart, so that should be their focus and\nthey should continually work on increasing their position size. The best trades often come as a surprise, and the setups can be hard to trust. Most\ntraders simply cannot process the information fast enough. Invariably, they will cherry-pick and tend not to pick the very best setups, which are the\nmost important ones to their bottom lines. The best trades often set up and trigger so fast that they are easy to miss, and then you are left with all\nthe trades that are less good, including all of the losers.\nThe average size of a move on a higher time frame chart is greater than that on a smaller time frame chart. However, almost every higher time\nframe swing starts with a reversal on the 1 and 3 minute charts. It is just hard to know which ones will work, and it can be draining trying to take 30\nor more trades a day, hoping for a big move. The very best trades on 1 and 3 minute charts lead to strong entries on 5 and 15 minute charts, and\nfor most traders it is much more profitable to focus on the best 5 minute trades and work on increasing their position size. Once they can trade\nsuccessfully, they can make an incredible amount of money and have a very high winning percentage, which results in much less stress and a better\nability to maintain their performance over time.\nAlso, as your position size increases, at some point the volume will affect the market on too many trades on a 1 minute chart. As an extreme\nexample, if you had a profit-target limit order to sell 5,000 Emini contracts at two ticks above the market, anyone with a price ladder would see the\naberration and you would have a difficult time getting filled on 10 to 15 trades a day. Also, entering that size on a stop would result in a tick or two of\nslippage, which would ruin the risk/reward ratio of scalping. A trader can trade even 5,000 contracts per trade using price action, but not with the\nentry and exit scalping techniques needed for most trades. May you someday have the problem of having to rethink your approach because your\nvolume is adversely affecting your fills!\nThe 1 minute chart can be helpful in two situations. If the 5 minute chart is in a runaway trend and you are flat but want to get in, you can look at a 1\nminute chart for high/low 2 pullbacks to enter with the trend. The second situation where 1 minute charts are helpful for experienced traders is in\nswing trading trending stocks off the 5 minute chart. When stocks are trending, they are very respectful of the moving average and with-trend trades\ncan be made off high/low 1 or 2 setups at the moving average, risking the height of the signal bar. Traders can reduce that risk somewhat by\nentering on the 1 minute chart on the first reversal after a moving average touch or penetration on the 5 minute chart. If you plot a 5 minute 20 bar\nmoving average on the 1 minute chart, you can quickly see the touches and then place the order. You actually need to plot a 90 bar moving average\non the 1 minute chart as a surrogate for the 5 minute 20 bar moving average. Why 90 and not 100 bars? Because the moving average on the 1\nminute chart is recalculated at the close of every 1 minute bar, and not just at the close of every fifth bar, so the weighting of the more recent bars\ntends to make a 100 bar moving average a tiny bit too flat. Also, the first four closes on the 1 minute chart are not part of the 5 minute moving\naverage. To correct for this, use a 90 bar moving average (I use an exponential moving average, but any moving average is fine), which is very\nclose to the 5 minute 20 bar moving average. In actual practice, you will rarely have time to look at a 1 minute stock chart because of your focus on\nthe Emini. However, when a stock is strongly trending, you might occasionally take quick entries off the 1 minute chart.\nImplicit in this discussion is that there can be opposite trends on different time frames. For example, if the market has been going up strongly for\na couple of weeks, but for the past two days it has been in a trending bear channel and for the past 15 minutes it is in a pullback up to the falling 5\nminute moving average, then the 5 minute chart is in a bear trend, the 1 minute chart is in a bull trend, and the two days of downward movement are\nlikely forming a bull flag on the 60 minute chart. It is also possible that the daily chart is bearish and the monthly chart is bullish, both at the same\ntime. It is too confusing to try to reconcile all of this, and it is a waste of time to wait for all time frames to be going in the same direction, because\nthat rarely happens, and even if it does, there is no guarantee of a profitable trade. Just pick one time frame, and trade the price action that is in\nfront of you. If you read correctly and trade well, you will do fine without ever knowing what is going on in all of those other charts.\nMany traders use charts where the bars are based on volume and not time. For example, an Emini chart can be constructed where each bar\ncloses as soon as 5,000 or more ticks have occurred, or as soon as 25,000 contracts were traded. It does not matter what type of chart you use as\nlong as you are comfortable with the speed needed to read the chart and place the order. The patterns on all charts are based on human behavior\nand are therefore the same. Trend lines tend to be more precise on charts based on time than those based on volume, but many traders don't worry\nabout precise trend lines and instead just use approximations.\nI have a group of friends who use tick charts based on Fibonacci numbers, and other friends who use time charts based on odd times, like eight\nor 13 minutes. Everything works some of the time, but it is easier to trade if you pick just one chart. It does not matter if it is a tick chart, a volume\nchart, or a time chart, and it does not matter how many ticks, shares, or minutes are in each bar.

However, for intraday swing trading of the Emini or stocks, a simple 5 minute bar chart works well. This is because on a laptop or a single monitor, you can fit six bar charts on your screen, each with a different stock, and each chart will contain a full day's worth of bars. If you use candles, which are wider than bars, your charts will show only about a half day of price action. An important reason for mentioning this is to remind traders that this approach works well with simple bar charts, especially when you are trying to swing trade only the best entries. The advantage of candle charts on the Emini for scalpers is that it is easy to quickly see who owns the bars, especially the setup bar. Also, a lot of high and low 2 variants are not easy to see on bar charts.\nPrice action trading techniques work in all markets and all time frames, so traders have to make the obvious basic decision of which markets and time frames they should trade. The objective of most traders is to maximize profitability over the long run, and implicit in that is that each trader needs to find an approach that suits his or her personality.\nIf a 5 minute Emini chart offers a dozen good entries on average every day, and the 3 minute chart offers 20, and the 1 minute offers 30, and the risk (size of the protective stop) is eight ticks on the 5 minute, six ticks on the 3 minute, and four ticks on the 1 minute, why not trade the shorter time frames? More trades, smaller risk, more money—right? Right, if you can read the charts correctly fast enough in real time to be able to place your entry, stop, and profit target orders at the exact prices correctly, and do this constantly for seven hours a day, year in and year out. For many traders, the smaller the time frame, the more good trades they miss, and the lower their winning percentage becomes. They simply cannot scalp with this method fast enough on the 1 and 3 minute charts to be as profitable as they are on the 5 minute chart, so that should be their focus and they should continually work on increasing their position size. The best trades often come as a surprise, and the setups can be hard to trust. Most traders simply cannot process the information fast enough. Invariably, they will cherry-pick and tend not to pick the very best setups, which are the most important ones to their bottom lines. The best trades often set up and trigger so fast that they are easy to miss, and then you are left with all the trades that are less good, including all of the losers.\nThe average size of a move on a higher time frame chart is greater than that on a smaller time frame chart. However, almost every higher time frame swing starts with a reversal on the 1 and 3 minute charts. It is just hard to know which ones will work, and it can be draining trying to take 30 or more trades a day, hoping for a big move. The very best trades on 1 and 3 minute charts lead to strong entries on 5 and 15 minute charts, and for most traders it is much more profitable to focus on the best 5 minute trades and work on increasing their position size. Once they can trade successfully, they can make an incredible amount of money and have a very high winning percentage, which results in much less stress and a better ability to maintain their performance over time.\nAlso, as your position size increases, at some point the volume will affect the market on too many trades on a 1 minute chart. As an extreme example, if you had a profit-target limit order to sell 5,000 Emini contracts at two ticks above the market, anyone with a price ladder would see the aberration and you would have a difficult time getting filled on 10 to 15 trades a day. Also, entering that size on a stop would result in a tick or two of slippage, which would ruin the risk/reward ratio of scalping. A trader can trade even 5,000 contracts per trade using price action, but not with the entry and exit scalping techniques needed for most trades. May you someday have the problem of having to rethink your approach because your volume is adversely affecting your fills!\nThe 1 minute chart can be helpful in two situations. If the 5 minute chart is in a runaway trend and you are flat but want to get in, you can look at a 1 minute chart for high/low 2 pullbacks to enter with the trend. The second situation where 1 minute charts are helpful for experienced traders is in swing trading trending stocks off the 5 minute chart. When stocks are trending, they are very respectful of the moving average and with-trend trades can be made off high/low 1 or 2 setups at the moving average, risking the height of the signal bar. Traders can reduce that risk somewhat by entering on the 1 minute chart on the first reversal after a moving average touch or penetration on the 5 minute chart. If you plot a 5 minute 20 bar moving average on the 1 minute chart, you can quickly see the touches and then place the order. You actually need to plot a 90 bar moving average on the 1 minute chart as a surrogate for the 5 minute 20 bar moving average. Why 90 and not 100 bars? Because the moving average on the 1 minute chart is recalculated at the close of every 1 minute bar, and not just at the close of every fifth bar, so the weighting of the more recent bars tends to make a 100 bar moving average a tiny bit too flat. Also, the first four closes on the 1 minute chart are not part of the 5 minute moving average. To correct for this, use a 90 bar moving average (I use an exponential moving average, but any moving average is fine), which is very close to the 5 minute 20 bar moving average. In actual practice, you will rarely have time to look at a 1 minute stock chart because of your focus on the Emini. However, when a stock is strongly trending, you might occasionally take quick entries off the 1 minute chart.\nImplicit in this discussion is that there can be opposite trends on different time frames. For example, if the market has been going up strongly for a couple of weeks, but for the past two days it has been in a trending bear channel and for the past 15 minutes it is in a pullback up to the falling 5 minute moving average, then the 5 minute chart is in a bear trend, the 1 minute chart is in a bull trend, and the two days of downward movement are likely forming a bull flag on the 60 minute chart. It is also possible that the daily chart is bearish and the monthly chart is bullish, both at the same time. It is too confusing to try to reconcile all of this, and it is a waste of time to wait for all time frames to be going in the same direction, because that rarely happens, and even if it does, there is no guarantee of a profitable trade. Just pick one time frame, and trade the price action that is in front of you. If you read correctly and trade well, you will do fine without ever knowing what is going on in all of those other charts.\nMany traders use charts where the bars are based on volume and not time. For example, an Emini chart can be constructed where each bar closes as soon as 5,000 or more ticks have occurred, or as soon as 25,000 contracts were traded. It does not matter what type of chart you use as long as you are comfortable with the speed needed to read the chart and place the order. The patterns on all charts are based on human behavior and are therefore the same. Trend lines tend to be more precise on charts based on time than those based on volume, but many traders don't worry about precise trend lines and instead just use approximations.\nI have a group of friends who use tick charts based on Fibonacci numbers, and other friends who use time charts based on odd times, like eight or 13 minutes. Everything works some of the time, but it is easier to trade if you pick just one chart. It does not matter if it is a tick chart, a volume chart, or a time chart, and it does not matter how many ticks, shares, or minutes are in each bar. There will be great price action signals on all types of charts all day long. What is far more important is a trader's ability to read real time and manage trades correctly. You can experiment with totally random numbers of ticks, shares, or minutes per bar and you will see that the charts look great and have lots of reasonable signals.

{"book": "REVERSAL", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\reversal3.pdf", "page_index": 125, "text_raw": "CHAPTER 15\nAlways In\nThis might be the single most important concept in trading. Traders should constantly assess whether the market is trending, and an “always-in”\napproach can help a trader to make that important determination. If you had to be in the market at all times, either long or short, the always-in\nposition is whatever your current position is. Some variation of this is used by many traders, including institutions. For example, most mutual funds\nare usually always-in long, and most hedge funds remain close to fully invested, but often have always-in long positions in some markets while\nsimultaneously having always-in short positions in others. Individual traders should consider using an always-in approach if they tend to miss too\nmany big moves.\nDetermining the always-in direction is different from asking whether the trend is up or down, because most trend traders don't hold a position\nwhen the market is unclear. The market, at all times, is either always-in long or always-in short, and there is usually a general consensus about the\ndirection of the trend. Traders who take 20 or more trades a day see the always-in position flipping repeatedly throughout the day, but very few\ntraders could reverse this often, day after day. However, traders who are just looking for the best three to 10 swings a day, and are willing to allow\nmultiple pullbacks without changing their opinion about the direction of the current swing, have an always-in mentality. They can either reverse at\neach new signal or take profits once a swing begins to weaken and then look for a trade in either direction. Few traders actually stay in the market\nall day long, reversing at every opposite signal. Most traders need to take breaks during the day and they have a difficult time placing reversal\ntrades. Although they will take many always-in reversal setups, they usually trade each as a swing trade, exiting before looking for a trade in the\nopposite direction. They focus more on making a profit that is at least as large as the risk, rather than on reversing on the next opposite signal, and\nuse always-in signals as their entry setups. In general, if a signal is clear enough to be an always-in reversal, traders should assume that it is then at\nleast 60 percent certain of reaching a profit target that is at least as large as the risk. Even though the minimum criterion for an always-in signal is\nthat the market is more likely to go in the new direction than in the old one, which implies that all that is needed is 51 percent certainty, most such\nsignals are 60 percent certain or higher. For example, in the Emini, if traders need to use a two-point stop to take a trade, they should use a profit\ntarget that is at least two points from their entry, and they will likely have at least a 60 percent chance of success if they read the price action\ncorrectly.\nIf traders look at the chart at this moment and are forced to initiate a position right now, either short or long, and they could decide at least slightly\nin favor of one direction or the other, then they see an always-in position. This is the direction of at least the short-term trend. If they cannot formulate\nan opinion, they should look at the moving average and at the move that led to the current state of uncertainty (remember, uncertainty means that\nthe market is in a trading range). If most of the closes of the recent bars are below the moving average, the always-in position is probably short. If\nthey are mostly above, always in is probably long. If the move leading up to the trading range was a rally, the always-in position is probably long. If it\nwas a sell-off, always in is probably short. If you are hoping for a pullback to buy, the always-in position is probably long. If you are hoping for a rally\nto short, always in is probably short. If you simply cannot decide, then the market is in a trading range and you look to buy low and sell high. Your\ngoal is to get synchronized with what the market is doing. It is like when you were a child and two of your friends were swinging a jump rope and you\nwere about to run in and start jumping the rope. You would watch it intensely to sense the rhythm. Once you were reasonably confident, you began\njumping. With trading, once you are reasonably confident of where the market it heading, that is the time to jump in.\nSome traders use higher time frame charts to determine the always-in direction. For example, if they trade the 5 minute chart, and the 60 minute\nchart is in a bull trend and above the moving average, they will look only for buy setups on the 5 minute chart. Others use indicators on higher time\nframe charts in the same way. For example, if the 60 minute stochastic is rising, they will look only to buy pullbacks on the 5 minute chart. Some\ntraders don't feel comfortable evaluating 10 to 20 reversals a day on the 5 minute chart and instead prefer a higher time frame chart where there\nmight be only three to five decisions a day. This is an effective approach, but since the bars are larger, stops have to be larger as well, and that\nmeans that position sizes should be smaller.\nEven before the market opens, traders have a bias that the final always-in position from yesterday might still be controlling the market. However,\nonce there are two consecutive reasonably strong trend bars in the same direction, they probably create the new always-in direction. It is uncertain\nuntil there is a breakout and then follow-through, but it is a starting point. If the context is right, it can lead to a trade, like entering on the first\npullback. With a lot of experience, a trader could theoretically stay in the market all day, reversing at each reasonable signal.\nThe market is always trying to reverse, and often comes very close, but lacks that last bit of follow-through that traders need to become confident\nthat the reversal was successful. These near flips are great opportunities for the with-trend traders. For example, if there is a bull trend that forms a\nstrong bear breakout bar, many bulls will buy the close of the bar, expecting that there will be no follow-through selling. They correctly believe that\nmost reversal attempts fail and that this will be a brief opportunity to buy at a great price. Other bulls will wait to see what the close of the next bar\nlooks like. If it is not a bear close, they will buy the close, and other bulls will buy above its high, and above the high of the strong bear bar where\nbears might have their protective stops.

Traders should constantly assess whether the market is trending, and an “always-in” approach can help a trader to make that important determination. If you had to be in the market at all times, either long or short, the always-in position is whatever your current position is. Some variation of this is used by many traders, including institutions. For example, most mutual funds are usually always-in long, and most hedge funds remain close to fully invested, but often have always-in long positions in some markets while simultaneously having always-in short positions in others. Individual traders should consider using an always-in approach if they tend to miss too many big moves.\nDetermining the always-in direction is different from asking whether the trend is up or down, because most trend traders don't hold a position when the market is unclear. The market, at all times, is either always-in long or always-in short, and there is usually a general consensus about the direction of the trend. Traders who take 20 or more trades a day see the always-in position flipping repeatedly throughout the day, but very few traders could reverse this often, day after day. However, traders who are just looking for the best three to 10 swings a day, and are willing to allow multiple pullbacks without changing their opinion about the direction of the current swing, have an always-in mentality. They can either reverse at each new signal or take profits once a swing begins to weaken and then look for a trade in either direction. Few traders actually stay in the market all day long, reversing at every opposite signal. Most traders need to take breaks during the day and they have a difficult time placing reversal trades. Although they will take many always-in reversal setups, they usually trade each as a swing trade, exiting before looking for a trade in the opposite direction. They focus more on making a profit that is at least as large as the risk, rather than on reversing on the next opposite signal, and use always-in signals as their entry setups. In general, if a signal is clear enough to be an always-in reversal, traders should assume that it is then at least 60 percent certain of reaching a profit target that is at least as large as the risk. Even though the minimum criterion for an always-in signal is that the market is more likely to go in the new direction than in the old one, which implies that all that is needed is 51 percent certainty, most such signals are 60 percent certain or higher. For example, in the Emini, if traders need to use a two-point stop to take a trade, they should use a profit target that is at least two points from their entry, and they will likely have at least a 60 percent chance of success if they read the price action correctly.\nIf traders look at the chart at this moment and are forced to initiate a position right now, either short or long, and they could decide at least slightly in favor of one direction or the other, then they see an always-in position. This is the direction of at least the short-term trend. If they cannot formulate an opinion, they should look at the moving average and at the move that led to the current state of uncertainty (remember, uncertainty means that the market is in a trading range). If most of the closes of the recent bars are below the moving average, the always-in position is probably short. If they are mostly above, always in is probably long. If the move leading up to the trading range was a rally, the always-in position is probably long. If it was a sell-off, always in is probably short. If you are hoping for a pullback to buy, the always-in position is probably long. If you are hoping for a rally to short, always in is probably short. If you simply cannot decide, then the market is in a trading range and you look to buy low and sell high. Your goal is to get synchronized with what the market is doing. It is like when you were a child and two of your friends were swinging a jump rope and you were about to run in and start jumping the rope. You would watch it intensely to sense the rhythm. Once you were reasonably confident, you began jumping. With trading, once you are reasonably confident of where the market it heading, that is the time to jump in.\nSome traders use higher time frame charts to determine the always-in direction. For example, if they trade the 5 minute chart, and the 60 minute chart is in a bull trend and above the moving average, they will look only for buy setups on the 5 minute chart. Others use indicators on higher time frame charts in the same way. For example, if the 60 minute stochastic is rising, they will look only to buy pullbacks on the 5 minute chart. Some traders don't feel comfortable evaluating 10 to 20 reversals a day on the 5 minute chart and instead prefer a higher time frame chart where there might be only three to five decisions a day. This is an effective approach, but since the bars are larger, stops have to be larger as well, and that means that position sizes should be smaller.\nEven before the market opens, traders have a bias that the final always-in position from yesterday might still be controlling the market. However, once there are two consecutive reasonably strong trend bars in the same direction, they probably create the new always-in direction. It is uncertain until there is a breakout and then follow-through, but it is a starting point. If the context is right, it can lead to a trade, like entering on the first pullback. With a lot of experience, a trader could theoretically stay in the market all day, reversing at each reasonable signal.\nThe market is always trying to reverse, and often comes very close, but lacks that last bit of follow-through that traders need to become confident that the reversal was successful. These near flips are great opportunities for the with-trend traders. For example, if there is a bull trend that forms a strong bear breakout bar, many bulls will buy the close of the bar, expecting that there will be no follow-through selling. They correctly believe that most reversal attempts fail and that this will be a brief opportunity to buy at a great price. Other bulls will wait to see what the close of the next bar looks like. If it is not a bear close, they will buy the close, and other bulls will buy above its high, and above the high of the strong bear bar where bears might have their protective stops. When the bears don't get the immediate follow-through that they need, they will buy back their shorts. With both the bulls and the bears buying, the market goes up for at least several bars. The bears will not be willing to short until another reasonable setup occurs, and that often will occur after a new trend high. When beginning traders see that strong bear spike, they become scared.

When a strong trend transitions into a trading range,\nthe always-in position often remains unchanged. If traders are going to trade in the trading range, they should scalp most or all of their trades.\nHowever, if the always-in position does not change, they should consider taking scalps only in the direction of the trend. For example, if there is a\nstrong bear trend that is starting to correct up, but there is no strong bull spike and the market is staying below the moving average, the always-in\nposition will remain down. Even though the market is in a trading range, traders should look for scalps only in the direction of the trend, which\nmeans that they should look for shorts. If there is a strong buy setup, it will probably flip the always-in position to long, at least for enough bars to buy\nfor a scalp. However, any buy setup that is not strong enough to flip the always-in direction to up is generally not worth trading.\nSince this is a swing approach, traders should not use it when the market is in a tight trading range. In fact, most traders should not trade then,\nand should instead wait for the breakout or failed breakout. Either can lead to an always-in swing trade. If experienced, profitable traders want to\ntrade in a tight trading range, they should either take the always-in trade that was present prior to the formation of the tight trading range and hold\nfor a swing profit, or simply trade scalps with limit order entries, fading the extremes of the range and the breakouts above and below the prior bars.\nOn trading range days, always-in reversals are often unclear until the market gets near the opposite end of the range. For example, it often is not\nclearly long until there is a bull spike that surges to the top of the range, and it is often not clearly short until there is a strong bear spike that races to\nthe bottom of the range. However, buying near the top of the range and shorting near the bottom is the exact opposite of what traders should be\ndoing. Always in is a swing concept that applies to trends, and is dangerous within trading ranges, where it is better to scalp and buy low and sell\nhigh. For example, as the market is moving toward the top of the range, there will be breakouts above swing highs within the range that might make\nsome traders see the market as flipping to always-in long, but usually the swing high is not important enough and the breakout and follow-through\nare not strong enough to convince everyone that the market has flipped. If you are looking at the move up and are wondering if it has truly flipped\ninto an always-in long move, then you are uncertain. Since uncertainty is the hallmark of a trading range, you have your answer. Trends create a\nsense of sustained urgency. You are certain that the market has more to go and you are desperately hoping for a pullback so you can buy lower.\nTraders realize that if the move up is a new bull trend and not just a brief spike up in a trading range, the move will have a series of strong bull bars\nand won't pause after going above each swing high. A consensus forms only if the market breaks strongly above the entire range and has follow-\nthrough, not if there is simply a sharp move within the range toward the top or bottom. Beginners are afraid that there might not be much left to the\nmove, but experienced traders know that a strong successful breakout from a trading range will usually reach a measured move target at a\nminimum and provide plenty of room for a profit.\nOn trading range days, the strongest bear spikes often form near the low of the day because of a sell vacuum. The strong bulls expect a test of\nthe low of the trading range, so they stop buying as the market approaches the low. This creates an imbalance and the market falls quickly in a bear\nspike. Also, momentum programs will sense the acceleration and they will also quickly short until the momentum slows or reverses. If traders looked\nat only the current leg down, they would see a strong bear spike and assume that the always-in trade had just become strongly short. However, if\nthey stepped back and looked at the entire chart, they would be suspicious of a possible sell vacuum. Instead of looking for shorts, they would look\nto buy the failed breakout attempt.\nSo what does a trader need to see to be able to choose an always-in direction? Almost all always-in trades require a spike before traders will\nhave confidence. Traders want to see a breakout that is strong enough for them to expect follow-through. The signs of strength of breakouts were\ndiscussed in the second book. There usually has to have been at least two consecutive strong bull trend bars before most traders will believe that\nthe always-in direction is long, and at least two consecutive strong bear trend bars before they will think that always in is short. During the first hour,\nbefore a clear trend is established, two consecutive bull trend bars will make traders look for buy scalps, and two consecutive bear trend bars will\nmake them look for sell scalps. This is discussed in Chapter 19 on trading the open.\nIf the context is right, even a single trend bar with an average range can be enough to make traders believe that the always-in position has flipped\nto the opposite direction. Usually, however, at least two or more consecutive trend bars are needed before enough traders believe that the direction\nhas reversed for there to be significant follow-through. Just like a countertrend trader might be willing to hold a position through one pullback but not\ntwo (for example, when buying a bottom, the bulls will exit and sometimes reverse to short if a low 2 triggers), always-in traders will generally prefer\nto see a second consecutive strong trend bar before they feel that the always-in position has reversed.\nSince a second trend bar is usually needed for traders to believe that the always-in position has reversed, the close of that trend bar is important.\nFor example, if there is a bear breakout bar, then traders will carefully watch the close of the next bar. The bears will want a bear close and the bulls\nwill want a bull body. The market has inertia, so most attempts to change what it is doing will fail. This means that many traders will buy the close of\nthe bear breakout bar, expecting that the follow-through bar will have a bull close and the bears will give up. If the breakout is not too strong and\nthere is a good reason to believe that the breakout should fail (like a breakout attempt at the bottom of a bull flag), this can be a good trade; but\nbecause the decision is difficult, only experienced traders should consider it. The bulls want to buy pullbacks, so they look for bear spikes to fade.\nThey see a bear spike as a commitment by the bears who are on the wrong side of the market, and will therefore have to buy back their shorts with\nlosses. Also, those bears will not look to sell again for at least a bar or two, so there will be fewer bears coming into the market. This increases the\nchances that the bulls who bought that bear spike will make a profit. Similarly, when the market is always-in short, bears look at bull spikes at the\ntop of small legs as great opportunities to short. They assume that the bulls will be trapped and will soon have to become sellers as they exit their\nlongs with losses.\nIf the follow-through bar is strong, traders can enter on the close of the bar or on a small pullback. For example, if there is a strong bull breakout\nand the next bar is a strong bull trend bar, many traders will buy on the close of that follow-through bar or on a one- or two-tick pullback. If the follow-\nthrough bar is weak, like a doji, it is usually better to look to buy pullbacks rather than the close of the bar. If the follow-through bar goes only a few\nticks beyond the breakout bar, odds favor a failed breakout. If it goes many ticks beyond, the odds favor the bar becoming a strong trend bar once\nit closes. Most traders will see the market as having a clear always-in direction. Sometimes the market goes only a few bars beyond the breakout\nbar and then quietly reverses in a channel against the direction of the breakout without ever clearly confirming that the breakout has failed and that\nthe always-in direction has flipped. In this case, the always-in position is probably unchanged for most traders, but they will have protective stops to\nget them out if the pullback grows too far. The market is likely entering a trading range, so they will convert to a trading range mode of trading, which\nmeans scalping and not allowing their winners to turn into losers. For example, if there is a bull breakout followed by a few weak bars of follow-\nthrough, and then the market begins to form a weak bear channel without ever having a bear spike, the market can remain always-in long. However,\nbulls should have protective stops, just in case the bear channel falls a long way without ever having a clear bear reversal. If bulls bought early on\nand had a large open profit, they could have their stops at breakeven. If they bought late, they should probably exit below the signal bar. In general, if\nthe follow-through is weak, traders should not buy near the high, and should instead wait to buy a pullback. If they did buy near the top, they could\nonly do so because they sensed urgency. If there is no immediate follow-through to prove that the urgency is present, they should exit and look to\nbuy on a pullback.\n", "text_clean": "these institutions will reenter in the direction of the trend, resulting in a resumption of the trend.

If it is a small\nbear bar or a doji bar, this is confirmation that the bears are in control for most traders, but it is a sign that the new bear trend is not strong. It is\nbetter to look to sell rallies and low 1 and low 2 setups than it is to sell the closes of the bars. If the follow-through bar has a strong bull body or is a\nbull reversal bar, this can be a buy signal for a failed breakout. If it has a small bull body, most traders will wait for more evidence before shorting,\nbut believe that the chance of a new trend is much less. The opposite is true when the market is breaking out into a possible always-in bull. The\nminimum requirement for the follow-through bar is usually that it does not have a bear close. If the follow-through bar is not impressive, then look to\nbuy pullbacks instead of buying the close of the bar. If the follow-through bar has a bear close, the breakout might be a bull trap, and this is often a\nsignal bar for a failed breakout short. However, occasionally the market might have flipped into a bull trend, but traders will need more confirmation\nbefore drawing that conclusion.\nOnce traders are confident that the breakout has follow-through, they will then look for a measured move. For example, if there is a strong bull\nspike lasting three bars and breaking above a trading range, many traders will believe that there will probably be a measured move up based on\nthe height of the spike or the height of the trading range, and many will immediately buy at least a small position at the market. Since they are\nconfident, then they are at least 60 percent certain about the directional probability (discussed in book 2) of an equidistant move, and whenever that\nis the case, the math favors taking a trade. As the spike continues, the risk remains constant, and the directional probability of an equidistant move\nwill stay at 60 percent or better, but the reward grows and this makes the trade even better mathematically. If they buy at the top of a strong three-\nbar spike in Goldman Sachs (GS) and the spike is $1.00 tall, there is at least a 60 percent chance that the market will go up for a measured move\nof $1.00 before it falls $1.00 to the bottom of the spike. If the spike grows to $1.50 over the next couple of bars, they are still risking to the bottom of\nthe spike (they would probably have tightened their stop at this point), and now the measured move target is $1.50 above the current bar and $2.00\nabove their entry. They now have at least a 60 percent chance of making $2.00 before losing no more than $1.00, which means that their trade is\nvery strong. If the spike continues to grow, the probability will remain good and the reward will continue to grow. As traders tighten their stops, the\nrisk shrinks and the trade becomes even better mathematically. In general, whenever the market is clearly always in and traders are assessing a\ntrade using the trader's equation, they should assume that the probability is at least 60 percent.\nThe market usually enters always-in mode at some point in the first hour, and many traders like to take an always-in trade at that point. Some\ntake profits once the market moves in their direction for a distance that is one or two times greater than their risk. For example, if they bought an\nalways-in entry in Apple (AAPL) and their initial protective stop was a dollar below their entry price, they would try to exit some or all of their trade\nafter a dollar or two of profit. Others prefer to hold their position until there is a clear reversal and the market has flipped to always in, but in the\nopposite direction. Then they would reverse their position and truly stay always in the market. Since most traders do not have the ability to flip on\nevery minor reversal, they instead look for only the very strongest two to five reversals of the day. Sometimes there will be a pullback that just keeps\ngrowing, but does not clearly create an always-in reversal. For example, if the market had a strong bull spike and the market was clearly always-in\nlong, but then there was a low-momentum pullback that went on for hours, traders need to reassess their premise. They should keep a worst-case\nscenario protective stop in the market just in case the pullback continues to grow to the point that the market falls below their entry price. It will\nsometimes do that without ever having a clear bear spike and an always-in sell signal. If they had an open profit of several Emini points, they would\nprobably not want the market to come back to their entry price, and they might choose to use a breakeven stop. If they get stopped out, they could\nwait and look for an always-in trade in either direction. If the market pulls back within minutes of their entry before they had any meaningful profit,\ntheir protective stop should be below the bull spike, even though it might be far away. If it is far, their position size has to be small enough to keep\ntheir risk within their normal limits.\nOnce you believe that the market has become always in, it is usually best to enter at least a small position at the market or on a tiny pullback. This\nis especially true when the always-in direction is clear and strong. When the momentum is low and there is not that sense of urgency, some traders\nprefer to enter on a larger pullback. However, they risk missing the move since many great always-in trades begin with low momentum, but they just\nkeep going without a pullback until after many bars and many points. In general, whenever the market is always-in long, traders will look at every\nattempt by the bears to turn the market down as a buying opportunity, because they know that most attempts to reverse a trend will fail. They will buy\nat and around the close of any bear trend bar, at and below the low of the prior bar or any prior swing low, and below all support levels, like bull\ntrend lines. When the market is always-in short, traders will see every attempt by the bulls to reverse the market up as a selling opportunity, because\nthey correctly assume that most such attempts will fail. They will short around the high of any bull trend bar, the high of the prior bar, any prior swing\nhigh, and any resistance level, like a bear trend line.\nSince you are swinging during always-in trading, you have to allow pullbacks, which are inevitable. Most pullbacks are not reversal entries, so you\ncannot allow yourself to be constantly worrying about every move that is against your position. In general, if there is a pullback that would have hit a\nbreakeven stop and then the market resumes in your direction for several bars, it should not come back to your entry price again. Therefore, in most\ncases, you could then move your stop to breakeven. If it is hit by that second pullback and you are not certain of the market's direction, just remain\nflat until you feel comfortable with another always-in setup. Remember, uncertainty is a hallmark of a trading range and always in is an approach for\ntrends.\nIf you believe that there is an always-in direction, you should not take countertrend trades. This is because they almost certainly would have to be\nscalps, which means that the risk would probably be about twice the reward and the chance of success would have to be an unrealistic 70 percent\nor greater. If you think that there is going to be a pullback, it is far better mathematically to wait to enter in the direction of the trend at the end of the\npullback than it is to bet that the pullback will be large enough and mathematically certain enough for you to make a profitable countertrend scalp.\nI have a friend who patiently waits for an always-in setup in the first couple of hours every day, and when he finds one, he expects a trend to last\nfor at least a couple of hours and cover at least a third of an average daily range. Once he sees his always-in setup, he enters the market and then\nplaces a bracket order where the stop is beyond the signal bar and his profit-taking limit order is at some measured move target or support or\nresistance area that is at least twice as far away as his stop. Since he is taking an always-in entry, the probability of at least an equidistant move is\n60 percent or better. If he is risking two points in the Emini, then he has at least a 60 percent chance of making two points before his protective stop\nis hit. However, when he is risking two points, his profit target is always four points or more, and with an always-in entry, his probability of success is\nlikely at least 50 percent. Although the probability is never known with certainty, it is likely over 60 percent with many of his entries. However, he, like\nmany traders, does not want to trade in the middle of the day when minor reversals are common. So what does he do while he is waiting for his\ntrade to work? He goes on errands or out for exercise. He comes back a couple of hours later, and at that point, he looks for an always-in trade into\nthe close of the day.\nWhat constitutes a strong always-in market? Since always in can occur only when there is trend or at least a potential trend, look for the signs of\nstrength in trends and reversals. There is a list of them at the beginning of this book (Introduction). The more that are present, the more likely you will\nmake a profit.

They do not want to\nwait for a pullback, because they are more confident that the market will be higher at some point over the next several bars than they are that there\nwill be a pullback. This urgency is a perfect always-in situation, and if you are not long, you should consider buying at least a small position at the\nmarket or on a limit order located a few ticks below the high of the bar. You can see where your stop would have to be, which might be at the low of\nthe entry bar of the reversal. If that means you have to risk eight points and you normally risk only two, then take only a quarter of your normal\nposition size. The most important consideration for you is that you must get long, even if it is a tiny position, because you are confident that the\nmarket is going higher. If you believe that the day is becoming a strong bull trend day, try to hold at least some of your position until the close of the\nday, unless a clear and strong bear reversal develops.\nFor stocks, breakeven stops have less chance of being hit, so it is more profitable to look to swing trade. Typically, look to scalp out a third to a\nhalf after about a 0.5 to 1 percent move or about twice the size of your initial risk, and then swing the balance. If the market appears to be reversing\nagainst your trade but has not yet reversed, like at a test of a high of the day, take off another quarter to a third, but always try to let at least a quarter\nrun until your breakeven stop is hit, until there is a clear and strong opposite signal, or until the close. Trends often go much further than you could\never imagine.\nHold the position through repeated pullbacks until you exit at your target price, until there is a clear reversal setup, or until the protective stop is\nhit. Sometimes a pullback is violent, but not enough to trigger an always-in reversal, so stick with your original plan and don't be upset by a single\nlarge trend bar against your position. If your stop is hit, stay out of the market until there is another clear and strong setup in either direction. If there\nis a clear and strong setup, repeat the process. If your trading size is two contracts and you are long one when a reversal pattern triggers, sell three.\nOne gets you out of your remaining long position and the other two start the process in this new, opposite direction. Scalp the first for one to two\ntimes the size of your risk and swing the second.\nThe key to this approach is to enter or reverse only when there is a clear and strong setup. If not, rely on your breakeven stop, even though you\nmay give back all of the gains on your swing portion. If you watch a small basket of stocks, almost every day at least one will set up with a reliable\nentry that will allow you to put on a swing trade.\nAt any moment during the day you might decide that there is clearly a trend or that there has been a clear reversal. You need one or both for any\nalways-in trade. One side is in control of the swing and there is likely more to go in that direction. Think about where the protective stop would be\nand calculate the number of ticks that you would be required to risk if you were to enter at the market. As a general rule, the trend will likely continue\nabout the same number of ticks and the odds of success are better than 50–50, since you believe that there is a trend. If you are confident that the\nmarket is always in, the probability is likely 60 percent or more. After the trend continues, you are usually able to trail the protective stop and reduce\nyour risk. Also, your original profit goal can increase if the market has trended a long way since your entry, and the new protective stop location\nleads to a new profit projection. This results in a revised evaluation with a profit potential that is greater than your risk with the probability of success\nstill greater than 50–50. The improving math that is inherent in swing trading during trends is the reason that it is one of the best ways to trade,\nespecially for beginners.\nExperienced traders can use the always-in approach to scale into positions in the direction of the trend, but this requires confidence in your\nassessment of the strength of the trend. For example, if traders feel that there is a strong bull trend, then they might use limit orders to scale into\nlongs based on the recent average daily range. If they are trading the Emini and the recent average daily range has been about 12 to 15 points and\nthe largest pullback in the past couple of hours has only been two points, they might buy a small position on a one-point pullback and buy more at\none and two points lower (10 to 20 percent of the average daily range) and then maybe use a stop on the entire position another couple of points\ndown. If the earlier pullbacks were three points, they might instead place a limit order to buy three points down and buy more two or three points\nlower and use a two-point stop on the entire position. If at any time the market flipped to always-in short, they would exit the position and look to get\nshort. Scaling in is discussed in book 2.\nFIGURE 15.1 Always-In Swing Trading\nAlways-in trading can be a profitable swing trading approach during both trend days and trading range days, if the trading range days have large\nenough swings. As shown in Figure 15.1, the first day was a trading range day, and the always-in approach could have netted 52 ticks, or about\n$600 per contract. The second day began as a trend from the open bear and then entered a trading range. An always-in trader could have netted\n79 ticks or about $950 per contract. A trader who traded two lots, scalping one and swinging one, could have had 10 successful scalps each day,\nyielding an additional $450 per contract per day. It sounds and looks easy, but is very difficult to do.\nFIGURE 15.2 Higher Time Frame Charts\n", "text_clean": "the spike at this point is made of three reasonably sized bull trend bars, traders are buying at the market and on tiny pullbacks.

Typically, look to scalp out a third to a half after about a 0.5 to 1 percent move or about twice the size of your initial risk, and then swing the balance. If the market appears to be reversing against your trade but has not yet reversed, like at a test of a high of the day, take off another quarter to a third, but always try to let at least a quarter run until your breakeven stop is hit, until there is a clear and strong opposite signal, or until the close. Trends often go much further than you could ever imagine.\nHold the position through repeated pullbacks until you exit at your target price, until there is a clear reversal setup, or until the protective stop is hit. Sometimes a pullback is violent, but not enough to trigger an always-in reversal, so stick with your original plan and don't be upset by a single large trend bar against your position. If your stop is hit, stay out of the market until there is another clear and strong setup in either direction. If there is a clear and strong setup, repeat the process. If your trading size is two contracts and you are long one when a reversal pattern triggers, sell three.\nOne gets you out of your remaining long position and the other two start the process in this new, opposite direction. Scalp the first for one to two times the size of your risk and swing the second.\nThe key to this approach is to enter or reverse only when there is a clear and strong setup. If not, rely on your breakeven stop, even though you may give back all of the gains on your swing portion. If you watch a small basket of stocks, almost every day at least one will set up with a reliable entry that will allow you to put on a swing trade.\nAt any moment during the day you might decide that there is clearly a trend or that there has been a clear reversal. You need one or both for any always-in trade. One side is in control of the swing and there is likely more to go in that direction. Think about where the protective stop would be and calculate the number of ticks that you would be required to risk if you were to enter at the market. As a general rule, the trend will likely continue about the same number of ticks and the odds of success are better than 50–50, since you believe that there is a trend. If you are confident that the market is always in, the probability is likely 60 percent or more. After the trend continues, you are usually able to trail the protective stop and reduce your risk. Also, your original profit goal can increase if the market has trended a long way since your entry, and the new protective stop location leads to a new profit projection. This results in a revised evaluation with a profit potential that is greater than your risk with the probability of success still greater than 50–50. The improving math that is inherent in swing trading during trends is the reason that it is one of the best ways to trade, especially for beginners.\nExperienced traders can use the always-in approach to scale into positions in the direction of the trend, but this requires confidence in your assessment of the strength of the trend. For example, if traders feel that there is a strong bull trend, then they might use limit orders to scale into longs based on the recent average daily range. If they are trading the Emini and the recent average daily range has been about 12 to 15 points and the largest pullback in the past couple of hours has only been two points, they might buy a small position on a one-point pullback and buy more at one and two points lower (10 to 20 percent of the average daily range) and then maybe use a stop on the entire position another couple of points down. If the earlier pullbacks were three points, they might instead place a limit order to buy three points down and buy more two or three points lower and use a two-point stop on the entire position. If at any time the market flipped to always-in short, they would exit the position and look to get short. Scaling in is discussed in book 2.\nFIGURE 15.1 Always-In Swing Trading Always-in trading can be a profitable swing trading approach during both trend days and trading range days, if the trading range days have large enough swings. As shown in Figure 15.1, the first day was a trading range day, and the always-in approach could have netted 52 ticks, or about $600 per contract. The second day began as a trend from the open bear and then entered a trading range. An always-in trader could have netted 79 ticks or about $950 per contract. A trader who traded two lots, scalping one and swinging one, could have had 10 successful scalps each day, yielding an additional $450 per contract per day. It sounds and looks easy, but is very difficult to do.\nFIGURE 15.2 Higher Time Frame Charts", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["the spike at this point is made of three reasonably sized bull trend bars, traders are buying at the market and on tiny pullbacks.

The bar numbering on all three charts is the same. The chart on the upper left is a 15 minute chart and the one on the bottom left has 10,000\nticks per bar.

Although some traders would have entered on the breakout of the ii pattern, most would have waited for the breakout of the opening\nrange.\nThe bar before bar 8 was a strong bull trend bar that closed above the bar 5 high, and many traders went long above that swing high. Bar 8 was\nan even larger bull trend bar and a breakout of the opening range.

The bars became small and the market entered a tight trading range for the next couple of hours, but it never\npulled back to the moving average. It tried to on the pullbacks to bars 13 and 15, but the bulls were so aggressive that they had buy limit orders\nseveral ticks above the moving average. They were so afraid that the market might not touch the moving average that they placed their buy orders\nabove it. This is a sign of a very strong bull market. However, whenever there is a long sideways correction in a strong bull trend, it will break the bull\ntrend line and it might become a final flag, as it did here. This made the bulls ready to quickly take profits. Bars 11, 13, and 15 were three pushes\ndown in a tight trading range and can be viewed as a triangle or a wedge bull flag.\nConsecutive bear trend bars breaking below a trading range will not necessarily convince traders that the always-in direction has flipped to short.\nThe two bear trend bars that broke below the tight trading range that followed bar 12 were small, and there was no prior bear strength. Traders did\nnot short and instead were looking to buy a 20 gap bar pullback to the moving average. The three bear trend bars that broke below the bar 14 lower\nhigh did not create an impressive bear spike, and the bulls were still looking to buy the first pullback to the moving average. There was no\nsignificant selling pressure leading up to this and no significant bear strength. Traders believed that the always-in direction was still long, and they\nbought the two-legged sideways correction to bar 15.\nBar 17 was another strong bull breakout and therefore also a spike and a climax, but since it might have been a breakout of a final flag, it could\nhave failed and been followed by a trend reversal. Bulls and bears look for large bull trend bars in a trend that has gone on for 20 or more bars,\nespecially if the move up is out of a potential final flag, as it was here. Traders saw the large trend bar as climactic, and suspected that a correction\nmight soon begin. Because of this, traders began to sell. The bulls sold out of their longs to take profits, and the bears sold to initiate new shorts.\nThey sold on the close of the bar, above its high, on any small bar that followed (especially if it had a bear close), and below the low of the prior bar.\nBoth the bulls and the bears expected at least a two-legged correction that would last at least 10 bars and possibly test the bottom of the bar 15\nbottom of the potential final flag. If the move down was very strong, both would have waited to buy. If it was a simple two-legged correction and the\nmarket looked poised to rally, both would have bought. The bulls would have reinstated their longs, and the bears would have bought back their\nprofitable shorts. Here, the series of bear bars down from bar 14 were likely to be followed by lower prices, and therefore there was no significant\nbuying into the close.\nBar 18 was the third push up on the day (bars 3 and 12 were the first two pushes) and a possible final flag reversal, both from the large trading\nrange between bar 11 and bar 16, which was a triangle, and from the two small bars that followed the bar 17 buy climax. It was also the third push\nup, where bars 14 and 17 were the first two pushes. The market often pulls back around 10:30 to 11:00 a.m. PST, with the pullback ending around\n11:30 a.m. Also, the market had not touched the moving average all day, although it came close at bar 15. The next pullback was likely to be\ndeeper, since subsequent pullbacks often are, especially after 11:00 a.m. PST or so, and a deeper pullback would have been so close to the\nmoving average that it would almost certainly have to penetrate it, at least by a little. This combination of factors made experienced traders wonder\nif the strong bull trend was transitioning into a trading range. There was also a chance that the pullback could become a large, deep pullback, or\neven a bear trend, since the triangle to bar 15 broke the steep trend line from the bull trend between bars 6 and 12, and bar 18 was a possible\nhigher high trend reversal. Many took their final profits below the two-bar reversal at the bar 18 high, and looked for at least a two-legged, 10 bar\ncorrection that touched the moving average before considering getting long again into the close of the day.\nBar 19 was a strong bear spike, which alerted traders to a possible bear channel after a pullback. Some traders would have reversed to short on\nthe final flag top, but since the market had not yet touched the moving average all day, there would have been 20 gap bar longs coming in at the\nmoving average. Because of this, the always-in position was probably still long. Bulls assumed that there would likely not be a bear bar for the next\nbar, so they bought at the close of the bar. Most attempts to flip the always-in position fail, especially in a strong trend.\nBar 23 was a double bottom long entry at the moving average, but became the first bar of a two-bar reversal down. The always-in position flipped\nto short for most traders once the market traded below the bar 24 low. This was a bull trap and a small final flag top (the breakout from a final flag\ncan be a lower high). The bar after bar 25 was a first moving average gap bar long setup, but the trend was now down. There was a strong bull\ntrend bar, but instead of a failed breakout below the top trading range, it failed to have follow-through and was followed by a breakout pullback short\nentry at the moving average either on bar 26 as it went outside down or below its low (shorting below a bear bar that is a moving average test\nbelow the moving average is a reliable trade).\nBy bar 27, the market was clearly always-in short, and traders were shorting at the market for the trend into the close. Risk managers were\nwalking the floors and telling their traders that they had to dump their longs. The traders hated that because they were clinging to the hope that the\nbull trend would resume and bail them out, but their boss would not allow them to wait. They and the risk managers get paid for performance, and\nthe traders can be emotionally attached to their losing longs, but the risk manager's job is to be unemotional and to accept losses when doing so\nmakes sense. The boss always wins, and the result was a bear trend into the close. The trend is enhanced by momentum sell programs that detect\nthe strong trend and sell into it, as long as the momentum down continues.\nIn the rally from bar 6 to bar 12, the biggest pullback was only about a couple of points. Experienced traders might have placed limit orders to\nscale in on any one- or two-point pullback and add on at one to two points lower, and might have risked two to three points below their final entry. If\nthe market flipped to always-in short, they would have exited their longs and looked to go short. If they bought one contract on a one-point pullback\nand added one more one point lower, they would have been long two contracts at bar 13. They could have placed their protective stops two to three\npoints lower or maybe a couple of points below the moving average. Since this was a bull trend, they expected at least a test of the high, and they\ncould have taken a one-point profit on their first contract as the market went to a new high and then either placed a limit order to exit the other\ncontract at about four points (about twice their initial risk on that entry) or exited once the market stalled around bar 18 where the market might have\nbeen setting up a final flag reversal from the bar 12 to bar 16 potential final flag.\nFIGURE 15.4 Look for Early Swing Setups\n", "text_clean": "larger sideways to down correction.

If the move down was very strong, both would have waited to buy. If it was a simple two-legged correction and the market looked poised to rally, both would have bought. The bulls would have reinstated their longs, and the bears would have bought back their profitable shorts. Here, the series of bear bars down from bar 14 were likely to be followed by lower prices, and therefore there was no significant buying into the close.\nBar 18 was the third push up on the day (bars 3 and 12 were the first two pushes) and a possible final flag reversal, both from the large trading range between bar 11 and bar 16, which was a triangle, and from the two small bars that followed the bar 17 buy climax. It was also the third push up, where bars 14 and 17 were the first two pushes. The market often pulls back around 10:30 to 11:00 a.m. PST, with the pullback ending around 11:30 a.m. Also, the market had not touched the moving average all day, although it came close at bar 15. The next pullback was likely to be deeper, since subsequent pullbacks often are, especially after 11:00 a.m. PST or so, and a deeper pullback would have been so close to the moving average that it would almost certainly have to penetrate it, at least by a little. This combination of factors made experienced traders wonder if the strong bull trend was transitioning into a trading range. There was also a chance that the pullback could become a large, deep pullback, or even a bear trend, since the triangle to bar 15 broke the steep trend line from the bull trend between bars 6 and 12, and bar 18 was a possible higher high trend reversal. Many took their final profits below the two-bar reversal at the bar 18 high, and looked for at least a two-legged, 10 bar correction that touched the moving average before considering getting long again into the close of the day.\nBar 19 was a strong bear spike, which alerted traders to a possible bear channel after a pullback. Some traders would have reversed to short on the final flag top, but since the market had not yet touched the moving average all day, there would have been 20 gap bar longs coming in at the moving average. Because of this, the always-in position was probably still long. Bulls assumed that there would likely not be a bear bar for the next bar, so they bought at the close of the bar. Most attempts to flip the always-in position fail, especially in a strong trend.\nBar 23 was a double bottom long entry at the moving average, but became the first bar of a two-bar reversal down. The always-in position flipped to short for most traders once the market traded below the bar 24 low. This was a bull trap and a small final flag top (the breakout from a final flag can be a lower high). The bar after bar 25 was a first moving average gap bar long setup, but the trend was now down. There was a strong bull trend bar, but instead of a failed breakout below the top trading range, it failed to have follow-through and was followed by a breakout pullback short entry at the moving average either on bar 26 as it went outside down or below its low (shorting below a bear bar that is a moving average test below the moving average is a reliable trade).\nBy bar 27, the market was clearly always-in short, and traders were shorting at the market for the trend into the close. Risk managers were walking the floors and telling their traders that they had to dump their longs. The traders hated that because they were clinging to the hope that the bull trend would resume and bail them out, but their boss would not allow them to wait. They and the risk managers get paid for performance, and the traders can be emotionally attached to their losing longs, but the risk manager's job is to be unemotional and to accept losses when doing so makes sense. The boss always wins, and the result was a bear trend into the close. The trend is enhanced by momentum sell programs that detect the strong trend and sell into it, as long as the momentum down continues.\nIn the rally from bar 6 to bar 12, the biggest pullback was only about a couple of points. Experienced traders might have placed limit orders to scale in on any one- or two-point pullback and add on at one to two points lower, and might have risked two to three points below their final entry. If the market flipped to always-in short, they would have exited their longs and looked to go short. If they bought one contract on a one-point pullback and added one more one point lower, they would have been long two contracts at bar 13. They could have placed their protective stops two to three points lower or maybe a couple of points below the moving average. Since this was a bull trend, they expected at least a test of the high, and they could have taken a one-point profit on their first contract as the market went to a new high and then either placed a limit order to exit the other contract at about four points (about twice their initial risk on that entry) or exited once the market stalled around bar 18 where the market might have been setting up a final flag reversal from the bar 12 to bar 16 potential final flag.\nFIGURE 15.4 Look for Early Swing Setups", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["larger sideways to down correction.

This was a sign of weakness for the bulls and a sign of strength for the bears. This one-bar\nrally could have developed into a breakout pullback, and it could have been followed by another leg down. A trader could have placed an order to\ngo short at one tick below bar 2.\nBar 3 did not fill the short order, but it had a bear close and the bar failed to go above bar 2. It therefore formed a double top with bar 2, just\nbelow the moving average, and could have led to a leg down. A trader could have shorted the close of the bar and exited above its high or reversed\nto long there, or shorted on a sell stop at one tick below its low. This would also have been shorting at one tick below the bar 2 long entry bar. Many\nof those longs would likely have been exiting at this exact location (below the entry bar), adding to the down move. If triggered, this would have\ncreated a breakout pullback and likely led to a swing down. Traders could have considered scalping one or two points, swinging the entire position\n(they would have netted six ticks), or scalping part (maybe half) and swinging part, hoping for three or four points on their swing portion.\nThe bar 4 entry bar was a strong bear trend bar and likely to form a new low of the day at a minimum. The market tried to break out above bar 1\nbut failed and was now trying to break out below its low. Since the market was below the moving average and it gapped down out of a bear flag\nfrom yesterday, the bears were strong and could create a good swing down for a measured move. Bar 2 could have ended up as the high of the\nday, and the day could have become a strong bear trend day. With this bear strength, traders could have shorted more on the bear close below the\nbar 2 long entry bar, or on a stop below the low of bar 4, or on the breakout below bar 1 to a new low of the day.\nBar 5 expanded into a large bear trend bar on the breakout below bar 1. This could have been either a sign of increased strength by the bears or\nof climactic selling. Since the bar poked below a bear trend channel line, if the market had reversed up from there it could have had at least two\nlegs up. Also, since that would have been the second attempt to reverse up from below yesterday's low and it also would have been a wedge\nreversal, it could have formed the low of the day. Traders could have shorted the close of the bar, but if they did, they had to be prepared to exit\naround breakeven if the market paused down here, and they had to be prepared to reverse to long. There was a gap down on the open and then a\npullback to the moving average and now a sell climax. This could have been a spike and climax bottom, and since the high or low of the day forms\nin the first 90 minutes or so in about 90 percent of days, traders had to look at every possible early reversal as a possible extreme of the day.\nThe low of bar 6 was only five ticks below the close of bar 5, so those bears who shorted below bar 5 came up one tick short of being able to\nscalp out one point. At this juncture, they were nervous. They might have exited above this bar, and some might even have reversed to long. Since\nthe bar was a bear trend bar, the bears were still in control, and most traders would have held short. The bar 6 low was also an exact measured\nmove down from the high and low of bar 1, and a perfect breakout test of a strong move up from two days ago (not shown).\nBar 7 was a bull two-bar reversal. This was a problem for the bears. Most would have tried to exit at breakeven, but would have been willing to\ntake a one- or two-tick loss. Some traders would have bought the bull close for a possible low of the day and a likely two-legs-up rally. Other traders\nwould have entered long on lower time frame charts and on reversals on other types of charts, like volume or tick charts. Since about half of the\nrange of bar 6 was overlapped by both the bar before and the bar after, a small trading range was forming. Countertrend trades usually have\npullbacks, so if traders bought above bar 7, they needed to hold their longs during the expected pullback and hope that it formed a higher low.\nBar 8 closed on its high, so the bulls bought into the close of the bar, indicating that they were eager to get long. However, the selling down to bar\n6 was strong, so the first attempt to reverse up was likely to fail and probably to be followed by an attempt to drive the market down. An alternative\nwas to buy this strong close. If traders believed that a second leg up was likely and they were expecting pullbacks along the way, they could have\nlooked to buy at or one or two ticks below the low of any of the next few bars, expecting a failed low 1 and a higher low.\nBar 9 was a bear reversal bar, and it was unable to close above the high of bar 8, which was a strong bull bar. There was no follow-through\nbuying. Maybe the bulls were weak and the bar 8 reversal up would fail and become a breakout pullback on the breakout below bar 1 and therefore\na low 1 short. Since the market was correcting from a wedge bottom, a second leg up was likely, so rather than shorting at one tick below bar 9,\nthose already long would have held with stops below the bar 5 signal bar. Because it was only one tick above the low of the day, they would\nprobably have put their stops one tick lower at just below the low of the day. Some bulls who hadn't yet bought would have waited to buy a higher\nlow, if one formed. Aggressive bulls would have bought on limit orders at the low of bar 9, thinking that the market would probably have to dip one\ntick below its low for those long limit orders to get filled, and if the market reversed up from there, the bears would be trapped short on a one-tick\nfailure and they would be very eager to get out and help drive the market up. Other bulls would have placed limit orders to go long at one, two, or\nthree ticks below the low of bar 9. All of these orders would have given support to the market. If the market dipped one tick below bar 9 and then\nbounced up two or three ticks within the next few seconds, some bulls who had limit orders to buy at one or two ticks lower would have moved their\nlong limit orders up by a tick or two because they would have become more eager to get in when they saw the market failing to sell off. Bar 9 was a\nbad low 1 short setup, and therefore a higher low was likely. The market had a strong bear spike, which is needed for a low 1, but it was not clearly\nin a bear trend, which is also needed before shorting a low 1. Also, a trader should not short a low 1 after a sell climax, and this was possibly one.\nThe bears saw bar 10 as a double top in a bear trend and hoped that it would have resulted in a move similar to the move that followed the bars\n2 and 3 double top. However, they were concerned about that wedge bottom and would have exited any new shorts quickly if the market did not fall\nsharply, as it did earlier in the day.\nBar 11 fell two ticks below bar 9 and then rallied up sharply. The bulls who tried to buy at the low of bar 9 and at one tick below it were happy to\nbe long, and those who wanted to buy at two or three ticks below bar 9 were afraid that they had missed their chance. They were changing their\nlimit orders to market orders, which caused bar 11 to move up quickly. Also, those bears who shorted below bar 9 were afraid that the low 1 would\nfail and that the wedge would have a second leg up, so they were now covering at the market or above the highs of 1, 2, or 3 minute bars, or above\nbars on volume or tick charts. Bar 11 closed above the closes of the past six bars (a sign of strength), and it was essentially an outside up bar at\nthe start of a possible new bull trend. Some bulls would have bought this strong close, given that it followed strength in bars 7 and 8 and the trend\nmight have reversed up. It failed to have a high above the high of the prior bar, but with a low below the prior bar and a high at the high of that bar, it\nwas close enough for the market to react to it as if it was an outside bar. At this point, it was a triple top with the two prior bars, and if the market\nfailed to reverse down and instead went one tick higher, the pattern would have become a failed top and would likely be followed by more buying.\nBar 11 also broke below the trend line from bars 6 and 7 and below the trend channel line from bars 9 and 10, and this created a small dueling lines\nlong setup. Bars 9, 10, and 11 formed a small expanding triangle that should have acted as a bull flag instead of a reversal pattern because a\nsecond leg up was likely.\nBar 12 broke out above the triple top and above the high of the bar 11 outside up bar. Even though it was a small bar, it reached two ticks above\nthe triple top. If it reversed down after just a one-tick breakout, traders would have viewed that as a possible bull trap and they would have looked to\nexit longs. Bears would also have shorted it as a two-legged bear rally. Some bears would have placed orders to go short at one tick below this\nbar, in case it became a low 2 short. However, with its high so close to the moving average, they would have felt more confident about their shorts if\n", "text_clean": "and its high was only four ticks below yesterday's close and the moving average, so there might not have been enough room for a buy scalp.\nTraders who bought above bar 1 saw the weak close on the entry bar, and many would have exited around breakeven.\nBar 2 was a doji, and it could not close above bar 1. This was a sign of weakness for the bulls and a sign of strength for the bears. This one-bar rally could have developed into a breakout pullback, and it could have been followed by another leg down. A trader could have placed an order to go short at one tick below bar 2.\nBar 3 did not fill the short order, but it had a bear close and the bar failed to go above bar 2. It therefore formed a double top with bar 2, just below the moving average, and could have led to a leg down. A trader could have shorted the close of the bar and exited above its high or reversed to long there, or shorted on a sell stop at one tick below its low. This would also have been shorting at one tick below the bar 2 long entry bar. Many of those longs would likely have been exiting at this exact location (below the entry bar), adding to the down move. If triggered, this would have created a breakout pullback and likely led to a swing down.

The market tried to break out above bar 1 but failed and was now trying to break out below its low. Since the market was below the moving average and it gapped down out of a bear flag from yesterday, the bears were strong and could create a good swing down for a measured move. Bar 2 could have ended up as the high of the day, and the day could have become a strong bear trend day. With this bear strength, traders could have shorted more on the bear close below the bar 2 long entry bar, or on a stop below the low of bar 4, or on the breakout below bar 1 to a new low of the day.\nBar 5 expanded into a large bear trend bar on the breakout below bar 1. This could have been either a sign of increased strength by the bears or of climactic selling. Since the bar poked below a bear trend channel line, if the market had reversed up from there it could have had at least two legs up. Also, since that would have been the second attempt to reverse up from below yesterday's low and it also would have been a wedge reversal, it could have formed the low of the day. Traders could have shorted the close of the bar, but if they did, they had to be prepared to exit around breakeven if the market paused down here, and they had to be prepared to reverse to long. There was a gap down on the open and then a pullback to the moving average and now a sell climax. This could have been a spike and climax bottom, and since the high or low of the day forms in the first 90 minutes or so in about 90 percent of days, traders had to look at every possible early reversal as a possible extreme of the day.\nThe low of bar 6 was only five ticks below the close of bar 5, so those bears who shorted below bar 5 came up one tick short of being able to scalp out one point. At this juncture, they were nervous. They might have exited above this bar, and some might even have reversed to long. Since the bar was a bear trend bar, the bears were still in control, and most traders would have held short. The bar 6 low was also an exact measured move down from the high and low of bar 1, and a perfect breakout test of a strong move up from two days ago (not shown).\nBar 7 was a bull two-bar reversal. This was a problem for the bears. Most would have tried to exit at breakeven, but would have been willing to take a one- or two-tick loss. Some traders would have bought the bull close for a possible low of the day and a likely two-legs-up rally. Other traders would have entered long on lower time frame charts and on reversals on other types of charts, like volume or tick charts. Since about half of the range of bar 6 was overlapped by both the bar before and the bar after, a small trading range was forming. Countertrend trades usually have pullbacks, so if traders bought above bar 7, they needed to hold their longs during the expected pullback and hope that it formed a higher low.\nBar 8 closed on its high, so the bulls bought into the close of the bar, indicating that they were eager to get long. However, the selling down to bar 6 was strong, so the first attempt to reverse up was likely to fail and probably to be followed by an attempt to drive the market down. An alternative was to buy this strong close. If traders believed that a second leg up was likely and they were expecting pullbacks along the way, they could have looked to buy at or one or two ticks below the low of any of the next few bars, expecting a failed low 1 and a higher low.\nBar 9 was a bear reversal bar, and it was unable to close above the high of bar 8, which was a strong bull bar. There was no follow-through buying. Maybe the bulls were weak and the bar 8 reversal up would fail and become a breakout pullback on the breakout below bar 1 and therefore a low 1 short. Since the market was correcting from a wedge bottom, a second leg up was likely, so rather than shorting at one tick below bar 9, those already long would have held with stops below the bar 5 signal bar. Because it was only one tick above the low of the day, they would probably have put their stops one tick lower at just below the low of the day. Some bulls who hadn't yet bought would have waited to buy a higher low, if one formed. Aggressive bulls would have bought on limit orders at the low of bar 9, thinking that the market would probably have to dip one tick below its low for those long limit orders to get filled, and if the market reversed up from there, the bears would be trapped short on a one-tick failure and they would be very eager to get out and help drive the market up. Other bulls would have placed limit orders to go long at one, two, or three ticks below the low of bar 9. All of these orders would have given support to the market. If the market dipped one tick below bar 9 and then bounced up two or three ticks within the next few seconds, some bulls who had limit orders to buy at one or two ticks lower would have moved their long limit orders up by a tick or two because they would have become more eager to get in when they saw the market failing to sell off. Bar 9 was a bad low 1 short setup, and therefore a higher low was likely. The market had a strong bear spike, which is needed for a low 1, but it was not clearly in a bear trend, which is also needed before shorting a low 1. Also, a trader should not short a low 1 after a sell climax, and this was possibly one.\nThe bears saw bar 10 as a double top in a bear trend and hoped that it would have resulted in a move similar to the move that followed the bars 2 and 3 double top. However, they were concerned about that wedge bottom and would have exited any new shorts quickly if the market did not fall sharply, as it did earlier in the day.\nBar 11 fell two ticks below bar 9 and then rallied up sharply. The bulls who tried to buy at the low of bar 9 and at one tick below it were happy to be long, and those who wanted to buy at two or three ticks below bar 9 were afraid that they had missed their chance. They were changing their limit orders to market orders, which caused bar 11 to move up quickly. Also, those bears who shorted below bar 9 were afraid that the low 1 would fail and that the wedge would have a second leg up, so they were now covering at the market or above the highs of 1, 2, or 3 minute bars, or above bars on volume or tick charts. Bar 11 closed above the closes of the past six bars (a sign of strength), and it was essentially an outside up bar at the start of a possible new bull trend. Some bulls would have bought this strong close, given that it followed strength in bars 7 and 8 and the trend might have reversed up. It failed to have a high above the high of the prior bar, but with a low below the prior bar and a high at the high of that bar, it was close enough for the market to react to it as if it was an outside bar. At this point, it was a triple top with the two prior bars, and if the market failed to reverse down and instead went one tick higher, the pattern would have become a failed top and would likely be followed by more buying.\nBar 11 also broke below the trend line from bars 6 and 7 and below the trend channel line from bars 9 and 10, and this created a small dueling lines long setup. Bars 9, 10, and 11 formed a small expanding triangle that should have acted as a bull flag instead of a reversal pattern because a second leg up was likely.\nBar 12 broke out above the triple top and above the high of the bar 11 outside up bar. Even though it was a small bar, it reached two ticks above the triple top. If it reversed down after just a one-tick breakout, traders would have viewed that as a possible bull trap and they would have looked to exit longs. Bears would also have shorted it as a two-legged bear rally. Some bears would have placed orders to go short at one tick below this bar, in case it became a low 2 short.

Many would not have looked to short until after the moving average was touched, because until it was\ntouched, they would have worried that the market might just go sideways until it was tested. When the market gets within a tick or so of a magnet,\ntraders do not feel confident about the test unless the market gets that extra tick and actually touches the magnet. Until that happens, they usually\nwill not aggressively trade it as a completed pullback. Some bulls would have added to longs above this bar, thinking that it was a failed chance for\nthe bears to take control, which made the market more likely to go up. The high of bar 12 was two ticks below the low of bar 3 and missed the\nbreakeven stops on those shorts by one tick. If the market sold off here, this would have created a perfect breakout test (perfect because it tested\nthose stops as closely as it could without actually hitting them). If instead the market went one tick higher, this breakout test would have failed; those\nremaining shorts would have covered, and their buying would have propelled the market upward. Longs knew this and would have placed buy stops\nto add to their longs at exactly that price to profit from that short covering.\nBar 13 was a strong bull breakout bar, with the market breaking and closing well above the moving average, the bear trend line, and the high of\nthe strong bar 5 bear trend bar. The bear flag failed and broke to the upside, and traders would have looked for about a measured move up. If it\nwas a successful bear flag, they would have expected a test of the low of the day. Once it failed, they would have looked for it to go up for about the\nsame number of points. Bulls would have bought this close for a test of the high of the day. The day's range had been only five points, which was\nabout half of the recent average daily range, so the market could have formed a measured move up or down. At this point, since the bears had just\ncovered, they would have been unlikely to go short until at least two more attempts up and that would have left the bulls in control for the next few\nbars. If there was to be a measured move, up was more likely than down at this point.\nBar 14 was a bear reversal bar that could have formed a lower high, a failed breakout, and a low 2 short. However, for the reasons just stated, it\nwas more likely that the market would have at least two attempts up after the bar 13 breakout, so if this short triggered, it would be more likely to\nfail, and the failure would create a breakout pullback long. The bulls would therefore have been trying to buy any move below its low. If there was\ngoing to be just a one-tick move below its low, forming a one-tick bear trap, aggressive bulls would have wanted to buy that move. To do so, they\nwould have put their limit orders to go long at the low of bar 14. This is because there probably would not be enough bears shorting below bar 14 to\nfill all of those long limit orders placed by aggressive bulls. Since the bulls were in control, there would probably have been more traders looking to\nbuy than looking to sell. Alternatively, the bulls could have placed a market if touched buy order below the bar or simply bought at the market as\nsoon as the market dipped below bar 14. Other bulls would have placed limit orders to go long at two and three ticks below.\nOthers would have wanted to buy two- and three-point pullbacks and would have placed limit orders to go long at seven ticks and 11 ticks below\nthe bar 14 high. If the market pulled back exactly two points, most traders trying to buy the end of that pullback would have only been able to get long\nat seven ticks down and not at the exact low, because there would likely have been far more contracts being bid than being offered at the low tick,\nand those bulls would instead have had to buy one tick higher.\nFinally, some bulls would have seen every bear setup as a bull setup and would have assumed that there would have been trapped eager bears\nwho shorted into the bear close. Those bears would have had to buy back their shorts at some point, and many would have had their buy stops at\none tick above this bear reversal bar. Smart bulls knew this and were always trying to go long exactly at the price where trapped bears would have\nbeen buying back their shorts. These longs would therefore have placed buy stops at one tick above bar 14.\nBar 15 took out the high of the bar 14 bear reversal bar, but pulled back on the close. It was possible that the bars 14 and 15 double bottom\ncould fail to be a bull flag and lead to a sell-off, just like what happened with the bars 2 and 3 double bottom. Also, the high of the bar formed a\ndouble top with the high of the open, so the day could have turned into a double top bear flag and could have a measured move below the low of the\nday. The highs of bars 13, 14, and 15 created a micro wedge. If it triggered, by the market moving below the bar 15 low, there could have been a\ntwo-legged sideways to down correction. If the market instead broke to the upside, the move up would have been a breakout to a new high of the\nday and above a micro wedge, and there would have been more bears covering their shorts and new bulls scalping the breakout.\nBar 16 was a big range breakout bar that broke a trend channel line. It could have been a buy climax and it could have been followed by at least a\ntwo-legged sideways to down correction that could have lasted an hour or more. Whenever there is a large bull trend bar after a bull trend has gone\non for a while, the odds favor it representing exhaustion, with the last weak bulls buying, the last weak shorts covering, and the strong bulls and\nbears waiting for the close of a large bull trend bar like this to sell (the bulls selling their longs to take profits, and the bears initiating new shorts).\nThe remaining shorts would have exited only on a pullback, and the strong bulls would have bought again only after a pullback. This would be similar\nto the sell climax that bar 5 represented. The high of bar 16 was just five ticks below yesterday's high, which is always a resistance area, and\ntherefore traders looking to buy above the high of this bar for a scalp would have been concerned that the market would have to go above that\nresistance for them to make their one-point profit. Some bulls would have bought the close of this bar because they could have exited with a one-\npoint profit on an exact test of yesterday's high. An exact test was more likely than a breakout above the high, but a lower high was even more likely,\nespecially after a trend channel line overshoot. Some new bulls would have been quick to exit their longs on any hesitation or pullback because they\nwouldn't want to lose even one tick when they bought a possible buy climax in an area of resistance. Others would have used a wider stop and\nadded on as the market went against them. These traders would have ultimately been successful. Aggressive bears would have shorted the close\nof bar 16, or at or above its high, and would have scaled in higher, risking about as many ticks as there were in bar 16. Since it was two points tall,\nthey might have risked two points to make one point, and they would have tried to sell more at one point above the close or high of bar 16. They\nwere unable to scale in higher, but were able to scalp out with a one-point profit on the bar 26 strong bear trend bar. Their profit taking contributed\nto the reversal up after bar 26. Remember, all traders look at every tick as both a buy and a sell setup, and constantly assess the trader's equation\nfor both possible trades. There are many times every day where both bulls and bears can enter for a scalp and both make money, if they manage\ntheir trades correctly. The close of bar 16 is an example.\nBar 17 reversed down after moving three ticks above bar 16. Those late bulls were quick to exit, and aggressive bears were beginning to short.\nBar 17 became a strong bear reversal bar, and bears would have looked to short at its close and at one tick below its low. Other bears would have\nalready shorted on smaller time frame charts. This was one bear setup that the bulls wouldn't buy. Once the market fell below the bar 17 low, the\nbulls saw that as a failed breakout above the bull trend channel line, and they and the bears expected a two-legged correction that would last an\nhour or more. Bulls would not have looked to buy aggressively until the correction was complete. Since traders were looking for a two-legged\ncorrection, bears would have started placing limit orders to short a lower high. The move up to bar 17 was a strong bull spike, so bulls were hoping\nfor a bull channel and a measured move up that would have about as many points as the spike from the low of bar 6 or bar 11 to the bar 17 high.\nBar 18 did not trigger a short and became a bull inside bar. Since traders were expecting a two-legged correction, smart bulls wouldn't have\nbeen looking to buy above its high, and aggressive bears would have had limit orders to go short at its high and one and two ticks higher with a\nstop above the bar 17 bear reversal bar high.\nBar 19 did not fill those short limit orders at the bar 18 high, and it also did not trigger the sell stops below the bars 17 and 18 low.

It was possible that the bars 14 and 15 double bottom could fail to be a bull flag and lead to a sell-off, just like what happened with the bars 2 and 3 double bottom. Also, the high of the bar formed a double top with the high of the open, so the day could have turned into a double top bear flag and could have a measured move below the low of the day.

Smart money was still looking to short below bar 17 (which was\nbelow the iii), and on a lower high.\nBar 21 might have been the bull trap that everyone was expecting. It was the second leg up (bar 18 was the first) and it extended one tick above\nbar 18, where other mistaken bulls also likely went long. There were not any trapped bears, because the most conservative bears would have\nentered on a stop below bar 17 and that had not yet happened. The only bears in the market now were the smart, aggressive ones who were\nhoping for a lower high bull trap. They wanted trapped bulls in the market because if the market went down, these bulls would have to sell out of their\nlongs, and this would add to the selling. Also, after there were trapped bulls, bulls would have wanted to wait for more price action before looking to\nbuy again. Smart bulls were already waiting for a two-legged correction, so there was no serious buying here. Weak bulls mistakenly bought the iii\npattern. Smart bears were shorting at 1, 2, and 3 ticks above the iii pattern with a protective stop above the high of bar 17. Bears would have\nlooked to short below this bar and especially below bar 17, which was a strong bear reversal bar. Most bears would have waited to short below bar\n17 because they would see that as a confirmation of the top. However, smart bears were only looking for a scalp since the move up had been\nstrong, and the day's range was still smaller than average. At this point, if the range was to expand, up was much more likely than down. Also,\neveryone believed that the buy climax was most likely a pause that would be followed by at least one more leg up. This sideways to down correction\nhad the potential to create a final flag and then a swing down, but that would happen only after an upside breakout.\nBar 22 turned bar 21 into a lower high final flag short (the iii descending triangle was the final flag), but the bar was not able to extend below the iii\npattern and bring in additional shorts who were looking to enter on a stop below the flag and below bar 17. Also, the bar closed in its middle, which\nmeans that traders bought into the close of the bar, which was the opposite of what should have happened if the bears were in control.\nThe sideways correction was continuing at bar 25 and the market was forming a tight trading range, which is a breakout setup. The bears would\nhave preferred that the market fell below bar 17 within a bar or two of its formation, which would have indicated that there was an urgency to sell.\nThe market was correcting sideways instead of down, and this is a sign of bull strength. Also, the market was now only two ticks above the moving\naverage, and since the market might have found support there and because the correction was 10 bars long, bulls would have begun to look to\nreestablish their longs. This was a problem for the bears. They were originally expecting a high percentage bear scalp and now the chance of\nsuccess had become less. They would have been quick to cover if a bear breakout stalled. Bar 25 touched the bar 17 and 21 bear trend line and\ncreated a descending triangle, which is a bull flag when it occurs in a bull trend. However, bars 21 through 25 were also in a small channel if you use\nthe bodies of the bars. A channel often has three pushes and then tries to reverse, just like a wedge. Bars 22 and 24 were two pushes down, so\nthere might have been only one more push down and therefore a downside breakout of the triangle might fail.\nBar 26 was a bear breakout that closed on its low and below the moving average. The new bears were hoping that the market would fill their\nprofit-taking limit orders just a couple of ticks lower. However, the bear trend bar closed only one tick below the moving average, and a strong\nbreakout would have closed several ticks below, just as the bar 13 bull breakout closed several ticks above the moving average. It was also an\nexact test of the breakout above the high of the open. Even the aggressive bears who shorted the close of the bar 21 bull trend bar had not yet been\nable to scalp out one point; and if the market reversed up here, they would have had a five-tick failure and would have bought back their shorts. The\nbears who shorted the close of bar 16 or above its high bought back their shorts here. The bulls saw bar 26 as an attempt by the bears to flip the\nmarket to always-in short, but they knew that most reversal attempts fail. They believed that the bears needed the next bar to be a strong bear trend\nbar to convince traders that the market had reversed its always-in position. Since the bull trend was so strong, they doubted that the bears would\nsucceed, and were not even confident that the bears would be able to push the market below the low of the bar 26 bear trend bar. Because of this,\nthey bought on the close of the bear trend bar, and they would have bought more below its low. Other bulls would have had limit orders to buy seven\nticks below the bar 17 high because they were trying to buy two- and three-point pullbacks in a bull trend.\nBar 27 was a bull inside bar and could have been setting up a high 2 long at the moving average. It would have been a two-legged correction that\nlasted about 10 bars, which was about long enough for the bulls. The bulls wanted a channel up after the spike up to the bar 17 high, and this\npullback to the moving average could have been the beginning. It would also have been a breakout test of the bar 2 high. It could also have been\nseen as a breakout pullback and bears would have shorted below its low, which would also have been the low of the bar 26 bear breakout bar. The\nbears wanted a bear body to increase the chances of the always-in direction flipping to short. Once traders saw the bull close, they assumed that\nthe bears failed and that the always-in direction remained up, and they bought the close and above the bar.\nBar 28 was a second bull inside bar and formed an ii pattern. At this point, traders were wondering if the trading range was continuing, if the\nbreakout was pausing before more selling came in, or if the breakout had failed and the bulls would take control again.\nBar 29 was a bull breakout of the ii pattern and a successful test of the moving average and of the breakout of the opening range. However, it\nwas only a one-tick breakout and a small bear trend bar, and it could easily have set up a short as a pullback from the bar 26 bear breakout. Bears\nwould have placed orders to short below its low. However, all of the bears who had been shorting for the past hour were now concerned that the\nmarket had an opportunity to give them a scalper's profit and it failed. They would not have held on to their shorts much longer. They would have had\nbuy stops above the bar 26 bear trend bar high; the bars 23, 24, 25 triple top; the bar 21 lower high; the bar 17 bull climax high; and yesterday's\nhigh. Since all of these stops were within a tick or two of each other, the stops could have been quickly hit in a cascade of stop running, resulting in\nthe bears giving up and the bulls taking control of the market.\nBar 30 took out the high of bar 29 and broke above the bear trend line by a tick, but failed to break above the bar 26 short entry bar. This was two\nlegs up, and the bears would have allowed that as an acceptable pullback from the bear breakout, but they would have been concerned that their\nshorts were not behaving well. They would have been quick to buy back their shorts. The bulls knew that the correction had two legs and had now\nlasted about 10 bars, so their minimum criteria had been met and they were getting ready to buy aggressively, hoping for a measured move up to\nthe 1,127.50 area. This was far enough up for them to be swinging some or all of their new positions. They would have seen each of those bear\nstops as buy setups and would have been buying at the exact same prices at which the bears were covering their shorts. With both bulls and bears\nbuying at the same prices as the market went up, the market should have accelerated upward. Some bulls also viewed this trading range as a\nwedge bull flag with bar 17 as the first push down, bar 20 as the second, and bar 26 as the third. They also saw the third push down as being\ncomposed of a smaller wedge, with bars 22, 24, and 26 forming the three pushes down.\nBars 32 and 33 were small dojis and were a sign that traders were deciding to run those buy stops. At this point, bears were beginning to cover\nat the market because they knew that their shorts were only countertrend scalps. They were likely happy to get out at breakeven or even with a one-\nor two-tick loss. The market was holding above the moving average, and after a big spike up, that was bullish.\nBar 34 was a bull trend bar, but it closed a couple of ticks off its high. The market found sellers at the bar 17 high and in the area of the high of\nyesterday.\nBar 35 gave the bulls a scalper's profit, but formed a bear reversal bar with a one-tick new high of the day.

They would have covered their shorts at the close of the bar and above its high. Some bulls would have gone long above its high, but\nmost would not have because it would have been buying near the high of the day when the day had been in a trading range for a couple of hours.\nBuying the high of the day is a good strategy only in strong bull trends, and that was not the current price action.\nBar 37 was a bull trend bar, but it is bad to buy above three large bars that mostly overlap. The three bars create a trading range, and it is risky to\nbuy at the top of a trading range since most breakouts fail. If anything, it was better to short up there.\nBar 38 reversed down at five ticks above the bar 36 long signal bar and one tick above the high of yesterday. Many bulls who were long from\nearlier in the day likely had limit orders to take profits at yesterday's high, and aggressive bears would have shorted there as well. The bar 37 longs\nwould likely have moved their stops to around breakeven after the five-tick move up, and the market fell through those stops. Bar 38 became a\nlarge bear reversal bar, but since it overlapped the prior four bars by so much, it was forming more of a trading range than a reversal. This was the\nsecond attempt to reverse the high of the open, so some traders would have placed stops to go short at one tick below this bear reversal bar.\nOthers would have looked to short a lower high. The move up to the bar 38 high can be seen as a two-legged higher high after a bull trend line\nbreak, and therefore it was a possible trend reversal. Because of this, bulls might have waited for a two-legged correction before buying again.\nBar 39 was a doji inside bar. Bears would still have tried to short below the bar 38 low, and now other bears would have placed limit orders to\nshort a lower high. They would have had limit orders to go short at the bar 39 high and at one or two ticks higher. Overly eager bulls would have\nseen this as a high 2 buy setup (bar 37 being the high 1) and would have gone long exactly where aggressive bears were shorting. The market was\nnow in the middle third of the day and was more likely to have trading ranges, so bulls had to be patient, and they had to avoid buying at the high\nunless the market became very strong again.\nBar 41 again lacked strength, and those early bulls who bought bar 40 would have been quick to take a two-tick loss if the market fell below the\nlow of this bar. Bears would have shorted there for a possible lower high, but they would not have been enthusiastic, because the market was\nstarting to form overlapping small bars with tails (which is barbwire behavior), and breakout entries would have been more likely to fail. It is usually\nbetter to buy breakouts near the bottom of barbwire and short breakouts near the top.\nBar 42 would have made some of those high 2 longs cover, and the rest would have covered below bar 38 and the signal bar low.\nBar 43 would have made traders wonder if the market was setting up a wedge bull flag. A small, sideways head and shoulders top often\nbecomes a triangle or a wedge bull flag, and bars 35 and 40 were shoulders. Since traders were looking for a wedge bull flag, they were trying to\nfind three pushes down and a high 3 long setup. Bars 36 and 38 were the first two. Bar 42 could have been the start of the third push down, and if\nthere was a reversal up from there, the wedge bull flag (and the failed head and shoulders top) would have triggered.\nBar 44 broke out below the bar 36 low by one tick and tested the breakout above bar 27 and the moving average. It could be a signal bar\nalthough it had a bear body (signal bars often look bad in trading ranges). Traders really need a good signal bar only when looking to trade\ncountertrend in a strong trend, and signal bars often look weak most of the rest of the time. Aggressive bulls had limit orders in to buy at the low of\nbar 36, expecting that any break below it would fail within a few ticks. Other bulls would have bought the high 3 above this bar because it would\nhave been a wedge bull flag. This would also have been a five-tick bear trap if the market went above the high of bar 44, forcing trapped bears to\nbuy back their shorts.\nBar 45 triggered the buying, even though it went only one tick above the bar 44 high. The market often lacks momentum in the middle third of the\nday even though the actual shape of the price action is usually reliable. Other traders would have bought above bar 45 because they saw it as a\ntwo-bar reversal. Also, many traders prefer to buy above bull bars because the bull close means that the market has already moved at least a little\nin their direction.\nBar 49 gave the bulls a one-point scalp, but many bulls kept buying every signal, scalping part and swinging the rest. The strong parabolic surge\nup to the bar 17 high could have been a spike, and the two-sided trading since then was finding support at the moving average and could have\nbeen forming a channel. The swing longs kept buying and were trailing their protective stops below the most recent swing low, which was bar 44.\nThere were many more similar trades over the remainder of the day, but this illustrates the point that if traders have the ability to focus intensely\nand read clearly, they can take dozens of scalps all day long. However, extreme scalping would be a losing strategy for most traders, and they\nshould not attempt it, and they should never be using a risk that is greater than their reward. Instead, they should restrict themselves to any of the\nmany other approaches that are far more likely to be successful and easier to execute. This chapter is here simply to illustrate that there is much\nmore happening on every chart than what might appear to be the case, and how traders need to be thinking constantly throughout the day. There\nwere many setups today where a trader could go for a reward that was at least as large as his risk, but he should be thinking about every setup that\nhe sees. This chart illustrates just how many decisions that a trader can make during the day.

The market was now in the middle third of the day and was more likely to have trading ranges, so bulls had to be patient, and they had to avoid buying at the high unless the market became very strong again.\nBar 41 again lacked strength, and those early bulls who bought bar 40 would have been quick to take a two-tick loss if the market fell below the low of this bar. Bears would have shorted there for a possible lower high, but they would not have been enthusiastic, because the market was starting to form overlapping small bars with tails (which is barbwire behavior), and breakout entries would have been more likely to fail. It is usually better to buy breakouts near the bottom of barbwire and short breakouts near the top.\nBar 42 would have made some of those high 2 longs cover, and the rest would have covered below bar 38 and the signal bar low.\nBar 43 would have made traders wonder if the market was setting up a wedge bull flag. A small, sideways head and shoulders top often becomes a triangle or a wedge bull flag, and bars 35 and 40 were shoulders. Since traders were looking for a wedge bull flag, they were trying to find three pushes down and a high 3 long setup. Bars 36 and 38 were the first two. Bar 42 could have been the start of the third push down, and if there was a reversal up from there, the wedge bull flag (and the failed head and shoulders top) would have triggered.\nBar 44 broke out below the bar 36 low by one tick and tested the breakout above bar 27 and the moving average. It could be a signal bar although it had a bear body (signal bars often look bad in trading ranges). Traders really need a good signal bar only when looking to trade countertrend in a strong trend, and signal bars often look weak most of the rest of the time. Aggressive bulls had limit orders in to buy at the low of bar 36, expecting that any break below it would fail within a few ticks. Other bulls would have bought the high 3 above this bar because it would have been a wedge bull flag. This would also have been a five-tick bear trap if the market went above the high of bar 44, forcing trapped bears to buy back their shorts.\nBar 45 triggered the buying, even though it went only one tick above the bar 44 high. The market often lacks momentum in the middle third of the day even though the actual shape of the price action is usually reliable. Other traders would have bought above bar 45 because they saw it as a two-bar reversal. Also, many traders prefer to buy above bull bars because the bull close means that the market has already moved at least a little in their direction.\nBar 49 gave the bulls a one-point scalp, but many bulls kept buying every signal, scalping part and swinging the rest. The strong parabolic surge up to the bar 17 high could have been a spike, and the two-sided trading since then was finding support at the moving average and could have been forming a channel. The swing longs kept buying and were trailing their protective stops below the most recent swing low, which was bar 44.\nThere were many more similar trades over the remainder of the day, but this illustrates the point that if traders have the ability to focus intensely and read clearly, they can take dozens of scalps all day long. However, extreme scalping would be a losing strategy for most traders, and they should not attempt it, and they should never be using a risk that is greater than their reward. Instead, they should restrict themselves to any of the many other approaches that are far more likely to be successful and easier to execute. This chapter is here simply to illustrate that there is much more happening on every chart than what might appear to be the case, and how traders need to be thinking constantly throughout the day. There were many setups today where a trader could go for a reward that was at least as large as his risk, but he should be thinking about every setup that he sees.

He said that he studied his results and discovered that he made 85 percent of his profits in the first hour and decided that he just\ndrained himself emotionally during the rest of the day, and sometimes this carried over into the next day. Because of this, he stopped trading after\nthe first hour or so several years ago and was doing very well trading just the first hour.\nHere are some of the characteristics of the first hour:\nWhat is referred to as the first hour is rarely an hour. It is the time before the first good swing begins and can be 15 minutes or two hours;\nit is often called the opening range.\nIt is the easiest time to make money. Experienced scalpers know that reversals are common. These traders can often make many\ncarefully selected scalps, betting that breakout attempts will usually fail, as is typical of breakout attempts at any time of the day. They\nlook to buy low and sell high. In general, they avoid doji signal bars, but will often short below either a bull or a bear trend bar after a\nmove up, or buy above a bull or a bear trend bar after a move down. Consecutive trend bars in the same direction often indicate the\ndirection of their next scalp. Two consecutive, strong bull trend bars will usually make scalpers look to buy, and consecutive bear trend\nbars will bias them in favor of shorts.\nIt is the easiest time to lose money. Beginners see large trend bars and are afraid of missing a huge breakout. They buy late, at the top\nof strong bull spikes, and short late, at the bottom of strong bear spikes, only to take repeated losses. There are more variables to\nconsider, and the setups come faster. Because they often confuse swing and scalp setups, they end up managing their trades wrong.\nThey should never scalp, especially in the first hour.\nWhen the bars are big, traders should use wider stops and trade smaller size.\nYesterday's always-in direction going into the close often carries over into the open of today.\nReversals are common, abrupt, and often large. If you can't read the price action fast enough, wait until the market slows down and the\nalways-in direction becomes clear.\nThe first bar of the day is the high or low of the day only about 20 percent of the time, so don't feel a need to enter on the second bar. In\nfact, there is no need to rush to take any trade, because before long the always-in direction will be clear, and the probability of a\nsuccessful trade will be higher.\nEither the high or low of the day usually forms within the first hour, so swing traders patiently wait for a setup that can be one of the\nextremes of the day. The setup for the high or low of the day often has only a 40 percent probability of success. Since the reward can be\nmany times larger than the risk, the trader's equation can still be excellent for a swing trade. Most traders should focus on a logical\nreversal in the opening range for their most important trade of the day. The trade often looks bad for five or more bars, but then suddenly\nbreaks out and the always-in direction becomes clear to most traders. On most days, a trader will have to take more than one reversal\nbefore catching a successful swing, but even the ones that don't go far usually make a small profit or have only a small loss. This creates\na favorable trader's equation for this particular type of relatively low-probability trade.\nThe high of the day usually begins with some type of double top, although it is rarely exact. The low of the day usually begins with an\nimperfect double bottom of some type.\nOnce the always-in direction becomes clear, traders can enter at the market or on any small pullback for a swing. Experienced scalpers\nlook for pullbacks to scalp in the direction of the trend.\nTrading in the minutes after a report is dominated by computer programs, many of which get a nearly instantaneous numerical version of\nthe report and use the data to generate trades. Other programs trade off statistics and not fundamentals. It is very difficult to compete in\nan environment where your opponent has the edge of being much faster at making decisions and placing trades. It is better to wait for a\nbar or two before entering.\nGap openings are present on most days (see Chapter 20 on gap openings).\nThe open often foretells the type of day. If the first bar is a doji or the first several bars overlap and have prominent tails, the day is more\nlikely to have lots of two-sided trading.\nThere are often reports at 7:00 a.m. PST. Even if a report is not listed on the Internet, the market usually behaves as if there was a report.\nComputers have a clear edge in speed of analysis and order placement, and they are your competitors. When your competition has a big\nadvantage, don't compete. Wait for their edge to disappear and trade when speed is no longer important.\nThe first hour or, more accurately, the opening range is the time when the market is setting up the first trend of the day, and it ends once that trend\nbegins. It often lasts for a couple of hours and sometimes is as short as 15 minutes. It is the easiest time to make money, but is the easiest time to\nlose money as well. This is because many traders cannot process all of the variables fast enough, and the information is limited, since there are not\nmany bars yet in the day. They have to decide on whether to treat a trade as a swing, a scalp, or both, and have to base the decision on the three\ntrader's equation variables of probability, risk, and reward, in an environment when there are usually economic reports, where reversals and\ntherefore decisions come often, and where the bars are often unusually large and therefore require them to adjust their risk to much larger than\nnormal, as opposed to other times during the day when risk is a variable that is usually fixed at a certain size and does not usually require much\nthought. Get the picture? A trader has more to think about and less time to do the thinking. Computers have a clear edge in speed of analysis and\norder placement, and they are your competitors. When your competition has a big advantage, don't compete. If you are thinking, “Boy, I wish that I\nhad the speed advantage that the firms using computers for program trading have,” then you realize that you are at a disadvantage. Wait for their\nedge to disappear and trade when speed is no longer important.\nTrading is difficult enough and the edge is always small, and the added complexity of the first hour can push traders beyond their ability to trade\neffectively. If there are too many variables to consider to trade profitably, traders can increase their chances of success by reducing the number of\nvariables. For example, they can decide to look only for high-probability scalps or for only likely swing setups, or they can wait until there is a clear\nalways-in trade and then swing, or take scalps in that direction, entering on pullbacks.

{"book": "REVERSAL", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\reversal3.pdf", "page_index": 139, "text_raw": "use a protective stop that is beyond the signal bar, which often requires a stop that is two or more times larger than their usual size.\nOne of the biggest causes of losses is a trader's inability to distinguish between swing and scalp setups. From the trader's equation, readers\nknow that scalpers generally have to win on 60 percent or more of their trades, since the risk usually has to be about the size of the reward. Scalp\nsetups are much more common than swing setups, but most scalp setups do not have a 60 percent probability of success and should be avoided.\nHowever, reversals are common in the first hour, and traders often do not have enough time to adequately assess the trader's equation. If their\ndefault is to take every reversal and then do the math after they are in, they will lose over time. The high or low of the day often follows a setup that\nhas less than a 50 percent chance of success, and is therefore a terrible setup for a scalp, but it can still be a great setup for a swing.\nExperienced traders can usually find four or more scalps in the first hour and even make a living off those trades. For example, if they average\ntwo profitable scalps a day of two points each and trade 25 Emini contracts, they could make a million dollars a year. Since most traders cannot\nprocess the risk, reward, and probability reliably when they have to do it quickly and with only five or 10 bars of information, they should not scalp in\nthe first hour when reversals come quickly and abruptly. Instead, they should wait patiently for a setup that is likely to lead to an always-in swing, or\nwait until the swing has begun and the market has a clear always-in direction, and then take a swing trade. They will then have a reward that is\nlarger than their risk (it may be two or three times as large), and since the always-in direction is clear, they'll have a 60 percent or better chance of\nthe market going at least as many ticks in their direction as they have at risk from their stop, at which point they can move their stop to breakeven.\nMany experienced traders look for a strong trend bar or consecutive trend bars in the first hour, and then will scalp a pullback. For example, if\nthere are two consecutive strong bull trend bars and then a doji bar, they might place limit orders to buy at or below the low of the doji bar. Since\nthey see it as a weak reversal signal, especially after such a strong bull spike, they expect it to fail. This means that the bears who sold below the\nbar will have to buy back their shorts and probably won't want to sell again for at least a bar or two. This removes bears from the market and turns\nsome bears into buyers, which gives the bull scalpers a good chance to make a profit. The protective stop size and target size depend on how\nlarge the bars are. If the Emini has had an average daily range of about 15 points and the bull trend bars are about two points tall, traders might risk\nabout two points to make two points, if they believe that there is a 60 percent chance of success, which there often is in these circumstances. Other\nbulls might scale in lower and risk to below the bottom of the bull spike. Only very experienced traders should be fading breakouts of bars in the first\nhour, because the moves can be fast and go very far, and traders have to be very confident of their read and their ability to manage their trades in a\nfast, volatile market.\nThe moves in the first hour can be fast, and traders often get caught up in the excitement of big trend bars and enter late. They know that a trend\nwill soon begin and are fearful of missing it, and instead get caught in a reversal. Since the market is searching for direction in the first hour,\nreversals are common. Traders might take a trade and think that they will swing it, only to discover that it reverses on the next bar. They then have to\ndecide whether to exit or to rely on a stop beyond the signal bar. Invariably, as they are making that decision, they realize that the reversal trade is\nbetter than the trade they took, and they struggle with trying to figure out how to minimize their loss and get into a trade in the other direction. They\nhold too long, hoping for a pullback, and then exit with a larger loss than they planned on taking. Not only that; they are upset by the large loss and\nneed to recover before taking the next trade. Once they are ready to trade again, the market has moved so far in the new direction that they are\nafraid to take the trade, even though the trend looks strong. At the end of the day, they print the chart out and cannot believe how clear the setups\nactually were. But hindsight is very different from real time.\nTraders can also lose money on scalps that should be swings. If they lost several times earlier in the week on what they thought were good swing\ntrades, they will be wary of swing trading on the open today. Assume that several times this week the market went far enough for a scalper's profit,\nbut quickly reversed and stopped them out with a loss. Today, they decide to scalp every trade in the first hour. They lose on the first two scalps, but\nwhen they were stopped out on the second trade, the bar that hit the stop reversed into an outside bar and led to a very strong trend in the direction\nof the trade that they no longer held. Since they decided that they wanted to trade only scalps on reversals, they are on the sidelines as the market\ntrends relentlessly, bar after bar. The trend runs for eight points before there is a pullback, and they suddenly realize that this one swing trade\noffered as much profit as four successful scalps.\nAfter several days of losing when they tried to scalp because they took low-probability setups, and having given up on trying to swing because\nthey got stopped out so often (only to miss a big trend after they gave up), they are confused and upset. They feel like they did everything right but\nstill lost, and that trading is so unfair: “Why can other people do so well in the first hour, yet I lose no matter what I do?” It is because they are trying to\ndo too much. They are buying at the top and selling at the bottom of the developing range, hoping for a successful breakout, denying the reality that\nmost breakout attempts fail. They then do not take the best swing setup, because it looks weak and it looks like it will probably fail, just like the past\nfive reversals in the past hour. When traders feel this way, they should take a break from trading the opening range until the always-in position is\nclear. Yes, they will be entering after the trend has already gone a couple of points and they stand to make less, but the chance of success is much\ngreater. It is far better to win a little, but win frequently, than it is to lose several times a day while hoping to finally figure out how to trade the first hour\nprofitably.\nTraders who can scalp successfully often have to make adjustments in the first hour. In general, scalpers usually have to risk about as much as\ntheir reward, but since it is always best to begin by looking at what risk is required, they can set a reasonable reward after determining their risk.\nFor example, if the bars in the Emini are usually about two points tall, but they are about four points tall today, a trader might have to risk about four\npoints. The market is moving quickly and it is difficult to spend time doing exact math while trying to read the charts and to place orders. Scalpers\nshould just quickly cut the position size in half or by two-thirds. It doesn't matter what they do. What matters is that they do it quickly, stop thinking\nabout it, and concentrate on what is much more important: reading correctly and placing orders. If they are unwilling to use a larger stop when it is\nnecessary, they should not take the trade. Also, once traders are in the trade and the market pulls back further than they think it should have (but\ndoes not hit their stop), and then the move resumes but looks weaker than they think it should, they have to be willing to get out at a smaller profit\ntarget. For example, the large bars might force them to risk four points instead of two on an Emini trade, but once the move has gone their way, it\nlooks weak. If they believe that their premise is no longer valid, they have to be able to change their goal, and it is often worth exiting with just a point\nor two profit and then waiting for more information.\nOnly experienced traders, who can handle changing position, stop, and profit target sizes quickly, should attempt it. Because scalping usually\nrequires a risk that is as large as the reward, and therefore a high winning percentage, most traders should avoid scalps, especially in the first hour.\nMost traders have a better chance of being profitable in the long run if they can wait for a clearly always-in market and then take a swing trade. This\nmeans that the probability of an equidistant move is 60 percent or more. They can then use a profit target that is at least as large as the risk, and\npreferably twice the size of the risk, and have a favorable trader's equation.\nBecause the first hour has many reversals, it is better to look to buy low and sell high until the market becomes clearly always-in long or short.\nUnfortunately, many traders do the opposite. They see large trend bars up or down and are afraid that they are missing a breakout, which almost\nalways fails. They have to learn to wait for a confirmed breakout and a clear always-in market. Then they should switch to a swing approach and\n", "text_clean": "use a protective stop that is beyond the signal bar, which often requires a stop that is two or more times larger than their usual size.\nOne of the biggest causes of losses is a trader's inability to distinguish between swing and scalp setups. From the trader's equation, readers know that scalpers generally have to win on 60 percent or more of their trades, since the risk usually has to be about the size of the reward. Scalp setups are much more common than swing setups, but most scalp setups do not have a 60 percent probability of success and should be avoided.\nHowever, reversals are common in the first hour, and traders often do not have enough time to adequately assess the trader's equation. If their default is to take every reversal and then do the math after they are in, they will lose over time. The high or low of the day often follows a setup that has less than a 50 percent chance of success, and is therefore a terrible setup for a scalp, but it can still be a great setup for a swing.\nExperienced traders can usually find four or more scalps in the first hour and even make a living off those trades. For example, if they average two profitable scalps a day of two points each and trade 25 Emini contracts, they could make a million dollars a year. Since most traders cannot process the risk, reward, and probability reliably when they have to do it quickly and with only five or 10 bars of information, they should not scalp in the first hour when reversals come quickly and abruptly. Instead, they should wait patiently for a setup that is likely to lead to an always-in swing, or wait until the swing has begun and the market has a clear always-in direction, and then take a swing trade. They will then have a reward that is larger than their risk (it may be two or three times as large), and since the always-in direction is clear, they'll have a 60 percent or better chance of the market going at least as many ticks in their direction as they have at risk from their stop, at which point they can move their stop to breakeven.\nMany experienced traders look for a strong trend bar or consecutive trend bars in the first hour, and then will scalp a pullback. For example, if there are two consecutive strong bull trend bars and then a doji bar, they might place limit orders to buy at or below the low of the doji bar. Since they see it as a weak reversal signal, especially after such a strong bull spike, they expect it to fail. This means that the bears who sold below the bar will have to buy back their shorts and probably won't want to sell again for at least a bar or two. This removes bears from the market and turns some bears into buyers, which gives the bull scalpers a good chance to make a profit. The protective stop size and target size depend on how large the bars are. If the Emini has had an average daily range of about 15 points and the bull trend bars are about two points tall, traders might risk about two points to make two points, if they believe that there is a 60 percent chance of success, which there often is in these circumstances. Other bulls might scale in lower and risk to below the bottom of the bull spike. Only very experienced traders should be fading breakouts of bars in the first hour, because the moves can be fast and go very far, and traders have to be very confident of their read and their ability to manage their trades in a fast, volatile market.\nThe moves in the first hour can be fast, and traders often get caught up in the excitement of big trend bars and enter late. They know that a trend will soon begin and are fearful of missing it, and instead get caught in a reversal. Since the market is searching for direction in the first hour, reversals are common. Traders might take a trade and think that they will swing it, only to discover that it reverses on the next bar. They then have to decide whether to exit or to rely on a stop beyond the signal bar. Invariably, as they are making that decision, they realize that the reversal trade is better than the trade they took, and they struggle with trying to figure out how to minimize their loss and get into a trade in the other direction. They hold too long, hoping for a pullback, and then exit with a larger loss than they planned on taking. Not only that; they are upset by the large loss and need to recover before taking the next trade. Once they are ready to trade again, the market has moved so far in the new direction that they are afraid to take the trade, even though the trend looks strong. At the end of the day, they print the chart out and cannot believe how clear the setups actually were. But hindsight is very different from real time.\nTraders can also lose money on scalps that should be swings. If they lost several times earlier in the week on what they thought were good swing trades, they will be wary of swing trading on the open today. Assume that several times this week the market went far enough for a scalper's profit, but quickly reversed and stopped them out with a loss. Today, they decide to scalp every trade in the first hour. They lose on the first two scalps, but when they were stopped out on the second trade, the bar that hit the stop reversed into an outside bar and led to a very strong trend in the direction of the trade that they no longer held. Since they decided that they wanted to trade only scalps on reversals, they are on the sidelines as the market trends relentlessly, bar after bar. The trend runs for eight points before there is a pullback, and they suddenly realize that this one swing trade offered as much profit as four successful scalps.\nAfter several days of losing when they tried to scalp because they took low-probability setups, and having given up on trying to swing because they got stopped out so often (only to miss a big trend after they gave up), they are confused and upset. They feel like they did everything right but still lost, and that trading is so unfair: “Why can other people do so well in the first hour, yet I lose no matter what I do?” It is because they are trying to do too much. They are buying at the top and selling at the bottom of the developing range, hoping for a successful breakout, denying the reality that most breakout attempts fail. They then do not take the best swing setup, because it looks weak and it looks like it will probably fail, just like the past five reversals in the past hour. When traders feel this way, they should take a break from trading the opening range until the always-in position is clear. Yes, they will be entering after the trend has already gone a couple of points and they stand to make less, but the chance of success is much greater. It is far better to win a little, but win frequently, than it is to lose several times a day while hoping to finally figure out how to trade the first hour profitably.\nTraders who can scalp successfully often have to make adjustments in the first hour. In general, scalpers usually have to risk about as much as their reward, but since it is always best to begin by looking at what risk is required, they can set a reasonable reward after determining their risk.\nFor example, if the bars in the Emini are usually about two points tall, but they are about four points tall today, a trader might have to risk about four points. The market is moving quickly and it is difficult to spend time doing exact math while trying to read the charts and to place orders. Scalpers should just quickly cut the position size in half or by two-thirds. It doesn't matter what they do. What matters is that they do it quickly, stop thinking about it, and concentrate on what is much more important: reading correctly and placing orders. If they are unwilling to use a larger stop when it is necessary, they should not take the trade. Also, once traders are in the trade and the market pulls back further than they think it should have (but does not hit their stop), and then the move resumes but looks weaker than they think it should, they have to be willing to get out at a smaller profit target. For example, the large bars might force them to risk four points instead of two on an Emini trade, but once the move has gone their way, it looks weak. If they believe that their premise is no longer valid, they have to be able to change their goal, and it is often worth exiting with just a point or two profit and then waiting for more information.\nOnly experienced traders, who can handle changing position, stop, and profit target sizes quickly, should attempt it.

If traders cannot quickly\ndistinguish swing setups from scalp setups, they should not make rash decisions. Instead, they should wait patiently for a clear always-in signal and\nthen begin trading. Most traders cannot successfully scalp in the first hour, and certainly are unable to scalp initially and then switch to swing trading\nwhen the time is right. They should instead wait patiently for swing setups.\nSince the first hour or two frequently provides setups that result in great swing trades, traders must be ready to take them. Although there is a\ntendency to think that the patterns are different in the first hour, the reality is that from a price action perspective, they are not. The setups are the\nsame as during any other time of the day and on any time frame. What is different is that the volatility is often greater and therefore the patterns run\nfurther, and the reversals are often unexpectedly abrupt. It is common for reversals to look weak and have two or three weak doji bars before the\ntrend breaks out. Realize that this is common and, if you entered and see this weakness, don't scratch out. Rely on your read because you will likely\nbe right, and you stand to make a large swing profit.\nOne other difference about the open is that many trades set up based on yesterday's price action. There will often be a channel that develops in\nthe final couple of hours of yesterday followed by either a breakout or a market gap well beyond that flag on today's open. In either case, watch for\nreversals and continuations. Remember, a channel is just a flag, so a bull channel is a bear flag and a bear channel is a bull flag. Also, if the market\nended clearly always-in long or short, traders should assume that the trend will continue on the open until they see evidence to the contrary.\nA final important difference is that the high or low of the day occurs in the first hour or so on most days, and it is beneficial to try to swing part of\nany trade that might be the high or low of the day. If you are in a trade with such potential and the market moves strongly in your direction, use a\nbreakeven stop to allow yourself to collect the windfall profits that often happen off the open.\nAlthough any reversal in the first hour or so can create the high or low of the day, the probability of any one particular reversal doing so is usually\nnot more than 50 percent. If a trader instead waits for clear follow-through and a clear always-in move after the reversal, the probability that the\nreversal will be the high or low of the day is often more than 60 percent. The traders who wait for the always-in confirmation pay for that increased\nprobability with smaller profits, but traders who prefer to take only high-probability trades are happy with the trade-off. Since the high or low of the\nday setup is often only 40 to 50 percent certain, it is usually a bad scalp setup, even though it has a strong trader's equation for a swing trade. The\ntrend, as it begins, often starts slowly and does not look like a trend at all, but usually within five bars or so has a breakout into a clear always-in\nmarket. Most of the time, the setup for a bull trend day is part of a double bottom of some type, even though it is usually so imperfect that it does not\nlook like a double bottom. Likewise, the setup for a bear trend day is usually part of an imperfect double top. For example, if there is a series of\nstrong bull trend bars off the open and then a partial pullback that gets tested five to 10 bars later, this forms a double bottom flag entry and has a\ngood chance of leading to a new high of the day. The breakout then might run for a measured move up and lead to a bull trend.\nTraders often enter on the second bar of the day as it breaks beyond the high or low of the first bar, but the probability of a successful scalp is\noften under 50 percent, depending on the situation. That means that the trader's equation makes sense only for a swing, but traders often\nmistakenly treat the trade like a scalp, which is a losing approach when the probability is about 50 percent and the risk is as large as the reward.\nThey convince themselves that they will swing and hold through pullbacks, but within a bar or two, they grab a small profit and feel relieved. They\nreally intended to scalp but did not realize it, and they will wonder at the end of the month why they lost money. It is because they took a trade that\nhad a losing trader's equation. Some reversals in the first hour have a 70 percent chance of reaching a scalper's target, but only a 40 percent\nchance of reaching a swing target. Traders have to know in advance how they plan to manage the trade before they take it, because changing\ngoals after entering is a losing strategy. You can't have one premise and then manage the trade as if it was based on a different premise, but it is\ncommon for traders to confuse scalps and swings in the first hour when everything happens so quickly and the bars are large and have big\npullbacks within the bars as they are forming.\nThe first bar of the day has about a 20 percent chance of being either the high or low of the day (except on days where there is a large gap\nopening, when the probability can be 50 percent or more if the bar is a strong trend bar). Also, the bar is often large, frequently about 20 percent of\nan average day's ultimate range. For example, if the average range in the Emini has been about 10 points and the first bar of today is two points\ntall, a trader who buys as the second bar breaks above the first bar has about a 20 percent chance of making eight points while risking a little more\nthan two points. This is a losing trader's equation. If traders are very good at subjectively evaluating all of the variables and selecting trades with a\nhigher probability, they can have a mathematical edge, but these high-probability trades based on the first bar of the day happen only about once a\nmonth. Even if traders take profits once the reward is twice the size of the risk, they will be successful only a couple of times a month, so looking for\na swing entry on the second bar of the day is rarely worthwhile. However, since a reliable swing in the first hour, where the reward is twice the size\nof the risk, occurs on most days, if there is a strong reversal setup early on, traders should consider swinging the trade. Once the trend reaches\nabout twice the size of their stop, they can move their stop to breakeven and swing part of the trade until there is an always-in reversal.\nSometimes the market trends for the first bar or two of the day and that first bar ends up as one of the extremes of the day. When the market\ntrends from the open, it is important to enter early, but not necessarily on the second bar. This pattern is most common with gap openings, large or\nsmall. When you enter a trade where you might be at the start of a huge trend, it is particularly important to try to swing some contracts. If the pattern\nis very strong, you could swing most of your contracts and then quickly move your stop to breakeven.\nHowever, if the strong opening is reversed (a breakout to a new extreme of the day in the opposite direction), then the day might trend in the\nopposite direction or it could turn into a trading range day. A strong trend off the open, even if it is reversed, still means that there were traders\nwilling to trade aggressively in that direction, and they will be quick to trade again in that direction later in the day if the reversal falters.\nIf you think that a reversal down is not the high of the day, you should never be more than 30 percent certain, because you would then be at least\n70 percent certain that it is not, and the market is never that certain when the opening range is forming. In fact, rarely is anything that certain at any\ntime of the day. That edge is simply too large, and traders would quickly neutralize it long before it got that certain. Don't get too committed to an\nopinion, especially in the first hour, because even the strongest moves can reverse sharply on the next bar. However, although a reversal in the first\ncouple of hours might have only a 30 to 40 percent chance of becoming the high or low of the day, if there is good follow-through, the odds can\nquickly increase to 50 to 60 percent.\nEven though most early reversals are good for scalps and not swings, when one is particularly strong, a trader should try to swing at least half of\nthe position. As mentioned earlier, there is a tendency for the first hour or two to be the most likely time of the day to find a trade where a trader can\nmake two to three times the risk. In general, most traders should work very hard to take potential swing trades in the first hour or two because those\ntrades have the best trader's equation combination of reward, risk, and probability.\nWhy does the market make a big move over the first several bars and then reverse? Why doesn't it simply open at the low or high of the day? The\nlocation of the open of the day is not set by any firm or group of firms; instead, it represents a brief equilibrium between buyers and sellers at the\ninstant of the open, and it is usually determined by the premarket activity. For example, the Emini is basically a 24-hour market and trades actively,\nuninterrupted, for hours leading up to the open of the New York Stock Exchange.

If you were an institutional\ntrader and had a lot of buy orders to fill today, you would love the market to open above where you wanted to buy and then have a sharp move down\ninto your buy zone where you could aggressively buy along with all the other institutions that likely also have lots of similar buy orders from their\nclients; you would then hope to see a small sell climax that will form a convincing low of the day. The lack of buying by the bullish institutions creates\na sell vacuum that can quickly suck the market down into their buy zone, which is always at an area of support, where they will buy aggressively and\nrelentlessly, often creating the low of the day.\nIf the reversal back up from that sell climax on the open is strong enough, very few traders will be looking to short, because there will be a general\nfeeling that the upward momentum is sufficiently strong to warrant at least a second leg up before the low is tested, if it gets tested. Would there be\nanything that you, if you were an institutional trader, could do to make this happen? Yes! You could buy into the close of the premarket to push the\nprice up and fill some of your orders. Not as much volume is needed in stocks to move the price before the 6:30 a.m. PST open. Then, once the\nmarket opens, you could liquidate some or all of your longs and even do some shorting. Since you want to buy lower, you will not start buying until\nthe market falls to an area that you consider represents value, which will be at a support area. This is a vacuum effect. The buyers are there, but\nthey will step aside if they think that the price will be lower in a few minutes. Why buy now if you can buy for less in a few minutes? This absence of\nbuying despite the existence of very strong bulls allows the price to get sucked down quickly. Once it is in their buy zone, they see value and doubt\nthe market will fall further. They appear as if out of nowhere and buy relentlessly, causing a very sharp bull reversal. The shorts will also see the\nsupport, and if they believe that the leg down is likely over, they, too, will become buyers as they take profits on their shorts.\nPrice action is very important. A trader wants to see how the market responds once it gets down to some key support price, like the moving\naverage, or a prior swing high or low, or the low of yesterday, or a trend line or trend channel line. Most of the trading is done by computers, which\nuse algorithms to calculate where these support levels are. If enough firms are relying on the same support levels, the buying will overwhelm the\nselling and the market will reverse up. It is impossible to know in advance how strong the buying will be, but since the support is always based on\nmathematics, an experienced trader can usually anticipate areas where reversals might occur and be ready to place trades. If the downward\nmomentum begins to wane and the market starts to reverse up from the key price, institutions will liquidate any shorts and aggressively buy to fill\ntheir orders. Since most firms will have similar orders, the market will start to rally. If a firm believes that the low of the day might be in, it will continue\nto buy as the market rallies and will aggressively buy any pullbacks. Since its order size is huge, it doesn't want to buy all at once and risk causing a\nspike up and then a buy climax. Instead, it would rather just keep buying in an orderly fashion all day long until all of its orders get filled. As they get\nfilled, the relentless buying causes the market to go up more, which attracts momentum traders who will also buy throughout the day, adding to the\nbuying pressure.\nIs this what actually happens? Traders at institutions know if this is what they do, but no one ever knows for certain why the market reverses on\nany given day. The reversal is due to countless reasons, but those reasons are irrelevant. All that matters is price action. Reversals often happen\nseconds after a report is released, but an individual trader is unlikely to understand how the market will respond to a report by simply watching\nCNBC. The market can rally or sell off in response to either a bullish or a bearish report, and a trader is simply not qualified to reliably interpret a\nreport in the absence of price action. The best way to know how the market will respond is simply to watch it respond and place your trades as the\nprice action unfolds. Very often, the bar before the report is a great setup that gets triggered on the report. If you feel compelled to trade on the\nrelease of the report, place your order and then your stop and trust your read. Since slippage can be significant on a report, it is almost always\nbetter to wait until after the report is released. If you enter on the report, you might find that you got a few ticks of slippage on the entry, and then the\nmarket violently reverses and you get additional slippage on your exit. What you thought was a trade with a risk of eight ticks ends up as a trade\nwhere you lost 16 or more ticks. If you trade thinner markets, your slippage could be much worse and you could be so far down in the first hour that\nyou will not get back to breakeven by the close.\nWhen the market rallies sharply on a 7:00 a.m. PST report, it is usually because the institutions were already planning on buying, but were hoping\nto buy lower. When the report appeared sufficiently bullish for them to believe that they would not be able to fill their orders lower, they bought on the\nreport. If they have enough buying to do, they will continue to buy all day, and the day will become a bull trend day. If, on the other hand, their initial\nbuying is overwhelmed by other institutions who were hoping for a rally that would allow them to short at a higher price, the upside breakout will fail\nand the market will trend down. These bears were invisible because they were waiting for a rally to short and their power became evident only once\nthey began to aggressively short the rally and turn the market back down.

Too often the moves are very large in the first second or two, only to reverse a few seconds later, and then maybe reverse again. Traders\nsimply cannot make decisions and place orders fast enough to trade this situation profitably. It is better to wait to see if a clear always-in move\ncomes from the report and then trade in that direction. When your opponents have an edge over you—in this case, speed—it is better to wait for\ntheir edge to disappear before trading again. Most traders should not trade in the seconds after a report but should wait for the price action to\nreturn to normal, which often takes one to about 10 minutes.\nNo one knows in advance whether the sum total of all the buy orders at all of the major institutions would be enough to overwhelm the institutions\nthat were looking to short, or whether the shorts represented vastly more dollars and would be able to drive the market down. On most days, the\naction is two-sided for a while as the bulls continue to buy and the bears continue to sell. The market probes up and down in buy and sell vacuums,\nlooking for one side to take control over the market when the market reaches an extreme. When it is low enough, strong bulls, who have been\nwaiting for the market to reach a level that they see as value, will buy aggressively. The market then races up to an area where the bulls no longer\nfeel that the price represents good value, and they stop buying and begin to take profits. The strong bears, who have been waiting for higher prices\nto sell, appear out of nowhere and short aggressively. At some point, one side decides that they are unwilling to continue trading aggressively at the\ncurrent price, and this creates an imbalance that allows the other side to begin to move the market in their direction. The losing side begins to\ncover, and this adds to the trend. The winning side sees the market moving their way and they add to their positions, creating a stronger trend. At\nsome point, they will begin to take profits and this will result in a pullback. Once the market comes back far enough to represent value to these\nfirms, they will once again begin to add to their positions and the result will usually be a test of the trend's extreme.\nSharp reversals are common on economic reports, and the reversals may not make sense to you, but that is irrelevant. How can a bullish report\nlead to a rally and then seconds later be followed by a new low of the day? If the market was so bearish a couple of minutes ago, how can it be so\nbullish now? Don't give it any thought. Instead, just look for standard price action setups and trade them mindlessly without giving any consideration\nto the reasons why the reversal is taking place. All that you need to know is that it is in fact taking place and you must enter. You don't need to\nunderstand it, but it is important to realize that it can happen quickly and you might not react fast enough to avoid losing money.\nAlthough the 5 minute chart is the easiest to read and the most reliable, the 3 minute chart trades well, particularly in the first hour. However, it is\nprone to more losers, and if you like the highest winning percentage and don't want the negative emotion that comes from losing, you should stick to\ntrading the 5 minute chart and work on increasing your position size.\nAs a trader, it is best to keep your analysis simple, especially in the first hour when the market is moving quickly. The vast majority of opens are\nrelated to the price action of the final hour or so of the prior day and take the form of a breakout, a failed breakout, a breakout pullback, or a trend\nfrom the open, and any of these can move very fast.\nOne of the most difficult aspects of day trading is maintaining focus. Most traders simply cannot stay intensely connected to the market for the\nentire session, and they succumb to boredom and distractions and often suspect that this is a major obstacle to them becoming consistently\nprofitable. And they are right. The first hour provides you with a great opportunity to remedy this problem. Even if you think that watching every tick\nor at least every 5 minute bar is impossible for you for an entire day, you might believe that you can do it for an hour. This has to become one of\nyour primary goals because it is a great way to make money. The volume is huge and there are several trades every day in that first hour. If you\nsimply trade the first hour and increase your position size once you become consistently profitable, you might discover that the intensity is needed\nfor only that hour. Then, for the rest of the day, just look for two or three major reversals, which you can almost always anticipate 10 or more minutes\nin advance, especially if you are waiting for second entries (once you see the first one, get ready to take the second, which will usually follow within\na few bars). Once you can trade the first hour well, look to trade the first two hours, which usually provide the best trading of the day and can very\noften give you all of the profit that you expect from the entire day.\nWhen trading around holidays like Christmas week and the week of the Fourth of July, the first hour is often very important because often that is\nthe only time when the market behaves like a normal day. It then frequently enters a tight trading range for the rest of the day. If you want to trade\naround holidays, you have to be particularly alert to setups in the first hour.\nWhen trading the 5 minute chart, it is easy to not be thinking about the many institutional traders who are also paying attention to 15 minute\ncharts. The first 15 minute bar closes at the close of the third 5 minute bar and therefore activity around this third bar will influence the appearance\nof the first 15 minute bar. For example, if the first two bars of the day move in one direction and then the third bar is a smaller pause bar, the\nbreakout of the bar will determine whether there is a 15 minute breakout or there could be a failure. Therefore, trading the breakout of the third bar\nof the day often leads to a big move. Do not place a trade on the third bar alone on most days, but be aware of its extra significance. If it is an\nimportant bar, there will usually be other price action to support the trade, and that additional information should be the basis for the trade.\nSimilar logic can also be used for the last 5 minute bar of the 30 and 60 minute charts (for example, the 60 minute chart is made of 12 bars on\nthe 5 minute chart, so the final one closes when the 60 minute bar closes), but focusing on such longer time frames and their infrequent entries\nincreases the chances of missing one or more profitable 5 minute trades and therefore is not worthwhile.\nBarbwire represents two-sided trading, and when it develops in the first hour, it often will be followed by a day where bulls and bears alternate\ncontrol of the market. If there is a trend after the barbwire, there will usually be a tradable countertrend setup at some point.\nThe first bar of the day often shows what the day will be like. If it is a doji in the middle of a tight trading range from the final hour of yesterday and\nthe moving average is flat, the odds favor a trading range day. If the bar is a trend bar but has prominent tails, it is a one-bar trading range. Since\nmost trading range breakouts fail, the market will probably not be able to move above or below the bar for more than a bar or two before there is a\nreversal. Some traders fade the breakouts of the first bar if it has prominent tails, and they will scale in once or twice. For example, whether the\nmarket gaps up or down or has a bull or bear body, if the tails are fairly prominent, many traders will short above the bar and buy below the bar for a\nscalp, since they know that reversals usually dominate the first hour and that the breakout of a trading range, even if the trading range is a single\nbar, is likely to fail. Therefore, they bet that it will fail and trade in the opposite direction. Since they see that bar as a one-bar trading range, they are\nin trading range mode, which means that they will usually scalp most or all of their position.\nThe next several bars can also show the bias of the day. If dojis continue and there are five reversals in the first hour, the odds of a trading range\nday go up. If there is a large gap opening and the market trends for the first four bars, the odds of a trend day are good. Traders will be ready for a\ntrend from the first bar trend, and those first bars might be the spike of a spike and channel trend day. However, they will be ready if the first\npullback becomes a small final flag. This can lead to a spike in the opposite direction, a breakout of the opposite end of the opening range, and\nthen a trend in the opposite direction.\nThe strongest swing trades in the first couple of hours come from a confluence of patterns, but the patterns are sometimes subtle and traders\nshould look for them before the open and think about what might happen. Always consider both the bull and bear case for everything, because there\nis smart money on both sides. As always, traders are looking for breakouts and failed breakouts. For example, was there an 18-bar long bear flag\nat the end of yesterday that pulled back to the bear trend line, and if so, did today open just below the bear flag and below the moving average,\n", "text_clean": "place. Too often the moves are very large in the first second or two, only to reverse a few seconds later, and then maybe reverse again. Traders simply cannot make decisions and place orders fast enough to trade this situation profitably. It is better to wait to see if a clear always-in move comes from the report and then trade in that direction. When your opponents have an edge over you—in this case, speed—it is better to wait for their edge to disappear before trading again. Most traders should not trade in the seconds after a report but should wait for the price action to return to normal, which often takes one to about 10 minutes.\nNo one knows in advance whether the sum total of all the buy orders at all of the major institutions would be enough to overwhelm the institutions that were looking to short, or whether the shorts represented vastly more dollars and would be able to drive the market down. On most days, the action is two-sided for a while as the bulls continue to buy and the bears continue to sell. The market probes up and down in buy and sell vacuums, looking for one side to take control over the market when the market reaches an extreme. When it is low enough, strong bulls, who have been waiting for the market to reach a level that they see as value, will buy aggressively. The market then races up to an area where the bulls no longer feel that the price represents good value, and they stop buying and begin to take profits. The strong bears, who have been waiting for higher prices to sell, appear out of nowhere and short aggressively. At some point, one side decides that they are unwilling to continue trading aggressively at the current price, and this creates an imbalance that allows the other side to begin to move the market in their direction. The losing side begins to cover, and this adds to the trend. The winning side sees the market moving their way and they add to their positions, creating a stronger trend. At some point, they will begin to take profits and this will result in a pullback. Once the market comes back far enough to represent value to these firms, they will once again begin to add to their positions and the result will usually be a test of the trend's extreme.\nSharp reversals are common on economic reports, and the reversals may not make sense to you, but that is irrelevant. How can a bullish report lead to a rally and then seconds later be followed by a new low of the day? If the market was so bearish a couple of minutes ago, how can it be so bullish now? Don't give it any thought. Instead, just look for standard price action setups and trade them mindlessly without giving any consideration to the reasons why the reversal is taking place. All that you need to know is that it is in fact taking place and you must enter. You don't need to understand it, but it is important to realize that it can happen quickly and you might not react fast enough to avoid losing money.\nAlthough the 5 minute chart is the easiest to read and the most reliable, the 3 minute chart trades well, particularly in the first hour. However, it is prone to more losers, and if you like the highest winning percentage and don't want the negative emotion that comes from losing, you should stick to trading the 5 minute chart and work on increasing your position size.\nAs a trader, it is best to keep your analysis simple, especially in the first hour when the market is moving quickly. The vast majority of opens are related to the price action of the final hour or so of the prior day and take the form of a breakout, a failed breakout, a breakout pullback, or a trend from the open, and any of these can move very fast.\nOne of the most difficult aspects of day trading is maintaining focus. Most traders simply cannot stay intensely connected to the market for the entire session, and they succumb to boredom and distractions and often suspect that this is a major obstacle to them becoming consistently profitable. And they are right. The first hour provides you with a great opportunity to remedy this problem. Even if you think that watching every tick or at least every 5 minute bar is impossible for you for an entire day, you might believe that you can do it for an hour. This has to become one of your primary goals because it is a great way to make money. The volume is huge and there are several trades every day in that first hour. If you simply trade the first hour and increase your position size once you become consistently profitable, you might discover that the intensity is needed for only that hour. Then, for the rest of the day, just look for two or three major reversals, which you can almost always anticipate 10 or more minutes in advance, especially if you are waiting for second entries (once you see the first one, get ready to take the second, which will usually follow within a few bars). Once you can trade the first hour well, look to trade the first two hours, which usually provide the best trading of the day and can very often give you all of the profit that you expect from the entire day.\nWhen trading around holidays like Christmas week and the week of the Fourth of July, the first hour is often very important because often that is the only time when the market behaves like a normal day. It then frequently enters a tight trading range for the rest of the day. If you want to trade around holidays, you have to be particularly alert to setups in the first hour.\nWhen trading the 5 minute chart, it is easy to not be thinking about the many institutional traders who are also paying attention to 15 minute charts. The first 15 minute bar closes at the close of the third 5 minute bar and therefore activity around this third bar will influence the appearance of the first 15 minute bar. For example, if the first two bars of the day move in one direction and then the third bar is a smaller pause bar, the breakout of the bar will determine whether there is a 15 minute breakout or there could be a failure. Therefore, trading the breakout of the third bar of the day often leads to a big move. Do not place a trade on the third bar alone on most days, but be aware of its extra significance. If it is an important bar, there will usually be other price action to support the trade, and that additional information should be the basis for the trade.\nSimilar logic can also be used for the last 5 minute bar of the 30 and 60 minute charts (for example, the 60 minute chart is made of 12 bars on the 5 minute chart, so the final one closes when the 60 minute bar closes), but focusing on such longer time frames and their infrequent entries increases the chances of missing one or more profitable 5 minute trades and therefore is not worthwhile.\nBarbwire represents two-sided trading, and when it develops in the first hour, it often will be followed by a day where bulls and bears alternate control of the market. If there is a trend after the barbwire, there will usually be a tradable countertrend setup at some point.\nThe first bar of the day often shows what the day will be like. If it is a doji in the middle of a tight trading range from the final hour of yesterday and the moving average is flat, the odds favor a trading range day. If the bar is a trend bar but has prominent tails, it is a one-bar trading range. Since most trading range breakouts fail, the market will probably not be able to move above or below the bar for more than a bar or two before there is a reversal. Some traders fade the breakouts of the first bar if it has prominent tails, and they will scale in once or twice. For example, whether the market gaps up or down or has a bull or bear body, if the tails are fairly prominent, many traders will short above the bar and buy below the bar for a scalp, since they know that reversals usually dominate the first hour and that the breakout of a trading range, even if the trading range is a single bar, is likely to fail. Therefore, they bet that it will fail and trade in the opposite direction. Since they see that bar as a one-bar trading range, they are in trading range mode, which means that they will usually scalp most or all of their position.\nThe next several bars can also show the bias of the day. If dojis continue and there are five reversals in the first hour, the odds of a trading range day go up. If there is a large gap opening and the market trends for the first four bars, the odds of a trend day are good. Traders will be ready for a trend from the first bar trend, and those first bars might be the spike of a spike and channel trend day. However, they will be ready if the first pullback becomes a small final flag. This can lead to a spike in the opposite direction, a breakout of the opposite end of the opening range, and then a trend in the opposite direction.\nThe strongest swing trades in the first couple of hours come from a confluence of patterns, but the patterns are sometimes subtle and traders should look for them before the open and think about what might happen.

The rally from the open to the bar before\nbar 4 had several large bull bars and only two small bear bars, showing that the bulls were willing to be aggressive. This was something to\nremember later in the day in case another buy setup appeared. Keeping that in mind, traders should have been more willing to swing part of their\nlongs because the trend was more likely to resume.\nThe high of the day usually comes from some kind of double top that rarely looks like a double top. Here, bar 6 was the end of a second test up\nand therefore was the signal for a double top short. Bar 4 became the possible high of the day. Bar 8 was a double bottom with the closing low of\nyesterday, and it formed the low of today. Even though the probability of a successful swing on an opening reversal might be only 40 percent, many\nof the trades result in a small profit or a small loss. These small trades usually balance out, and the 40 percent that reach four or more points\nbecome the source of a trader's profit. Trading these opening moves should be a cornerstone for most traders as they try to build a business in day\ntrading.\nExperienced scalpers expect most breakout attempts to fail, and look to buy low and sell high in the first hour or two. Possible scalps included:\nselling above the first bar, which was a doji bar, and scaling in higher (exiting the first entry at breakeven and the second and third entries with a\nprofit); buying above the bar 1 bull trend bar; shorting below the bear inside bar that followed bar 2 (a failed breakout above the trading range of\nyesterday); buying on bar 3 as it broke above the high of the prior bar (since the spike up to bar 2 was strong and was likely to be followed by a\nsecond leg up); shorting below the two-bar reversal that followed the bar 3 breakout to a new high of the day (a low 2 short); and shorting below the\nbar 6 bull trend bar, since it was a two-legged breakout of the bear micro channel down to bar 5 and the bottom of the strong bear micro channel\ndown to bar 5 was likely to be tested.\nBar 8 was a successful second attempt to reverse the breakout to a new low of the day and a double bottom with the close of yesterday, so it\nwas likely to lead to a rally that had at least two legs. In fact, the two-legged rally only had a small sideways pause and therefore the move up was\nmostly in a channel. When a rally is mostly in a channel, even if there is a pause and a small second leg, most traders will see the entire channel as\nthe first leg and expect a more obvious second leg to follow. The move up to bar 11 was just an extension of that channel with no significant\npullback, and therefore many traders would have considered the rally from bar 8 to bar 11 to be just one leg. However, as with most channels, there\nwere many overlapping bars, prominent tails, and bear trend bars. A bull channel is a bear flag, so traders were looking for a downside breakout,\nwhich could have led to a pullback that was large enough to make traders believe that the first leg up was clearly over. They then needed to decide\nwhether a second leg up was still likely or the correction had lasted long enough for the bears to feel that the market would not go much higher,\nthereby convincing them that this was a good price level to again aggressively short. Instead of breaking to the downside, the market broke strongly\nto the upside and the bears who had been shorting for the past couple of hours had to quickly buy back their shorts. The bulls saw how strong the\nbull spike was, and they bought at the market all of the way up because when a spike is this strong, the odds favor higher prices.\nBar 12 was a high 2 buy for a second larger leg up, which also had two smaller legs.\nFIGURE PIII.3 Don't Scalp Stocks with Small Ranges\nTraders should not often scalp stocks with average daily ranges under a dollar, but price action entries still work. As shown in Figure PIII.3, Intel\n(INTC) had two large bear trend bars in the first 15 minutes and then formed a double top bear flag (bars 3 and 5). This is a reliable pattern that\noften leads to a bear trend day, and here it led to a spike and climax bear trend. Yesterday's bull trend was so strong that today's two-legged selling\nreversed back up at bar 6, likely at the moving average on the 15 or 60 minute charts, but it was good for at least a 10 cent scalp.\nWhenever the moving average is as steeply up as it was yesterday, any strong sell-off below it will almost always be followed by a tradable rally\nback up. Bar 6 was the signal for a double bottom bull flag with yesterday's 11:35 pullback from a strong spike up. It then formed an even stronger\nbull spike into the close and the entire move up became a spike and climax bull trend. Since the second spike is comparable to the channel in a\ntraditional spike and channel bull trend, its bottom usually gets tested, as it did here.\nFIGURE PIII.4 Early Barbwire Often Leads to a Trading Range Day\n", "text_clean": "As shown in Figure PIII.2, the price action in the first several bars often foreshadows what happens later.

The move up to bar 11 was just an extension of that channel with no significant pullback, and therefore many traders would have considered the rally from bar 8 to bar 11 to be just one leg. However, as with most channels, there were many overlapping bars, prominent tails, and bear trend bars. A bull channel is a bear flag, so traders were looking for a downside breakout, which could have led to a pullback that was large enough to make traders believe that the first leg up was clearly over. They then needed to decide whether a second leg up was still likely or the correction had lasted long enough for the bears to feel that the market would not go much higher, thereby convincing them that this was a good price level to again aggressively short. Instead of breaking to the downside, the market broke strongly to the upside and the bears who had been shorting for the past couple of hours had to quickly buy back their shorts. The bulls saw how strong the bull spike was, and they bought at the market all of the way up because when a spike is this strong, the odds favor higher prices.\nBar 12 was a high 2 buy for a second larger leg up, which also had two smaller legs.\nFIGURE PIII.3 Don't Scalp Stocks with Small Ranges Traders should not often scalp stocks with average daily ranges under a dollar, but price action entries still work. As shown in Figure PIII.3, Intel (INTC) had two large bear trend bars in the first 15 minutes and then formed a double top bear flag (bars 3 and 5). This is a reliable pattern that often leads to a bear trend day, and here it led to a spike and climax bear trend. Yesterday's bull trend was so strong that today's two-legged selling reversed back up at bar 6, likely at the moving average on the 15 or 60 minute charts, but it was good for at least a 10 cent scalp.\nWhenever the moving average is as steeply up as it was yesterday, any strong sell-off below it will almost always be followed by a tradable rally back up. Bar 6 was the signal for a double bottom bull flag with yesterday's 11:35 pullback from a strong spike up. It then formed an even stronger bull spike into the close and the entire move up became a spike and climax bull trend. Since the second spike is comparable to the channel in a traditional spike and channel bull trend, its bottom usually gets tested, as it did here.\nFIGURE PIII.4 Early Barbwire Often Leads to a Trading Range Day", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["As shown in Figure PIII.2, the price action in the first several bars often foreshadows what happens later.

Look at the final hour or\ntwo of yesterday to see if there was a strong trend (an always-in direction that might carry over to today), a trading range, a channel, or any kind of\npattern that could lead to a breakout on today's open. Although some days open within a quiet trading range from the final hour or two of the prior\nday and the moving average is flat, on most days there is some kind of breakout on the open. When you are uncertain what the breakout is, simply\nlook at the moving average and use that as a proxy. If the first bar is entirely above the moving average, think of the open as a gap up. If the first bar\nis entirely below the moving average, assume that the market is gapping down. There is usually a gap between the close of the final bar of\nyesterday and the open of the first bar of today, and that alone is a breakout. Look for breakouts of anything, including a channel or flag into\nyesterday's close. It can be a one-bar final flag or a three-hour channel. Look for a breakout below any swing high or low, especially the high or low\nof yesterday.\nOnce today opens and you see a breakout, you have to evaluate how likely it is to have follow-through. If there is a large gap down and the first\nbar is a strong bear trend bar with an open near its high and a close near its low, today might be a trend from the open bear. If instead it is a strong\nbull reversal bar, the breakout might fail and the day might become a trend from the open bull. If that bear breakout has follow-through for a few bars\nand then there is a strong bull reversal, this could set up a failed breakout and a possible low of the day. If the rally lasts only a bar or two and then\nthere is another strong bear trend bar, the failed breakout might be failing. If so, shorting below that bear bar is a breakout pullback entry. The\nmarket broke out and then it failed, but the failure turned into a pullback in the bear trend instead of a reversal.\nThe opposite is true when there is a bull breakout on the open. Look for follow-through or a reversal into a failed breakout short entry. Does the\nreversal down continue with two or three or more large bear trend bars, making a bear trend day likely? Or is there a bull reversal bar within a bar or\ntwo, resulting in a failure of that failed breakout? If so, the pattern is evolving into a breakout pullback buy setup. You need to evaluate every open\nthis way. Look for the breakout, and then look for a possible reversal into a failed breakout setup. Finally, if there is a failed breakout, look to see if\nit has follow-through or if it is failing. If it is failing, it is setting up a breakout pullback trade and a resumption of the breakout.\nFIGURE 18.1 A Bull Channel Is a Bear Flag\nA bull channel from yesterday is a bear flag, and the market often breaks below it on the open (see Figure 18.1). Yesterday, the Oil Service\nHOLDRS (OIH) 5 minute chart had a nearly four-hour, two-legged rally that broke the major bear trend line (not shown) after the strong move down\nto bar 1, and the rally overshot a bear trend channel line twice and reversed down both times (bars 4 and 5). This was evidence that the bulls were\nlosing control. The length of the rally was evidence of bullish strength.\nThe sell-off from bar 5 into the close flipped the market to always-in short, and traders assumed that this trend would carry into today's open.\nToday, the market gapped down, had a strong bear trend bar, and quickly traded below yesterday's low, where it formed a strong two-bar bull\nreversal. This large bear flag failed breakout occurred over two days and provided an excellent long entry at one tick above the high of bar 7. This\nwas a final flag reversal from the bear flag that began at bar 1, and a lower low major trend reversal. Opening reversals that reverse the high or low\nof the prior day often form the high or low of the day, so traders should swing some or most of their contracts. Here, a breakeven stop would have\nallowed a trader to make as much as $5.00 on a swing to a new swing high above bar 5.\nWhen the open forms a breakout of a pattern from the prior day's close, traders should enter on a failed breakout setup, like bar 7, and then enter\nin the opposite direction if the failed breakout fails and becomes a breakout pullback. Here, the three-bar rally that followed was strong enough so\nthat a second leg up was likely and therefore traders should not yet have been looking to short a breakout pullback. Since a second leg up was\nlikely, it was better to buy above bar 8 or below the low of either of the prior two bars. Bar 8 was a signal bar for a breakout pullback long, following\nthe breakout above the bar 6 top of the opening range. It was also a setup for a long based on the failed double top bear flag where bar 6 was the\nfirst top.\n", "text_clean": "CHAPTER 18\nPatterns Related to Yesterday: Breakouts, Breakout Pullbacks, and Failed Breakouts Many trades in the first hour are related to patterns from the prior day, so try to anticipate setups before the market opens.

If there is a large gap down and the first bar is a strong bear trend bar with an open near its high and a close near its low, today might be a trend from the open bear. If instead it is a strong bull reversal bar, the breakout might fail and the day might become a trend from the open bull. If that bear breakout has follow-through for a few bars and then there is a strong bull reversal, this could set up a failed breakout and a possible low of the day. If the rally lasts only a bar or two and then there is another strong bear trend bar, the failed breakout might be failing. If so, shorting below that bear bar is a breakout pullback entry. The market broke out and then it failed, but the failure turned into a pullback in the bear trend instead of a reversal.\nThe opposite is true when there is a bull breakout on the open. Look for follow-through or a reversal into a failed breakout short entry. Does the reversal down continue with two or three or more large bear trend bars, making a bear trend day likely? Or is there a bull reversal bar within a bar or two, resulting in a failure of that failed breakout? If so, the pattern is evolving into a breakout pullback buy setup. You need to evaluate every open this way. Look for the breakout, and then look for a possible reversal into a failed breakout setup. Finally, if there is a failed breakout, look to see if it has follow-through or if it is failing. If it is failing, it is setting up a breakout pullback trade and a resumption of the breakout.\nFIGURE 18.1 A Bull Channel Is a Bear Flag A bull channel from yesterday is a bear flag, and the market often breaks below it on the open (see Figure 18.1). Yesterday, the Oil Service HOLDRS (OIH) 5 minute chart had a nearly four-hour, two-legged rally that broke the major bear trend line (not shown) after the strong move down to bar 1, and the rally overshot a bear trend channel line twice and reversed down both times (bars 4 and 5). This was evidence that the bulls were losing control. The length of the rally was evidence of bullish strength.\nThe sell-off from bar 5 into the close flipped the market to always-in short, and traders assumed that this trend would carry into today's open.\nToday, the market gapped down, had a strong bear trend bar, and quickly traded below yesterday's low, where it formed a strong two-bar bull reversal. This large bear flag failed breakout occurred over two days and provided an excellent long entry at one tick above the high of bar 7. This was a final flag reversal from the bear flag that began at bar 1, and a lower low major trend reversal. Opening reversals that reverse the high or low of the prior day often form the high or low of the day, so traders should swing some or most of their contracts. Here, a breakeven stop would have allowed a trader to make as much as $5.00 on a swing to a new swing high above bar 5.\nWhen the open forms a breakout of a pattern from the prior day's close, traders should enter on a failed breakout setup, like bar 7, and then enter in the opposite direction if the failed breakout fails and becomes a breakout pullback. Here, the three-bar rally that followed was strong enough so that a second leg up was likely and therefore traders should not yet have been looking to short a breakout pullback. Since a second leg up was likely, it was better to buy above bar 8 or below the low of either of the prior two bars. Bar 8 was a signal bar for a breakout pullback long, following the breakout above the bar 6 top of the opening range.

The bull channel was made of a spike and channel bull trend, and the sell-off to bar 4 set up a possible double bottom bull flag.\nThe sell-off down to bar 4 broke below the bull channel, and today's open broke out of the top of the channel. Although the first bar of the day was a\nstrong bull reversal bar and could have been the beginning of a trend from the open bull, it was followed by a strong bear trend bar and created a\ntwo-bar reversal and a setup for a failed breakout short and a higher high major trend reversal. The result was a failed breakout above the bar 3\nwedge top and expanding triangle top (bars 2 and 3 were the first two pushes), and a trend from the open bear.\nYesterday's spike and channel bull trend ended in a wedge channel and was therefore likely to have at least a two-legged correction, but the\npullback from the breakout to bar 4 was a higher high up to bar 5. When there is a strong reversal setup like a second entry for a wedge or an\nexpanding triangle, the market usually corrects for at least 10 bars and two legs, which happened here. The market fell for an approximate\nmeasured move and tested just above yesterday's low. The two bull bodies at the low were a sign of buying pressure, and some bulls entered on a\nstop as bar 8 went above those bull bars. Other traders entered above the bar 8 outside up bar. The market was trying to form a double bottom with\nyesterday's low, and if it broke above the bar 5 high, it could work higher over the next couple of days to a measured move up.\nBar 9 was an outside up breakout bar, and it flipped the market to always-in long. It made traders think that the market was not in the process of\nforming a bear flag and was more likely trying to form the low of the day.\nThe rally to bar 10 was a three-bar bull spike with small tails and large bull bodies and therefore a second leg up was likely. The pullback was\nlikely to stay above the bar 9 low, which is where most traders became convinced that the market had flipped into bull mode.\nThe move up to bar 3 was very strong, with many bull trend bars, and even though it ended with a wedge, this strength made it likely that there\nwould be a second attempt up after a correction. It was probably a bull spike on some higher time frame chart.\nWedges usually don't fail before having at least a two-legged correction, so when the market gapped up and formed a bull trend bar, the bulls\nwere excited. However, on the very next bar, they were stopped out and smart traders saw this as a consecutive, opposite failure and shorted.\nBar 6 was a failed trend line break in a steep bear trend, so it was a micro trend line low 1 short. This was a low 1 short in a strong bear spike in\na possible new bear swing and therefore a reasonable trade.\nBar 7 set up a bear low 2 short setup, and was a small double top with bar 6.\nBar 8 was the deep correction that price action traders were looking for after the strong move up to bar 3. It was also two legs down on the day\nand a test of yesterday's low. Some traders saw the move down to bar 8 as a two-legged correction where the first leg down was to bar 4 and the\npullback was to a higher high.\nBar 9 was another chance to buy since it was a failed low 2, which usually results in at least two more legs up. This was a great trade because it\ntrapped bulls out of a strong up move and they would then have to chase the market up. An outside up failed low 1 or low 2 trap like this is common\nat the start of a strong trend and is a sign that the trend will likely go far.\nBar 10 was a strong up leg that broke the trend line and broke above the moving average and had many bull trend bars, so a higher low was\nlikely to follow. Bar 10 was also a moving average gap bar, but at this point you would be looking to buy a pullback and you would short only a great\nsetup and then only for a scalp. The trend was up since bar 9 until proven otherwise.\nBar 11 was a failed breakout from a bear micro channel, and bar 12 became a lower low breakout pullback buy setup.\nThe market formed two small bear trend bars en route to bar 13, and this is effectively a two-legged correction from the bar 12 reversal up. You\ncould have bought on bar 13, above the second bear trend bar, or on bar 14, after the inside bar that acted as a breakout pullback.

You could have looked for a high 2 on the 1\nminute chart to go long or waited for a 5 minute pause or pullback.\nBar 15 was not a good high 1 long because the move up was no longer a strong bull spike. It followed a small spike and climax bull move that\nreversed down from a small trend channel line overshoot (dashed line), and it was likely to correct sideways to down for at least a couple of legs.\nAlso, the signal bar was a strong bear trend bar, which was a sign of more two-sided trading.

AAPL closed yesterday with a tight trading range, which could have been a setup for a final flag. On bar 3, the first bar of the day, AAPL\nquickly broke below the bull flag from yesterday's close and then broke out of the top, forming a small wedge bull flag breakout. However, this\nbreakout also failed, and it reversed back down on the next bar. Although this two-bar reversal at bar 4 was a decent final flag short entry, the\nmomentum up was strong and the original failed breakout through the downside meant that it might have been better to wait for more price action\nbefore shorting. At this point, a failed flag breakout after a failed downside breakout and a reversal of yesterday's high made the bear case more\nlikely.\nBar 5 came at the end of a barbwire pattern that trapped bulls into buying a high 2, and was a great short entry at one tick below the low of the\nhigh 2 signal bar (the prior bar). This bar trapped the bulls long and it then forced them out. The market could have found support at the moving\naverage and within the bull flag between bars 2 and 3, so traders were cautious about their shorts. Any area of overlapping bars, especially when\nthey are large and when the tight trading range has multiple reversals, is an area of strong two-sided trading. Bulls will short below and not buy\nabove, and bears will short above and not below. The result is that breakouts tend to get pulled back into the range, as they were after the bear\nbreakouts at bars 3, 9, and 11 and the bull breakouts at bars 4 and 7.\nBar 6 was a signal to reverse to long, because it was a failed breakout, a second leg down to the moving average in a bull trend (most bars were\nabove a rising moving average), a two-bar reversal, and a bull bar on a pullback to the moving average.\nNote that the sell-off to bar 6 broke a trend line, indicating that the bears were willing to become aggressive, so traders were prepared for a\nfailed test of the bar 4 top of the bull trend.\nBar 7 was a reversal bar that failed in its breakout to a new high. It was the second failed attempt to break out above yesterday's high (bar 4 was\nthe first), and it created a wedge top and a higher high major trend reversal. Since the range of the day so far had been only about half of that of a\ntypical recent day, there was a good chance that a breakout in either direction would double the range and likely have at least two legs (the trend\ntraders would probably be confident enough to make at least a second push down after any pullback). Bar 7 was the second failed attempt to break\nout above yesterday's high, and when the market tries to do something twice and fails, it usually tries to go in the opposite direction. The bar 7\ndouble top (and third push up in the bull trend) was the top of the day.\nMany traders would have thought that the market became always-in short on the two strong bear trend bars that broke below the four-bar bull flag\nthat followed bar 7. Some traders would have wanted more evidence.\nBar 9 broke below the bar 6 swing low, but not the low of the day. Since the range was still small and the market twice failed to get follow-through\non the breakout above yesterday's high, the odds were very high that there would be at least one more push down to test the low of the day, which\nwas a magnet and in very close proximity. The market was now within its magnetic field.\nBar 10 completed a barbwire pattern, but since everyone was confident of a second leg down and a test to a new low of the day, it offered a\ngreat low 2 short below the small inside bar. It was also a breakout pullback entry from the breakout below bar 6. Finally, since it was such a large\nbreakout bar and it closed on its low, the traders who wanted more evidence that the market was in fact now always-in short were satisfied. There\nwas a lot of confidence that the market would work lower, maybe to around a measured move down.\nThe barbwire pullback to bar 10 broke a minor bear trend line (not shown), so it might have been the correction that ended the first leg down, but\nthe momentum down had been so strong that the bulls were not confident enough to buy aggressively yet. They needed more price action.\nThe break to the bar 11 new low of the day was essentially straight down, and therefore likely not the end of the move (traders will look for a\nsecond leg down to at least test the bar 11 low). Since it was a failed breakout of a bear trend channel line (the line began on the bar before bar 8),\ntwo legs up were likely first.\nBar 12 was a small double bottom pullback long setup after the small bar 11 double bottom, but in the absence of a prior good trend line break or\na strong reversal bar, it would only be a scalp. Also, since a second leg down was likely and there was no evidence that the always-in trade had\nreversed back up, it would have been much wiser to focus on getting short again or adding to shorts than allowing yourself to be distracted by a\nsmall bull scalp after seven sideways bars with big tails.\nBar 13 was another low 2 opportunity for the bears, but the rally to the moving average broke a good bear trend line. This was a signal to both the\nbulls and the bears that the next reversal up from a new swing low had a good chance of having two legs up, if the reversal was strong enough. The\nlow 2 short was a second entry, and it had a bear signal bar at the moving average, which increased the chance of success.\nBar 14 was another low 2 short and followed a reasonably strong two-bar bear spike down from bar 13.\nBar 15 was a two-bar reversal up from a break to a new low. It had a strong bull reversal bar off the new low after overshooting two bear trend\nchannel lines. It was the second leg down (the channel after a small spike, which was the first leg down) from the first trend line breakout pullback to\nbar 13 and a breakout test of the bar 1 lowest high of yesterday. Some traders saw it as a double bottom buy setup, and others saw it as a higher\nlow after a strong rally to bar 7. It was the second leg down from the high of the day and the bottom of a large wedge bull flag where bars 3 and 11\nwere the first two pushes down. All of these were signs of strength and increased the odds that the rally would have two legs.

AAPL closed yesterday with a tight trading range, which could have been a setup for a final flag. On bar 3, the first bar of the day, AAPL quickly broke below the bull flag from yesterday's close and then broke out of the top, forming a small wedge bull flag breakout. However, this breakout also failed, and it reversed back down on the next bar. Although this two-bar reversal at bar 4 was a decent final flag short entry, the momentum up was strong and the original failed breakout through the downside meant that it might have been better to wait for more price action before shorting. At this point, a failed flag breakout after a failed downside breakout and a reversal of yesterday's high made the bear case more likely.\nBar 5 came at the end of a barbwire pattern that trapped bulls into buying a high 2, and was a great short entry at one tick below the low of the high 2 signal bar (the prior bar). This bar trapped the bulls long and it then forced them out. The market could have found support at the moving average and within the bull flag between bars 2 and 3, so traders were cautious about their shorts. Any area of overlapping bars, especially when they are large and when the tight trading range has multiple reversals, is an area of strong two-sided trading. Bulls will short below and not buy above, and bears will short above and not below. The result is that breakouts tend to get pulled back into the range, as they were after the bear breakouts at bars 3, 9, and 11 and the bull breakouts at bars 4 and 7.\nBar 6 was a signal to reverse to long, because it was a failed breakout, a second leg down to the moving average in a bull trend (most bars were above a rising moving average), a two-bar reversal, and a bull bar on a pullback to the moving average.\nNote that the sell-off to bar 6 broke a trend line, indicating that the bears were willing to become aggressive, so traders were prepared for a failed test of the bar 4 top of the bull trend.\nBar 7 was a reversal bar that failed in its breakout to a new high. It was the second failed attempt to break out above yesterday's high (bar 4 was the first), and it created a wedge top and a higher high major trend reversal. Since the range of the day so far had been only about half of that of a typical recent day, there was a good chance that a breakout in either direction would double the range and likely have at least two legs (the trend traders would probably be confident enough to make at least a second push down after any pullback). Bar 7 was the second failed attempt to break out above yesterday's high, and when the market tries to do something twice and fails, it usually tries to go in the opposite direction. The bar 7 double top (and third push up in the bull trend) was the top of the day.\nMany traders would have thought that the market became always-in short on the two strong bear trend bars that broke below the four-bar bull flag that followed bar 7. Some traders would have wanted more evidence.\nBar 9 broke below the bar 6 swing low, but not the low of the day. Since the range was still small and the market twice failed to get follow-through on the breakout above yesterday's high, the odds were very high that there would be at least one more push down to test the low of the day, which was a magnet and in very close proximity. The market was now within its magnetic field.\nBar 10 completed a barbwire pattern, but since everyone was confident of a second leg down and a test to a new low of the day, it offered a great low 2 short below the small inside bar. It was also a breakout pullback entry from the breakout below bar 6. Finally, since it was such a large breakout bar and it closed on its low, the traders who wanted more evidence that the market was in fact now always-in short were satisfied. There was a lot of confidence that the market would work lower, maybe to around a measured move down.\nThe barbwire pullback to bar 10 broke a minor bear trend line (not shown), so it might have been the correction that ended the first leg down, but the momentum down had been so strong that the bulls were not confident enough to buy aggressively yet. They needed more price action.\nThe break to the bar 11 new low of the day was essentially straight down, and therefore likely not the end of the move (traders will look for a second leg down to at least test the bar 11 low). Since it was a failed breakout of a bear trend channel line (the line began on the bar before bar 8), two legs up were likely first.\nBar 12 was a small double bottom pullback long setup after the small bar 11 double bottom, but in the absence of a prior good trend line break or a strong reversal bar, it would only be a scalp. Also, since a second leg down was likely and there was no evidence that the always-in trade had reversed back up, it would have been much wiser to focus on getting short again or adding to shorts than allowing yourself to be distracted by a small bull scalp after seven sideways bars with big tails.\nBar 13 was another low 2 opportunity for the bears, but the rally to the moving average broke a good bear trend line. This was a signal to both the bulls and the bears that the next reversal up from a new swing low had a good chance of having two legs up, if the reversal was strong enough. The low 2 short was a second entry, and it had a bear signal bar at the moving average, which increased the chance of success.\nBar 14 was another low 2 short and followed a reasonably strong two-bar bear spike down from bar 13.\nBar 15 was a two-bar reversal up from a break to a new low. It had a strong bull reversal bar off the new low after overshooting two bear trend channel lines. It was the second leg down (the channel after a small spike, which was the first leg down) from the first trend line breakout pullback to bar 13 and a breakout test of the bar 1 lowest high of yesterday. Some traders saw it as a double bottom buy setup, and others saw it as a higher low after a strong rally to bar 7.

{"book": "REVERSAL", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\reversal3.pdf", "page_index": 153, "text_raw": "CHAPTER 19\nOpening Patterns and Reversals\nInstitutional traders have orders to fill before the day opens, and they want to fill them at the best possible price. For example, if they have mostly\nbuy orders and the market opens with a large gap down, they will buy immediately if they feel that the lower open represents a great value that won't\nlast long. If they believe that the market will trade down a little, then they will wait to buy lower. If the market instead opens with a gap up, they might\ndecide that the market should pull back. If that is their belief, there is no incentive for them to buy now because they expect that they will soon be\nable to buy lower. This creates a sell vacuum, and the market can move down quickly since the institutional bulls are simply waiting to buy at a more\nfavorable price. Invariably, they will wait until the market reaches a support level like the moving average, a trend line, a measured move, or a swing\nhigh or low. If enough institutions have order imbalances to the buy side and if they all begin their buying at around the same level, the sharp sell-off\ncan reverse up strongly. The sell-off wasn't as much due to strong bears as it was due to strong bulls who were simply waiting for the market to fall\nto a support level, whereupon they bought relentlessly and overwhelmed the bears. This is the vacuum effect; the market got sucked down quickly to\na level where there were lots of strong buyers waiting.\nThe opposite happens on days when the institutions have a lot of sell orders going into the open. There will often be a buy vacuum that sucks the\nmarket up quickly and then suddenly the bears appear and drive the market down hard. They were bearish from the open, but if they believed that\nthe market was going to trade up to some resistance level, they would refrain from shorting until the market reached the point where they thought\nthat it would not go higher. It does not make sense for them to short if they think the market will go a little higher. At that point, they begin shorting\nand they overwhelm the bulls. The result is an opening reversal down.\nThese sharp reversals up and down are opening reversals and often become either the high or the low of the day. If traders understand what is\ngoing on and do not get tricked into believing that all sharp moves are just spikes that will be followed by channels, they will be ready to swing trade\non the reversal and sometimes can hold part of their position for most of the day.\nAlthough most days have an opening reversal or trend from the open where there is a 50 to 60 percent chance of making at least twice the size\nof the risk, beginners struggle to determine which of the often several setups is that best one. The exact probabilities of any setup cannot be known\nwith a high degree of certainty because there are so many variables, and this is especially true of setups in the opening range, but the ones that I\nam using are reasonable guidelines. On most days, there are several reasonable reversals in the opening range, but they have only about a 30\npercent chance of leading to a swing trade where the reward is at least twice as large as the risk (although many have about a 60 percent chance\nof making a reward that is as large as the risk). Also, the earliest is sometimes the best one, but the several reversals that follow often pull back\nbeyond the entry price and scare beginners out of their positions. Beginners can either take one that they feel is strong and then simply rely on their\nprotective stops and allow for pullbacks, waiting for the ultimate breakout, or they can scalp for a reward that is equal to their risk and then trade in\nthe opposite direction if the next reversal setup looks good. Most traders have a better chance of becoming profitable if they take what they believe\nis a good setup, rely on their protective stops, and allow the pullbacks, exiting only if a strong signal in the opposite direction forms.\nThe first bar of the day has about a 20 percent chance of being either the high or the low of the day for all markets. If it is a strong trend bar\nwithout big tails, it has a 30 percent chance. Either the high or the low forms within the first five bars or so in 50 percent of days, and it forms within\nthe first hour or two in 90 percent of days. Even though most reversals do not lead to a profit that is at least twice as large as the risk, if a trader held\nthem for a swing, most would end up as scalps. The profits from the winning trades are usually at least as large as the losses from the losing trades,\nand the occasional big winner makes this approach worthwhile. Alternatively, a trader can simply look to scalp for a reward that is at least as large\nas the risk. The high of the day usually comes from some kind of double top, even though the two highs are often not at the same price, and the low\nof the day usually comes from a double bottom. In general, if the day is having reversals, a trader should wait until there is a double top or bottom\nbefore looking for a swing trade. Once one forms, it has about a 40 to 50 percent chance of leading to a swing, depending on the context and the\nsetup, and an extreme of the day.\nMost traders should work hard to become experts at spotting and trading the best opening reversals, and make these swing trades the\ncornerstone of their trading. For example, when the average range in the Emini is about 10 to 15 points, the probability of a four-point swing on a\nreasonably good-looking opening reversal (one where the context is good and there is a decent signal bar) is often only about 40 percent (it can be\n50 to 60 percent when the setup is very strong). However, the chance of a two-point stop being hit before either the profit target is reached or a\nreversal signal develops, where the trader can exit with a smaller loss or a small profit, is often only about 30 percent. This makes the trader's\nequation very favorable for this type of trade. If traders win four points in four out of 10 trades, they have 16 points of profit off of their swing trades. If\nthey then have maybe three losses of two points or less and three wins of about one to three points, they will end up about breakeven on those\ntrades. This is fairly typical when a trader picks appropriate setups. The trader then has about 16 points of profit on 10 trades, and averages 1.6\npoints of profit per trade, which is good for a day trader.\nWhen there is not a reversal, the spike in fact can be followed by a channel and the day can become a spike and channel trend day. If there is a\nreversal, but it lasts for only a few bars and then reverses back in the direction of the spike, the reversal attempt has failed and has become a\nbreakout pullback setup that will usually be followed by some type of channel. For example, if the market rallies up strongly on the first three bars of\nthe day but then has a bear reversal bar, many traders will reverse to short below that bar. However, if the spike is strong and the reversal bar is\nweak, more traders will assume that the reversal attempt will fail. They will place buy stop orders above the high of the prior bar in any pullback,\nincluding the high of the bear reversal bar if there is no pullback. If the market trades up, the small sell-off becomes a breakout pullback and the\nreversal attempt will have failed. Some bulls will place buy limit orders at and below the reversal bar if they are especially confident of the strength of\nthe up move.\nThe open always leads to a breakout or a reversal, and sometimes to both. Other than gap openings, common patterns on the open are the\nsame as patterns occurring at any other time of the day and include:\nTrends from the open, which were discussed in Part I in the first book.\nBreakouts and reversals, which are failed breakouts.

For example, if they have mostly buy orders and the market opens with a large gap down, they will buy immediately if they feel that the lower open represents a great value that won't last long. If they believe that the market will trade down a little, then they will wait to buy lower. If the market instead opens with a gap up, they might decide that the market should pull back. If that is their belief, there is no incentive for them to buy now because they expect that they will soon be able to buy lower. This creates a sell vacuum, and the market can move down quickly since the institutional bulls are simply waiting to buy at a more favorable price. Invariably, they will wait until the market reaches a support level like the moving average, a trend line, a measured move, or a swing high or low. If enough institutions have order imbalances to the buy side and if they all begin their buying at around the same level, the sharp sell-off can reverse up strongly. The sell-off wasn't as much due to strong bears as it was due to strong bulls who were simply waiting for the market to fall to a support level, whereupon they bought relentlessly and overwhelmed the bears. This is the vacuum effect; the market got sucked down quickly to a level where there were lots of strong buyers waiting.\nThe opposite happens on days when the institutions have a lot of sell orders going into the open. There will often be a buy vacuum that sucks the market up quickly and then suddenly the bears appear and drive the market down hard. They were bearish from the open, but if they believed that the market was going to trade up to some resistance level, they would refrain from shorting until the market reached the point where they thought that it would not go higher. It does not make sense for them to short if they think the market will go a little higher. At that point, they begin shorting and they overwhelm the bulls. The result is an opening reversal down.\nThese sharp reversals up and down are opening reversals and often become either the high or the low of the day. If traders understand what is going on and do not get tricked into believing that all sharp moves are just spikes that will be followed by channels, they will be ready to swing trade on the reversal and sometimes can hold part of their position for most of the day.\nAlthough most days have an opening reversal or trend from the open where there is a 50 to 60 percent chance of making at least twice the size of the risk, beginners struggle to determine which of the often several setups is that best one. The exact probabilities of any setup cannot be known with a high degree of certainty because there are so many variables, and this is especially true of setups in the opening range, but the ones that I am using are reasonable guidelines. On most days, there are several reasonable reversals in the opening range, but they have only about a 30 percent chance of leading to a swing trade where the reward is at least twice as large as the risk (although many have about a 60 percent chance of making a reward that is as large as the risk). Also, the earliest is sometimes the best one, but the several reversals that follow often pull back beyond the entry price and scare beginners out of their positions. Beginners can either take one that they feel is strong and then simply rely on their protective stops and allow for pullbacks, waiting for the ultimate breakout, or they can scalp for a reward that is equal to their risk and then trade in the opposite direction if the next reversal setup looks good.

Once one of the day's extremes is formed, the market\nreverses toward what will become the other extreme of the day. Obviously, there is no reversal on a trend from the open day, but the market still\nworks toward the other extreme, which will usually be near the close of the day. The opening reversal is often recognizable and can be a great\ntrading opportunity for a swing trade. The first move on the open is often fast and covers many points, and it is hard to believe that it could suddenly\nreverse direction, but this is a common occurrence. The turn is usually at some key point like a test of the high or low of yesterday, a swing high or\nlow of yesterday or today, a breakout of a trading range of yesterday or today, a trend line or trend channel line, a moving average, or any of the\nabove on a different time frame chart or on the Globex chart. Even if the best setup is on a 60 minute or daily chart, there will almost always be a\nprice action reason to take the trade based entirely on the 5 minute day session chart, so traders adept at chart reading only need to watch the one\nchart that they are using for trading.\nThe initial price action often reveals the character of the day. If the first bar is a doji bar in the middle of yesterday's closing range, then the bar is\na one-bar trading range, and the odds of a trading range day are increased. If the first hour has many overlapping bars with big tails and multiple\nreversals, the odds of a trading range day are also increased. In contrast, if there is a gap up or down and then a three- or four-bar bear spike\nwithin the first hour and the trend bars are large with little overlap and only small tails, the odds of a bear trend day increase. Traders often look for a\npair of consecutive bull trend bars in the first hour or so. If they are present, traders would see them as a sign that the market is always-in long, at\nleast for a scalp. This means that they think that the market might be in the early stages of a bull trend. Until there is enough follow-through for\ntraders to believe that a measured move of some kind is likely, many traders will scalp most or all of their position. This leads to the many reversals\nthat are common in the first hour or so. If instead there were consecutive strong bear trend bars, they would assume that the market was always-in\nshort and that the day was trying to become a bear trend day. For example, if there have been consecutive strong bear trend bars and then a bar\ntrades above the high of the prior bar, many traders will short below the low of that pullback bar for a scalp. If the context is right, they might think that\nthe pullback is the start of a large trend and they will swing most or all of their trade.\nThe opening range often gives clues to how the day will unfold, provides support and resistance for the rest of the day, and leads to measured\nmove projections. There are almost always several choices for the top and bottom of the opening range, so there will rarely ever be perfect\nagreement as to the exact bars that contain it or the length of time that it takes to form. In general, it is the height of either the trading range, if there\nis one, or the largest leg of the first 30 to 90 minutes. Sometimes the leg will have two or three smaller legs within it, and sometimes there will be a\npullback and then a brief higher high or low or lower high or low. If there is that new extreme, some traders will use that to enlarge the opening\nrange, and others will continue to use the original range and will view the new extreme as a meaningless overshoot.\nIt is helpful to classify the size of the opening range into three categories. If the range is only about 25 percent of the size of the range of recent\ndays, traders will enter on a breakout of the range in either direction. A couple of times a month, this will become a trend from the open day with\nsmall pullbacks and relentless progression.\nIf the opening range is about a third to a half the size of the range of recent days, traders will assume that the range will grow to about the size of\nan average day. The day will usually have some trading range activity and then break out up or down. About two-thirds of the time it will become a\ntrend day, which will usually be a trending trading range day, although any type of trend day is possible. The breakout will typically reach about a\nmeasured move based on the height of the opening range. It will usually come back and test the breakout point later in the day, and it often then\nbreaks back into the earlier range. If the reversal back into the opening range is strong and the market closes at the opposite side of that earlier\nrange, the day becomes a reversal day. This is in fact the most common way that reversal days form. In the other third of cases, the day just trades\na little beyond the opening range, then reverses and breaks out of the opposite side of the range, and then trades back into the range. When this\nhappens, the day usually becomes a small trading range day, but sometimes that second breakout can lead to a trending trading range day in the\nopposite direction.\nThe third possibility is when the opening move is large. This is usually due to a strong spike and the day often becomes a spike and channel\ntrend day, but sometimes it leads to a climactic reversal, usually after a small final flag.\nAn important point to recognize is that if the market makes a strong move on the open and then reverses, that initial strong move indicates\nstrength, and it may return later in the day. For example, if the market sells off strongly for the first four bars of the day and then reverses up into a\nstrong bull trend, you should remember the initial bear trend and not assume that the bulls will control the market until the close. That initial downside\nstrength indicates that bears were willing to aggressively short the market earlier in the day and may look for another opportunity later in the day,\ndespite the bull trend. So if there is a strong correction in the bull trend, do not ignore the possibility that it could be another trend change taking\nplace, this time back to a bear trend.\nThe patterns in the first hour are the same as those later in the day, but the reversals are often more violent and the trends tend to last longer. An\nimportant key to maximizing trading profits is to swing part of any position that could be a high or a low of the day. If the trade looks particularly\nstrong, swing all of the position and take partial profits on a third to a half after the trade has run one to two times your initial risk. If you bought what\nyou think could be the low of the day and your initial stop was below the signal bar, which was about three points below your entry price, take about\na quarter to half off at around two to four points and maybe another quarter to half off at four to six points. Alternatively, instead of using fixed limit\norders, take some off at the first pause after two points of profit and some more off at the first pause after four points. Hold the remaining contracts\nuntil there is a clear and strong opposite signal or until your breakeven stop is hit. Look to add to your position at every with-trend setup, like a two-\nlegged pullback to the moving average in a strong trend. For these additional contracts, scalp most or all of the position, but continue to swing\nsome contracts.\nSome reversals start quietly, trend only slightly for many bars, and appear to be just another flag in the old trend, but then the market forcefully\nbreaks into an opposite trend. For example, a bear flag can break out to the upside and the market could reverse into a bull trend. Other reversals\nhave strong momentum from the entry bar. Be open to all possibilities and try to take every signal, especially if it is strong. One of the difficulties is\nthat reversals often are sharp and traders might not have enough time to convince themselves that a reversal setup could actually lead to a reversal.\nHowever, if there is a strong trend bar for the signal bar, the chances of success are good and you must take the trade. If you feel like you need\nmore time to assess the setup, at least take a half or a quarter position because the trade might suddenly move very far very fast and you need to\nbe involved, even if in only a small way. Then look to add on at the first pullback.\nUnlike a double bottom pullback that is a reversal pattern, a double bottom bull flag is a continuation pattern that develops after the bull trend has\nalready begun. Functionally, it is the same as a double bottom pullback, since both are buy setups.\nThe same is true for a double top bear flag, which is a continuation pattern in an ongoing bear trend and not a reversal pattern, like the double top\npullback. Both, however, are short setups.

They all usually are because different\ntraders will make decisions based on different ones, but on the day shown in Figure 19.1 none led to a precise guide for profit taking or reversals.\nMost support levels, like measured move projections, do not lead to reversals, because the market has inertia and therefore a strong tendency to\ncontinue to do what it has been doing. This means that most reversal attempts fail. However, when the market finally reverses, it is always at a\nsupport level. If there is a strong reversal setup at a support level, it is more likely to lead to a profitable trade. By bar 5, the range of the day was still\nonly about half the average range of recent days, so the odds favored a significant increase in the range. With each new reversal, the opening\nrange expanded, but the sell-off down to bar 6 was strong, so the breakout was likely to lead to an approximate measured move down.\nThe day became a trending trading range day and broke back into the upper range at the end of the day, which is common. Here, the day closed\nnear the top of the upper range and became a reversal day. Most reversal days begin as trending trading range days. If traders understand this,\nthey can look to swing part of their trade off the reversal up from the bottom of the lower range.\nOnly about 25 percent of reversals in the first hour or so result in swings, so it is better to scalp until there is either a double bottom or top or a\nclear always-in setup, where the odds are good for a swing. Today was an ordinary day where the first many setups were only scalps. Bar 3 was a\ndouble top with bar 1 and therefore had about a 50 percent chance of being the high of the day. It was also a breakout pullback to the moving\naverage. Bar 4 was a double bottom with bar 2 and had a 50 percent chance of being the low of the day. Neither was the high or low of today. The\nhigh or low occurs within the first couple of hours in 90 percent of the days, and it usually comes from some type of double top or bottom. Bar 5\nformed a double top with bar 3, a small wedge top, and a moving average gap bar, and it became the high of the day.\nWhen retail investors controlled a bigger part of the daily volume, they contributed more to opening gaps and reversals by placing orders before\nthe open, based on the daily chart. For example, if there was a bull reversal bar, traders would see that after the close and place orders before the\nopen to buy above the high of that bar. They were so afraid of missing the buy that they were willing to buy on the open, even if they bought above\nthe high of the bar. This often resulted in the market gapping up to find enough sellers willing to take the other side of the trade.

They then bought\nheavily, reversing the market up to a new high, creating the opening bull reversal. The small, brief sell-off on the open creates a tail on the bottom of\nthe bull trend bar on the daily chart, which is common on bull trend days. The opposite happened after bear days where desperate longs were so\neager to exit on the open that they were willing to sell the first trade of the day. The market often had to gap down to find enough buyers.

The gap up was a bull spike, and the move from bar 8\nto bar 9 was a bear spike. This was a climactic reversal setup and was followed by a trading range, as is often the case. During the trading range,\nboth the bulls and the bears were adding to their positions in an attempt to get follow-through in the form of a channel.

The bulls made two attempts to reverse the bearish\nimplications of the lower high and they failed twice.

On most days, there are gap\nopenings on the 5 minute chart. They can be thought of as simple breakouts since the market broke out of the final bar of the prior day. They should\nbe traded like any other breakout except traders know that large gaps increase the chance that the day will become a trend day. The larger the gap,\nthe more likely the day will be a trend day and the more likely the gap will function as a spike and be followed by a trending channel in the same\ndirection. For example, a large gap up has perhaps a 50 percent chance of being followed by a bull channel, a 20 percent chance of being followed\nby a trading range, and a 30 percent chance of being followed by a bear trend. These probabilities are only guidelines because using computer\ntesting to find exact numbers is subject to too many variables. How big does a gap have to be to be thought of as large? How much of a rally after\nthe gap up constitutes a channel instead of just a slightly upward-sloping trading range? How much of a sell-off constitutes a reversal compared to\njust a deep pullback? As another guideline, if the gap is the largest gap of the past five days or so, or if it is larger than about half of the average\ndaily range, it can be considered to be a large gap.\nA large gap opening on the 5 minute chart from yesterday's close represents extreme behavior and often results in a trend day in either direction.\nIt does not matter whether there is also a gap on the daily chart, since the trading will be the same. The only thing that matters is how the market\nresponds to this relatively extreme behavior—will it accept it or reject it? The larger a gap is, the more likely it will be the start of a trend day away\nfrom yesterday's close. The size, direction, and number of trend bars in the first few bars of the day often reveal the direction of the trend day that is\nlikely to follow. Sometimes the market will trend from the opening bar or two, but more commonly it will test in the wrong direction and then reverse\ninto a trend that will last all day. Whenever you see a large gap opening, it is wise to assume that there will be a strong trend. However, sometimes\nit might take an hour to begin, and the trend often begins with a two-legged countertrend move, like a two-legged pullback to the moving average or\na double bottom or top. Sometimes it has a third push and forms a wedge flag. Make sure to swing part of every trade, even if you get stopped out\nof your swing portion on a few trades. One good swing trade can be as profitable as 10 scalps, so don't give up until it is clear that the day will not\ntrend.\nThe gap should be looked at as if it is one huge, invisible trend bar. For example, if there is a large gap up and it is followed by a minor pullback\nand then a channel type of rally for the rest of the day, this is likely a gap spike and channel bull trend, with the gap being the spike. For the Emini,\nyou can look at the S&P cash index and see that the first bar of the day is a large trend bar, and it corresponds to the gap on the Emini.\nTrade the open like any other open and look for a trend from the open, a failed breakout (a reversal), or a breakout pullback. The only difference\nfrom other days is that you should look to swing more aggressively; and if the day begins to trend, look for pullbacks where you can add onto your\nposition. You should always look to take partial profits along the way, which can be scalps, but as long as the trend is strong, keep looking to take\nmore entries in the direction of the trend.\nJust because there is an increased chance of a trend day does not mean that there will be a trend day. Most big gap days have some trading\nrange behavior for the first five to 10 bars as the bulls and bears fight over the direction of the trend, and some continue as trading range days all\nday long. Be open to all possibilities, and don't get locked into a belief. Your job is to follow the market. You have no ability to influence it and\ncertainly zero chance of telepathically making it go in the direction that you want. If you are wrong, get out and stop hoping that the market will do the\nlow-probability thing and suddenly go your way. If there is a big gap but the price action is unclear, assume that the market is forming a trading\nrange and look to buy low and sell high. There might be several scalps before there is a setup that has a good chance of leading to a swing.\nFIGURE 20.1 A Gap Is Just a Spike\nAs shown in Figure 20.1, a gap opening on a 5 minute chart is just another form of a breakout and a spike.

Each bar closed as soon as the volume in the bar\npassed 10,000 contracts. Since the final trade in each bar can have any number of contracts, most of the bars have more than 10,000 contracts\ninstead of exactly 10,000 contracts. The bars are not based on time, so some bars might take a few seconds to form, while others may take more\nthan 10 minutes to surpass 10,000 contracts.\nBars 3, 4, and 5 were shorts on tests of the moving average in a bear trend.\nBar 6 was a second-entry bear trend channel line overshoot and reversal up, but the signal bar was weak (a small doji). However, the rally from\nthe bar 6 wedge reversal broke the trend line, setting up a long on a test of the low.\nBar 7 was a two-legged higher low, but it was a doji, which is a sign of two-sided trading and not of strong buying, and it followed two strong bear\ntrend bars. Although this was a minimally acceptable buy setup, it would have been better to wait for a stronger signal. If you took it, you would have\nexited below bar 8 because that was a low 2 short setup at the moving average and it had a bear body. That is a strong sell signal, and\ncountertrend traders should have exited and possibly even reversed on any second attempt by the bears to resume the trend. Countertrend traders\ntrying to buy in a bear trend should always exit on a low 2 signal, unless the trend has clearly already reversed and the low 2 setup is likely to fail.\nBar 11 is an example of this.\nBar 9 was a lower low major trend reversal and breakout pullback from the breakout of the wedge bottom that ended at bar 6, and a buy setup for\na possible strong trend reversal. It was also a bear trend channel overshoot and reversal, and it was a bull reversal bar and a two-bar reversal. The\ntrading range from bar 6 to bar 9 was a tight channel and became the final flag of the bear trend. Also, it was a reversal from a larger wedge\nchannel following the spike down to bar 2. The channel of a spike and channel bear often ends with three pushes and it did here (bars 2, 6, and 9).\nBar 10 was a breakout above an inside bar that ended the first tiny pullback (bear trend bar), so traders could have gone long above it or added\nto their longs from above bar 9. After the spike and channel bear (bar 2 ended the spike) and the three pushes down (bars 2, 6, and 9 ended them),\nit was likely that a protracted two-legged up move would develop, so the bar 10 pause was likely to just be part of the first leg up and not the start of\nthe second leg up. After a bear channel that lasted 20 or 30 bars, the correction was likely to have at least half as many bars as a general rule. If the\ncorrection is too small, bears will be hesitant to short and bulls would continue to buy because they would suspect that the correction needed more\nbars for clarity. Both needed to see if the market was reversing, and the four-bar bull spike up from bar 10 was strong evidence that it was. The\nbear spike and channel formation was likely to retrace to around the bar 3 start of the channel, which it did. Longs often take profits there. This is\nthe area where some started to scale in, and once the market gets back to their very first entry, they often exit their entire position. They got out of\ntheir original longs that they established between bars 2 and 3 at about breakeven, and they made a profit on all of their lower entries. Bears often\nshort aggressively again because they know that the market started down from this area earlier in the day, and it could do the same again. The day\nwas over and there was not enough time left for the bears to make a profit, so they therefore chose to not short into the close.\nBar 11 was a high 2 buy setup (the high 1 was two bars earlier) after a strong bull spike. Traders were expecting at least two legs up, and this\ntwo-legged pullback was so small compared to the size of the spike that it might not have signified the end of the first leg up. Traders believed that\none of three things was happening: the pullback was so small that it was just part of a complex first leg; the first leg was over and the second leg up\nwas beginning; or the first leg was over and there would be a deeper pullback and then a move above the top of this leg. All three possibilities\nmeant that the market was going higher and this was therefore a great buying opportunity. Yes, bar 11 was an entry bar from a two-bar reversal top,\nwhich was the second entry for a moving average gap bar short in a bear trend. This might have led to a test of the bear low. However, the spike up\nflipped the market to always-in long in the minds of most traders, so the chance of the short going very far was small. Most traders saw the reversal\nas much stronger than the short setup.\nFIGURE 21.2 Strong Open in the EUR/USD\n", "text_clean": "CHAPTER 21\nDetailed Day Trading Examples This chapter provides many detailed examples of reasonable day trades that incorporate the fundamental ideas from all three books.\nFIGURE 21.1 T-Note 10,000-Share Chart Figure 21.1 is a 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures chart based on 10,000 shares per bar.

This is the area where some started to scale in, and once the market gets back to their very first entry, they often exit their entire position. They got out of their original longs that they established between bars 2 and 3 at about breakeven, and they made a profit on all of their lower entries. Bears often short aggressively again because they know that the market started down from this area earlier in the day, and it could do the same again. The day was over and there was not enough time left for the bears to make a profit, so they therefore chose to not short into the close.\nBar 11 was a high 2 buy setup (the high 1 was two bars earlier) after a strong bull spike. Traders were expecting at least two legs up, and this two-legged pullback was so small compared to the size of the spike that it might not have signified the end of the first leg up. Traders believed that one of three things was happening: the pullback was so small that it was just part of a complex first leg; the first leg was over and the second leg up was beginning; or the first leg was over and there would be a deeper pullback and then a move above the top of this leg. All three possibilities meant that the market was going higher and this was therefore a great buying opportunity. Yes, bar 11 was an entry bar from a two-bar reversal top, which was the second entry for a moving average gap bar short in a bear trend. This might have led to a test of the bear low. However, the spike up flipped the market to always-in long in the minds of most traders, so the chance of the short going very far was small. Most traders saw the reversal as much stronger than the short setup.\nFIGURE 21.2 Strong Open in the EUR/USD", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["CHAPTER 21", "Detailed Day Trading Examples", "This chapter provides many detailed examples of reasonable day trades that incorporate the fundamental ideas from all three books.", "FIGURE 21.1 T-Note 10,000-Share Chart", "Figure 21.1 is a 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures chart based on 10,000 shares per bar.

The most common signals are those based on yesterday's high and low, and you can see them on a 5 minute chart.\nHowever, there are frequently price action entries on these longer time frames, but because the signal bars are so large, far fewer contracts can be\ntraded if the risk is to be the same as for a day trade. Also, overnight risk may mean that you should reduce your contracts even further or consider\ntrading option strategies that have a limited risk, like outright purchases or spreads. A day trader should trade these charts only if they do not\noccupy his thoughts during the trading day, because it is easy to miss a few day trades using large volume while nursing a trade of far fewer\ncontracts or shares based on the daily chart, and these misses can more than offset any gain from the daily signal.\nAlthough all stocks form standard price action patterns, stocks of very small companies that have little institutional ownership have a significant\nrisk of unusually big moves up and down. They tend to be more volatile, and in stock market terminology, these stocks are called high-beta stocks.\nFor example, you would not expect Wal-Mart (WMT) to jump 1,000 percent in a month, but when a small drug company gets its one drug approved\nby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or is suddenly a takeover candidate, this is exactly what can happen. Some traders like the huge, fast\nmoves, but most traders prefer to avoid the risk of sudden, huge moves in both directions and bad fills on their trades. Traders who trade these\nspecial situations have to watch the stocks very closely, which makes it difficult for them to trade other stocks at the same time. Since the risk is so\ngreat, they can only trade a small portion of their portfolio this way and this erases most of the gain derived from the big moves. When you add the\nstress of the unpredictability, most traders should not bother with these stocks.\nWhen trading counter to a strong trend, the goal should be a scalp of 1 or 2 percent, since most countertrend trades just result in pullbacks that\nbecome with-trend entries. Gaps complicate the entries and, in general, the risk is less if the market opens within yesterday's range and then\ntrades through the entry stop at one tick beyond that range. If you cannot watch the stock intraday and there is a gap open, it is probably best to\npass on the trade. If you can watch the stock and there is a gap opening, watch for a gap pullback and then enter on the failed pullback into the gap,\nas the market resumes its move away from yesterday's range. In other words, if you were looking to buy but today gapped up, look for a sell-off on\nthe open today and then buy an opening reversal back up, placing your protective stop below the low of today. If the entry fails and your stop is hit,\nlook elsewhere or give it only one more try if there is a second buy setup. Don't spend too much time on a stock that is not doing what you wanted it\nto do, because you will lose money. There is a natural tendency to want to make back your money on the same stock after a loss, but this is a sign\nof your emotional weakness. If you feel a need to prove that you were right and are in fact a great chart reader, you might be right about that, but you\nare not a great trader. Great traders accept their losses and move on.\nPullbacks on daily charts rarely have classic reversal bars, leaving traders with more uncertainty than when trading 5 minute charts. Uncertainty\nmeans risk, and when there is more risk, position sizes need to be smaller, and a trader will have to consider taking a partial position and adding to\nthe position as the price action unfolds. In a bull pullback, additions can be made at a lower price if the market sells off a little more, but the bears\nhave not yet demonstrated that they are in control. Additions can also be made at a higher price after the trend has resumed and a small pullback\nforms a higher low above your original entry.\nWhen you scan your daily charts at the end of the day, you will frequently see setups to consider for the next day. Once the setup triggers, there\nwill often be an intraday trend that will provide you with many good 5 minute with-trend entries. If the stock is not one that you normally trade intraday\nbut its volume is about five million shares or more, it is worth considering adding it to your basket of day trading stocks for a day or two.\nSometimes, however, even with very liquid stocks such as the Oil Service HOLDRS (OIH), your broker might not have an inventory available for\nselling short, and you might only be able to trade buy setups. If you really want to short, you can buy puts instead, even for a day trade.\nSince round numbers are magnets, they can set up trades. For example, if Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is up 20 percent over the past few months\nand is now trading at 93, many traders will assume that it will reach 100. Because of this, bears will not short aggressively, because they believe\nthat they soon will be able to short at a better price, and bulls will buy aggressively because they believe that FCX will go above the magnet. This\nabsence of bears creates a vacuum effect that often results in the stock quickly moving up to the magnet. It will typically go 5 to 10 percent above\nthe magnet before it pulls back, and it usually pulls back below the round number at least once before it decides what it will do next. Bulls can buy as\nit rallies into the magnetic field of the round number and take profits just above it, and bears can wait to short until the market is above and then take\nprofits on the test back down.

This makes the bull trend\nline up from bar 10 vulnerable to a downside breakout.

The dollar, along with the Swiss franc and\nJapanese yen, are risk-off currencies, and traders tend to buy them when they think that the stock market will fall.\nThe dollar had a bull spike up as it broke above the top of the bear flag at bar 2, converting the market to always-in long. It then formed a channel,\nfollowed by the bar 5 test of the bottom of the bar 3 start of the channel. This created a double bottom bull flag at bar 5 and was followed by a\nbreakout pullback buy setup at bar 7. The market topped out at the bar 11 higher high. Some traders saw the move from bar 3 to bar 11 as a broad\nchannel, and others saw the channel as starting at bars 5 or 7. All traders suspected that bar 11 or bar 13 could be the start of the correction down\nto the bottom of the channel, because the market was becoming two-sided with several reversals and prominent bear bodies. These represented\naccumulating selling pressure.\nThe move down to bar 10 was a strong bear trend bar, and it broke below a steep bull trend line up from bar 7 (not shown). This was a strong\nenough move to make many bulls take profits on the rally to the new high at bar 11. Bears started shorting at that higher high and even more\naggressively at the bar 13 lower high major trend reversal. The move down to bar 12 had two strong bear trend bars and broke below the bull trend\nline. The market should have had at least two legs down, but instead it had a bear spike down to bar 14 and then a channel down to bar 18. The\nmove down to bar 14 convinced most traders that the market had flipped to always-in short and therefore should be followed by more selling.\nThe bear channel continued down to bar 18, which was the fifth bar in a sell climax at the end of a big bear trend. Traders expected a rally, at\nleast to the moving average. It was also a double bottom with bar 1.\nThere was a 20 gap bar short at the moving average, but since the spike up was strong, it was better to wait for a second signal. The second\nsignal came with the bar 19 moving average gap bar, which formed a double top bear flag with the high of the small rally after bar 17.\nThe spike down to bar 20 was followed by a parabolic and therefore climactic channel down to bar 22, where the market formed a lower low\nmajor trend reversal. There, the market went sideways in a variation of an iii pattern (bodies only). It had a failed low 1 short that reversed up in a\nsmall double bottom, and the bull spike up to bar 23 was exceptionally strong. This probably flipped the market to always-in long and would have\nmade the bulls try to keep the market above the bottom of the spike. They bought aggressively near the low and they also did at bars 27 and 29,\ncreating a double bottom bull flag. Bar 27 was a double bottom major trend reversal, and bar 29 was a reversal up from the third push down in a\ntriangle, which could ultimately have a breakout up or down.\nThe wedge bull flag (bars 24, 26, 27) was followed by another rally and then a double bottom at bar 29. This was a good risk/reward setup for a\nlong, since a trader would be buying at the bottom of a trading range. The probability of an equidistant move up was probably 60 percent, since the\nmarket was at the bottom of a trading range. The risk was about $5.00 with a 60 percent chance of a test of the bar 28 top of the trading range. A\ntrader would be risking $5.00 to make $10.00 with a probability of 60 percent, which is very good. The average profit per trade would be about\n$4.00. Since this was also a double bottom bull flag, the odds were probably better than 60 percent. The target would be a measured move up out\nof this trading range, and it would test to around the bar 15 top of the bear channel.\nIt is important to realize that this means that there was about a 40 percent chance that the market would fall below the bar 22 low, so traders\nwould need to exit if that happened. If it did, the next target would be a measured move down, based on the height of the bar 27 to 28 or bar 22 to\n23 legs down.\nEven if the market does go up, the odds favor that it will stall around the bar 11 high and form a larger trading range.\nFIGURE 22.6 Round Numbers Can Be Support and Resistance\n", "text_clean": "As shown in Figure 22.4, the monthly gold chart is in a wedge channel after the bull spike from bar 7 to bar 8.

Once enough traders became convinced that the magnet would be reached, the bears stopped\nshorting, and the market rallied in a buy vacuum to above the target. For example, the bears believed that the market would get above $300 and\nprobably at least 5 to 10 percent above, because that is what the market usually does once it is in the magnetic pull of a round number. Since the\nbears expected the market to reach around $315 (5 percent above the round number), they stepped aside. It did not make sense for them to short\nbefore the market got there when they believed that the market would be higher within a few bars.

You could try to limit any potential loss with a stop on your\ncall, but even if the market falls far below your stop without it being filled, at least you know that your risk is not catastrophic even if the stop order\nwas never processed (assuming that your position size was reasonable). How can the market fall through your protective stop and not trigger it?\nThe stop is based on the last trade, and if no trades took place in your particular option, the bid and ask might fall too far below your stop, but your\nstop would not get filled and your option would be worth much less than you thought. It is important to understand that protective stops in options\noften offer no protection, and if the market is moving quickly against you, you should try to exit on a limit order as soon as you can.\nYou can also consider day trading SPY options instead of the SPY or the Emini, especially when you are starting out and if you are afraid of a\nhuge loss. For example, if you buy a one-month-out, at-the-money (ATM) call in the SPY, it might cost about $250, which is the most that you could\nlose even if the SPY falls to zero (obviously this assumes that you bought the call and did not make a mistake, like instead shorting a naked put or\ncall). Even if the SPY fell 1 percent over the next hour, you could probably get out of your call with under a $100 loss. If you bought the call during a\npullback in a bull trend, the odds are good that you would be able to exit with a 10 to 20 cent profit, which translates into a $10 to $20 profit. This\nwould require about a 25 to 45 cent move in the SPY. If the SPY instead fell 50 cents, you could get out of your call with maybe a 30 cent loss, which\nis $30. Buying puts or calls gives beginning traders more certainty about the most they have at risk, and this might make it easier for them to think\nabout how to trade without constantly worrying about the dollars.\nIf you take only a couple of day trades a day in the futures or stock markets, then you can be more active in the options market, especially if you\nalso actively swing trade stocks. The opportunities could fill another book, but a few points are worth making here. For example, if you are long a\nstock that is basing on the daily chart and you are willing to add on lower, you could sell a put at one strike below the market. You collect the\npremium if your stock goes up or even drops a little, and if instead it goes down below the strike of the put, the buyer of that put will put the stock to\nyou (you will be forced to buy it at the strike price) and you will therefore be adding to your long stock position at that lower price.\nAnother common use of options for traders who are long stock is to sell out-of-the-money (OTM) calls to collect premium. This covered call\nwriting can add about a 10 percent return to your portfolio every year, but it will occasionally take you out of a stock that is exploding upward.\nIf you are expecting a big move in a stock or a futures contract but you don't know the direction, you can buy a straddle (buy both a put and a call),\nbut then you suffer time decay, commissions, and bid-ask spreads on both legs. Straddles are rarely worthwhile. An alternative for futures traders is\nto combine the futures and options in a delta-neutral position, meaning that it has an equal chance of going up or down. For example, in the Emini,\none long contract is equal to buying 500 SPY or 10 at-the-money calls. If you buy one Emini contract (or 500 SPY) and 10 ATM puts (alternatively,\nyou could short one Emini or 500 SPY and buy 10 ATM calls), this is a delta-neutral position at the moment that you placed the trade. If the market\nmoves up or down, the delta changes. If the market goes up, your Emini will make more than your puts will lose; if the market goes down, your puts\nwill gain more than your Emini will lose. You lose money only if the market goes sideways for several days, because your option will decay. There is\na lot of fine-tuning that you can do to increase your return as the market moves, but Emini day traders are too busy to add this to their trading.\nOption traders often talk about catalysts, which are upcoming news events that can lead to big moves in a stock. The most common one is an\nupcoming earnings report, and less common ones include anticipated information about new products or possible takeovers. Because there is\nuncertainty and the potential for a big move up or down is large, the premium is usually greatly inflated. As soon as the news is announced, the\npremium gets crushed, so much so that you can see the big move in the direction that you expected and still lose money! For example, suppose\nyou thought that Amazon (AMZN)'s earnings were going to be strong so you bought a call for $5.00 on the day before, and the earnings were strong\nand AMZN went up 5 percent on the open; however, your call might open at only $4.00. You would be right about the strong earnings and the strong\nopen, but the premium was so inflated that AMZN probably had to go up 10 percent for your call to increase in value. Because of this rapid loss of\nthe greatly inflated premium, traders need to be careful when buying options before catalysts. If the volatility is too high, they are expensive and\nrequire a huge move to be profitable. One way to reduce the effect is to buy a spread so that your short option's loss of premium will largely offset\nthe loss on your long option, but spreads are usually worth buying only if you plan to hold the position for a week or more, because they usually will\nbe profitable only if there is a big move, or if there is a smaller move and expiration is approaching.\nMany index options traders pay attention to the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), which tends to move in the\nopposite direction to the indexes and in general rises greatly when the market falls in a panic and traders are buying a huge number of puts to\nhedge their longs. Other traders are obviously buying puts as a bet that the bear trend will continue. However, after the market starts to turn up\nagain, there can also be an increase in put buying, but for a different reason. Instead of speculators betting on a fall or scared longs hedging, it is\noften due to confident longs who are protecting their new longs. When this is the case, that put buying implies that the downside risk is much less.\nThese new longs are willing to hold on to their stock positions during a sell-off because they bought the puts as protection, so if the market falls, they\nwill hold on to their stock and futures positions instead of selling in a panic and driving the market down further. In other words, this put buying is a\nsign that the downside risk has shrunk and bulls are becoming confident. However, it is impossible to know whether the overall put purchases in the\nmarket are for speculation on further declines or for protection of new longs. Relying on the opinions of pundits on television is never a good basis\nfor taking positions. If they could make a lot of money trading, most of them would not be wasting time pontificating on CNBC.\nMany hedge funds buy stock and hedge by also buying puts, either in the specific stocks in their portfolios or in the overall market, like SPY puts.\nHedge funds are rarely perfectly hedged and most adjust the amount of put protection based on the overall market. Some use the volatility index to\nmake adjustments in their puts. For example, if the volatility index rises 20 percent due to a 10 percent drop in the stock market over the past few\nweeks, they will buy back some or all of their puts, because the puts would have served their purpose. They initially bought the puts when the market\nwas higher, as protection against a sell-off in their stock portfolio. If the market sells off and their stocks decrease in value, their puts will increase in\nvalue. They will take profits on their puts and either become less hedged while they wait for the market to rally again, or they will buy new puts to roll\ntheir hedge forward into a further out contract, and usually a lower strike price. If the market rallies strongly and they are relatively less hedged, they\nwill buy more puts to increase their downside protection.\nIf you are trading options on the daily or 60 minute charts and are confident that the move will begin within the next day or two, it is best to just buy\nan option instead of a spread. However, if you think that the move might take a week or more to begin, you can reduce the effect of time decay by\npurchasing a spread. You reduce your total profitability because the value of the short option increases as the market goes your way, but the overall\nrisk/reward ratio improves. In general, choose the strike for the short option near a support or resistance area. For example, if the SPY is at 105\nand has a strong buy signal, but there is resistance around 108, you could buy the one-month-out ATM 105 call and finance it in part by shorting the\nOTM 108 call. The net cost of the long call less the premium you collected on the short call might be about $1.20. Since 108 is resistance and\nresistance acts as a magnet, the market should get drawn to the 108 area. Both calls will increase in value, but the long ATM 105 call will increase\nin value faster and more than make up for the loss on the short 108 call. If the market rallies in a very strong bull spike and you think that it will easily\nbreak through the 108 resistance area, you can buy back the short 108 call for a loss and hold the long 105 call, which has more than enough profit\nto offset the loss on the short call. If the rally to 108 is weak and you think that the market might sell off, you should exit your spread with a profit. It is\n", "text_clean": "you will be certain of your risk if the market goes into a free fall after you are in the market. You could try to limit any potential loss with a stop on your call, but even if the market falls far below your stop without it being filled, at least you know that your risk is not catastrophic even if the stop order was never processed (assuming that your position size was reasonable). How can the market fall through your protective stop and not trigger it?\nThe stop is based on the last trade, and if no trades took place in your particular option, the bid and ask might fall too far below your stop, but your stop would not get filled and your option would be worth much less than you thought. It is important to understand that protective stops in options often offer no protection, and if the market is moving quickly against you, you should try to exit on a limit order as soon as you can.\nYou can also consider day trading SPY options instead of the SPY or the Emini, especially when you are starting out and if you are afraid of a huge loss. For example, if you buy a one-month-out, at-the-money (ATM) call in the SPY, it might cost about $250, which is the most that you could lose even if the SPY falls to zero (obviously this assumes that you bought the call and did not make a mistake, like instead shorting a naked put or call). Even if the SPY fell 1 percent over the next hour, you could probably get out of your call with under a $100 loss. If you bought the call during a pullback in a bull trend, the odds are good that you would be able to exit with a 10 to 20 cent profit, which translates into a $10 to $20 profit. This would require about a 25 to 45 cent move in the SPY. If the SPY instead fell 50 cents, you could get out of your call with maybe a 30 cent loss, which is $30. Buying puts or calls gives beginning traders more certainty about the most they have at risk, and this might make it easier for them to think about how to trade without constantly worrying about the dollars.\nIf you take only a couple of day trades a day in the futures or stock markets, then you can be more active in the options market, especially if you also actively swing trade stocks. The opportunities could fill another book, but a few points are worth making here. For example, if you are long a stock that is basing on the daily chart and you are willing to add on lower, you could sell a put at one strike below the market. You collect the premium if your stock goes up or even drops a little, and if instead it goes down below the strike of the put, the buyer of that put will put the stock to you (you will be forced to buy it at the strike price) and you will therefore be adding to your long stock position at that lower price.\nAnother common use of options for traders who are long stock is to sell out-of-the-money (OTM) calls to collect premium. This covered call writing can add about a 10 percent return to your portfolio every year, but it will occasionally take you out of a stock that is exploding upward.\nIf you are expecting a big move in a stock or a futures contract but you don't know the direction, you can buy a straddle (buy both a put and a call), but then you suffer time decay, commissions, and bid-ask spreads on both legs. Straddles are rarely worthwhile. An alternative for futures traders is to combine the futures and options in a delta-neutral position, meaning that it has an equal chance of going up or down. For example, in the Emini, one long contract is equal to buying 500 SPY or 10 at-the-money calls. If you buy one Emini contract (or 500 SPY) and 10 ATM puts (alternatively, you could short one Emini or 500 SPY and buy 10 ATM calls), this is a delta-neutral position at the moment that you placed the trade. If the market moves up or down, the delta changes. If the market goes up, your Emini will make more than your puts will lose; if the market goes down, your puts will gain more than your Emini will lose. You lose money only if the market goes sideways for several days, because your option will decay. There is a lot of fine-tuning that you can do to increase your return as the market moves, but Emini day traders are too busy to add this to their trading.\nOption traders often talk about catalysts, which are upcoming news events that can lead to big moves in a stock. The most common one is an upcoming earnings report, and less common ones include anticipated information about new products or possible takeovers. Because there is uncertainty and the potential for a big move up or down is large, the premium is usually greatly inflated. As soon as the news is announced, the premium gets crushed, so much so that you can see the big move in the direction that you expected and still lose money! For example, suppose you thought that Amazon (AMZN)'s earnings were going to be strong so you bought a call for $5.00 on the day before, and the earnings were strong and AMZN went up 5 percent on the open; however, your call might open at only $4.00. You would be right about the strong earnings and the strong open, but the premium was so inflated that AMZN probably had to go up 10 percent for your call to increase in value.

Your premise has changed so you need\nto reevaluate your position, and this is always a consideration when trading options. If the SPY is at 108 at expiration, the short 108 call will expire\nworthless and the long 105 call will be worth $3.00, so your total net profit might be about $1.80. However, if the market is at 108 with two weeks to\ngo before expiration and your net open profit is $1.50, it is probably better to simply exit because it is not worth risking turning your $1.50 profit into\na loss by sitting through a sell-off below 105 before expiration. As the market rallied to 108, your risk/reward situation changed, and it is no longer\nas good as it was when you put the trade on. It is better to take your profit and look for the next trade.\nA trader can either buy or sell a spread. For example, if the SPY is at 130 and a trader thinks that it will go up, he could buy a call spread by\nbuying the ATM 130 call and selling an OTM call at a higher strike price, like a 133 call. He could also make a bullish bet by shorting a put spread,\nlike selling an ATM 130 put and buying an OTM 125 put. In general, most traders prefer buying spreads to selling them because they prefer to be\nlong and not short the ATM option. If they are short the ATM option and the underlying goes even a little against them, they are at risk of having\nadditional, unwanted work. For example, if they shorted that put spread and the SPY fell to 129 and stayed there as expiration approached, they\nmight be put the stock, which means that the broker will automatically sell them the stock at 130; then they would have to decide what to do with the\nstock and the remaining long OTM put.\nBuying a spread is usually best when you plan to hold the trade for several weeks, especially if you can hold the position into the final week. This\nis because the short strike is always more OTM; the more a position is OTM, the faster it will lose premium through time decay, and that decay\naccelerates rapidly in the final week. However, you can also purchase a spread with the intention of holding it for just a few days if you are expecting\na huge move beyond your short strike within that time. Buy the spread for a trade that you expect to hold for less than a week only if you think that\nthe market will go beyond your short strike during that week. Otherwise, just buy a simple call or put. For example, say the SPY is at 134 and you\nthink that it will fall to 130 over the next week. Either you could buy a put, like the ATM 134 put, or you might want to consider a spread, like a long\n134 put and a short 132 or 131 put.\nSince options lose money every day even if the market remains unchanged, you should hold your position only if you believe that your premise is\nstill valid. Otherwise, get out, even at a loss. How do you know if your premise is still valid? Look at the market as it is at this moment and imagine\nthat you are not holding the position. Next, ask yourself if you would put on that exact position. If you would not, then your premise is invalid and you\nshould exit immediately.\nA common mistake that a beginner makes is to hold a winning option position too long. For example, if the trader buys a call at the bottom of a\ntrading range with a goal of a test up to the middle of the range over the next week, but the market races to the target in just one day, it is usually\nbetter to take most or all of the profits at that point. Yes, the strong momentum might be the start of a bull trend, but it is more likely that the trading\nrange will continue, and either the market will soon go sideways and erode the premium through time decay or the market will pull back and the\nprofit will disappear. Option profits disappear quickly, so it is very important to take them once you have them.\nJust because a stock is well-known, do not assume that its options are heavily traded. If they are not, the bid-ask spread can be unacceptably\nlarge. For example, the bid for an ATM call might be $1.20 and the ask might be $1.80. This means that you would probably have to pay $1.80 for\nthe call, and if you immediately sold it you would receive $1.20, instantly losing 60 cents, or a third of your investment! In general, if the open interest\nis less than 1,000 or the recent daily volume is less than 300 options for the strike that you are considering, you usually should not place the trade.\nYou should rarely, if ever, trade thinly traded options. However, if you do, you should always enter and exit with limit orders. Even then, your limit\norder might sit there for hours while you are waiting for it to get filled, and you will sometimes end up giving in and exiting at the market, greatly\nreducing your profit potential. One of the nice things about active option markets like the SPY is that the bid-ask spread for the front month is usually\nonly a penny for ATM and near-the-money options, so you can place market orders and get excellent fills.\nA large bid-ask spread alone should not be a deterrent to buying an option, because the spread is proportional to the price of the stock. When\nAAPL is trading at $300, the bid-ask spread on an ATM call might be 20 cents, which might seem like a lot to a beginner. However, traders would\nnot hesitate to buy an option on a stock trading at $30 if the bid-ask spread on the option was 2 cents. They might buy 10 calls of the $30 stock for\nevery one AAPL call. This is a mathematically appropriate way to trade.\nSpreads can be useful if you are entering during a strong spike on the daily chart and the market has a way to go before it reaches its target. For\nexample, if the SPY is at 118 and falling sharply well below the moving average in a new bear trend, and you believe that it will hit 115 within the\nnext few days, you might be hesitant to buy a put, because the market might suddenly reverse up to the moving average before falling to the target.\nAs an alternative, you can buy a 118 put and short a 115 put. If the market falls nonstop over the next couple of days to the 115 support area, you\ncould exit your put spread for maybe a $1.50 profit. If instead it rallied to 120 at the moving average, your spread might have an open loss of a\ndollar. If you believed that your premise was still intact, you could leg out of your spread by buying back your short put for a profit of maybe 50 cents,\nbut holding your long put. If you are right and the market then falls to your 115 target over the next week, you might make an additional $2.00 on the\nlong put for a total profit of about $2.50 on the trade. It takes experience to be able to leg out of a spread when the market is going against you, but\nif you are confident about your chart reading, this can be a good approach.\nIncidentally, short options at support and resistance levels increase the strength of those levels, since options tend to expire near the strike price\nwith the biggest open interest. The more volume traded at any option strike price increases the magnetic effect of that price, which increases the\nsupport and resistance at that price. If the volume is large enough, it can affect the market around expiration. The volume can get huge if there is an\nobvious support or resistance level, because that strike price will generate lots of option activity. In fact, the SPY and the QQQ often expire close to\nthe put and call strike price with the largest open interest. The short side of the options is usually taken by institutions, who are the smart money\ntraders, and they will do whatever they can in the options market and in related markets to make their short options expire worthless so they get to\nkeep the entire premium that they collected.\nThe VIX is a measure of the volatility of the S&P 500 index options, and although buying a call or the SPY or the Emini is usually a good trade\nduring a strong bull spike when you believe that follow-through is likely, there is a risk associated with the VIX. Incidentally, every 16 points in the\nVIX corresponds to a 1 percent expected average daily range in the S&P 500 index (so a VIX of 32 means that the average daily range of the SPY\nand Emini is about 2 percent). If the spike is strong enough, the VIX might also spike up and the cost of your call would be elevated at the time of\nyour purchase. If over the next couple of hours the market enters a quiet bull channel, the VIX might fall enough so that the value of your call will not\nincrease. Because of this, if you want to buy a call during a bull spike or a put during a bear spike, if you are not buying early on in the spike, it is\nbetter to wait for a pullback to reduce the risk of buying during a brief spike up in the VIX, which would cause a brief overpricing of all options.\nA dramatic increase in option volatility usually causes a disproportionate increase in price of the OTM options. This is called skew, and skewed\npricing can be upsetting to beginning spread traders, because it results in smaller profits than what seems fair or logical. If a trader bought a\n133/128 put spread in the SPY during a trading range in a bull market when the SPY was around 133, paying $3.50 for the 133 put and receiving\n$2.00 for the short 128 put, and the SPY fell $4.00 over the next two weeks on some world crisis, the trader might assume that the spread would\n", "text_clean": "usually not worth holding the spread to expiration, even though that it when the maximum profit is realized.

He could also make a bullish bet by shorting a put spread, like selling an ATM 130 put and buying an OTM 125 put.

If they are not, the bid-ask spread can be unacceptably large. For example, the bid for an ATM call might be $1.20 and the ask might be $1.80. This means that you would probably have to pay $1.80 for the call, and if you immediately sold it you would receive $1.20, instantly losing 60 cents, or a third of your investment! In general, if the open interest is less than 1,000 or the recent daily volume is less than 300 options for the strike that you are considering, you usually should not place the trade.\nYou should rarely, if ever, trade thinly traded options. However, if you do, you should always enter and exit with limit orders. Even then, your limit order might sit there for hours while you are waiting for it to get filled, and you will sometimes end up giving in and exiting at the market, greatly reducing your profit potential. One of the nice things about active option markets like the SPY is that the bid-ask spread for the front month is usually only a penny for ATM and near-the-money options, so you can place market orders and get excellent fills.\nA large bid-ask spread alone should not be a deterrent to buying an option, because the spread is proportional to the price of the stock. When AAPL is trading at $300, the bid-ask spread on an ATM call might be 20 cents, which might seem like a lot to a beginner. However, traders would not hesitate to buy an option on a stock trading at $30 if the bid-ask spread on the option was 2 cents. They might buy 10 calls of the $30 stock for every one AAPL call. This is a mathematically appropriate way to trade.\nSpreads can be useful if you are entering during a strong spike on the daily chart and the market has a way to go before it reaches its target. For example, if the SPY is at 118 and falling sharply well below the moving average in a new bear trend, and you believe that it will hit 115 within the next few days, you might be hesitant to buy a put, because the market might suddenly reverse up to the moving average before falling to the target.\nAs an alternative, you can buy a 118 put and short a 115 put. If the market falls nonstop over the next couple of days to the 115 support area, you could exit your put spread for maybe a $1.50 profit. If instead it rallied to 120 at the moving average, your spread might have an open loss of a dollar. If you believed that your premise was still intact, you could leg out of your spread by buying back your short put for a profit of maybe 50 cents, but holding your long put. If you are right and the market then falls to your 115 target over the next week, you might make an additional $2.00 on the long put for a total profit of about $2.50 on the trade. It takes experience to be able to leg out of a spread when the market is going against you, but if you are confident about your chart reading, this can be a good approach.\nIncidentally, short options at support and resistance levels increase the strength of those levels, since options tend to expire near the strike price with the biggest open interest. The more volume traded at any option strike price increases the magnetic effect of that price, which increases the support and resistance at that price. If the volume is large enough, it can affect the market around expiration. The volume can get huge if there is an obvious support or resistance level, because that strike price will generate lots of option activity. In fact, the SPY and the QQQ often expire close to the put and call strike price with the largest open interest. The short side of the options is usually taken by institutions, who are the smart money traders, and they will do whatever they can in the options market and in related markets to make their short options expire worthless so they get to keep the entire premium that they collected.\nThe VIX is a measure of the volatility of the S&P 500 index options, and although buying a call or the SPY or the Emini is usually a good trade during a strong bull spike when you believe that follow-through is likely, there is a risk associated with the VIX. Incidentally, every 16 points in the VIX corresponds to a 1 percent expected average daily range in the S&P 500 index (so a VIX of 32 means that the average daily range of the SPY and Emini is about 2 percent). If the spike is strong enough, the VIX might also spike up and the cost of your call would be elevated at the time of your purchase. If over the next couple of hours the market enters a quiet bull channel, the VIX might fall enough so that the value of your call will not increase. Because of this, if you want to buy a call during a bull spike or a put during a bear spike, if you are not buying early on in the spike, it is better to wait for a pullback to reduce the risk of buying during a brief spike up in the VIX, which would cause a brief overpricing of all options.\nA dramatic increase in option volatility usually causes a disproportionate increase in price of the OTM options. This is called skew, and skewed pricing can be upsetting to beginning spread traders, because it results in smaller profits than what seems fair or logical. If a trader bought a 133/128 put spread in the SPY during a trading range in a bull market when the SPY was around 133, paying $3.50 for the 133 put and receiving $2.00 for the short 128 put, and the SPY fell $4.00 over the next two weeks on some world crisis, the trader might assume that the spread would", "noise_score": 0.98, "is_noise": true, "heading_lines": ["usually not worth holding the spread to expiration, even though that it when the maximum profit is realized.

It was reasonable to buy puts at the end of the day. Since the market was in a broad bear channel\ndown from bar 5, many traders bought puts on each rally above the midpoint of the prior leg down and near the moving average. Many waited until\nnear the close of the day, to be confident that the day would be a bear trend day, like during bars 8, 10, 12, and the bar after bar 14. They took\nprofits below the most recent swing low, and the profit taking by all bears, combined by the buying by the bulls, resulted in the reversal up after each\nnew low. Bears were buying back their shorts at new lows, not pressing their bets by shorting more on the breakout. This is a sign that the bear\ntrend is transitioning into a two-sided market (a trading range).\nFIGURE 23.3 Fade Trading Range Extremes with Options\nWhen the market is in a trading range, traders can buy puts and exit previously purchased calls near the top of the range and then buy calls and exit\nputs near the bottom of the range. As shown in Figure 23.3, after the reversal up from the bar 5 low, Morgan Stanley (MS) reversed down after bar\n9, which was the second attempt to break out above the bar 2 high. Since there was a spike up to bar 6 and then a pullback to bar 7, the three\npushes up to bar 9 (bar 6 was the first push) were likely to function as a channel and be followed by a test of the bar 7 bottom of the channel.\nTraders could have bought puts near the close of the bear bar that formed three bars after bar 9.\nBar 11 was a bull reversal bar and a double bottom bull flag with bar 7, as well as the bottom of a channel after the bear spike to bar 10. Traders\ncould have exited their puts and bought calls going into the close of the bar.\nThe bar after bar 13 had a bear body, and traders could have exited their calls and bought puts at the top of the range, especially since this was\na wedge bear flag. The two bars after bar 10 formed the first push up, and bar 12 was the second.\nThe move down to bar 15 followed a very strong spike, and even though bar 15 formed a double bottom with bar 11, the market might have\nneeded more of a base before it could rally much. Traders who did buy calls here should have taken profits on the reversal at the bar 16 top of the\nwedge bear flag.\nBar 17 was a bull reversal bar and the third push down from the bar 9 high. Many traders saw this as a potential bull triangle after the strong move\nfrom bar 5 to bar 9, and this was a call-buying opportunity. It was also a reversal up from a low 2 at the bottom of a trading range (bars 7, 11, and 15\nestablished the bottom of the range). A low 2 short signal at the bottom of a trading range usually fails and leads to a reversal up, as do most\nattempts to break out of a trading range.\nWhen professional options traders believe that the market will rally, they will sometimes put on a risk reversal, which is beyond the scope of this\nbook. For example, the market rallied strongly from the bar 5 low and then entered a trading range. Many traders would rightfully have concluded\nthat the market had a good chance of testing the top of the trading range again, and it might even break to a new high. After the double bottom at\nbar 15, an options trader saw that there was strong buying around 24.00, and he would be happy to be able to buy there. Since he believed that the\nmarket would work higher, he could have bought a call at any point as the market rallied up from the bar 15 bottom of the triangle (with bars 7 and\n11). If he bought the one month out November 26 OTM call for 1.50, he might have been able to completely cover the cost of that purchase by\nselling an OTM 24 put, which would have given him about a 1.50 credit. The net cost of his long 26 call and his short 24 put was zero, and this\nstrategy is called a risk reversal. If the market fell below 24, the stock would have been put to him at 24, the price where he was hoping to be able to\nbuy. He would then be long the stock and still long a call. If the market fell sharply, he would lose the 1.50 he spent for the call and as many dollars\nas the stock fell below his 24 entry price. However, he believed that this was unlikely, and in this situation, had possibly a 70 percent chance of\nmaking money. The market dipped below 24, and on a one-bar small dip like that with several weeks to expiration, it would have been unlikely that\nhe would have been put the stock. If he had been, then he would be long the stock and the call, and he could have taken profits on both around the\nbar 18 test of the top of the trading range. If he was not put the stock, he could have closed out his risk reversal with a big profit on both his long call\nand his short put, which would have fallen close to zero (he received 1.50 when he sold it and could now buy it back for about 10 cents). A risk\nreversal is similar to holding the belief that the market might form a lower low major trend reversal. The trader believes that the market is reversing\nup and is comfortable buying (being put the stock) if the market falls to a lower low.\nFIGURE 23.4 The SPY Is a Good Market for Options\n", "text_clean": "who correctly assumed that a breakout above bar 4 would be followed by a pullback to below the bar 4 high could have bought puts at the bar 5 doji or before the close of the next day once it was clear that the day was likely to be a strong bear trend day.\nWhen the market turned up at bar 9 and rallied several dollars above the bar 7 low, traders could have bought calls on or just before the close of bar 11, expecting a rally of at least a couple of dollars above the bar 9 low.

Since there was a spike up to bar 6 and then a pullback to bar 7, the three pushes up to bar 9 (bar 6 was the first push) were likely to function as a channel and be followed by a test of the bar 7 bottom of the channel.\nTraders could have bought puts near the close of the bear bar that formed three bars after bar 9.\nBar 11 was a bull reversal bar and a double bottom bull flag with bar 7, as well as the bottom of a channel after the bear spike to bar 10. Traders could have exited their puts and bought calls going into the close of the bar.\nThe bar after bar 13 had a bear body, and traders could have exited their calls and bought puts at the top of the range, especially since this was a wedge bear flag. The two bars after bar 10 formed the first push up, and bar 12 was the second.\nThe move down to bar 15 followed a very strong spike, and even though bar 15 formed a double bottom with bar 11, the market might have needed more of a base before it could rally much. Traders who did buy calls here should have taken profits on the reversal at the bar 16 top of the wedge bear flag.\nBar 17 was a bull reversal bar and the third push down from the bar 9 high. Many traders saw this as a potential bull triangle after the strong move from bar 5 to bar 9, and this was a call-buying opportunity. It was also a reversal up from a low 2 at the bottom of a trading range (bars 7, 11, and 15 established the bottom of the range). A low 2 short signal at the bottom of a trading range usually fails and leads to a reversal up, as do most attempts to break out of a trading range.\nWhen professional options traders believe that the market will rally, they will sometimes put on a risk reversal, which is beyond the scope of this book. For example, the market rallied strongly from the bar 5 low and then entered a trading range. Many traders would rightfully have concluded that the market had a good chance of testing the top of the trading range again, and it might even break to a new high. After the double bottom at bar 15, an options trader saw that there was strong buying around 24.00, and he would be happy to be able to buy there. Since he believed that the market would work higher, he could have bought a call at any point as the market rallied up from the bar 15 bottom of the triangle (with bars 7 and 11). If he bought the one month out November 26 OTM call for 1.50, he might have been able to completely cover the cost of that purchase by selling an OTM 24 put, which would have given him about a 1.50 credit. The net cost of his long 26 call and his short 24 put was zero, and this strategy is called a risk reversal. If the market fell below 24, the stock would have been put to him at 24, the price where he was hoping to be able to buy. He would then be long the stock and still long a call. If the market fell sharply, he would lose the 1.50 he spent for the call and as many dollars as the stock fell below his 24 entry price. However, he believed that this was unlikely, and in this situation, had possibly a 70 percent chance of making money. The market dipped below 24, and on a one-bar small dip like that with several weeks to expiration, it would have been unlikely that he would have been put the stock. If he had been, then he would be long the stock and the call, and he could have taken profits on both around the bar 18 test of the top of the trading range. If he was not put the stock, he could have closed out his risk reversal with a big profit on both his long call and his short put, which would have fallen close to zero (he received 1.50 when he sold it and could now buy it back for about 10 cents). A risk reversal is similar to holding the belief that the market might form a lower low major trend reversal. The trader believes that the market is reversing up and is comfortable buying (being put the stock) if the market falls to a lower low.\nFIGURE 23.4 The SPY Is a Good Market for Options", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["who correctly assumed that a breakout above bar 4 would be followed by a pullback to below the bar 4 high could have bought puts at the bar 5 doji", "or before the close of the next day once it was clear that the day was likely to be a strong bear trend day.", "When the market turned up at bar 9 and rallied several dollars above the bar 7 low, traders could have bought calls on or just before the close of", "bar 11, expecting a rally of at least a couple of dollars above the bar 9 low.

Higher volatility increases option premiums, so put premiums were\ngreatly inflated because the bar was so huge. Traders could have bought a put spread, buying the one-month-out ATM 113 put and shorting a put\nabout four strikes lower. If the short put is too far below, its value is too small to be worth shorting. If the market quickly fell below 109, traders could\nhave exited the spread with a profit. However, if they held and saw the rally to the moving average at bar 7, they could have bought back the short\n109 puts, which would be worth much less, and continued to hold the 113 puts, even though they, too, were worth much less. However, the puts\nwould have quickly increased in value over the next several bars, and traders could then have made a profit on both sides of the spread.

{"book": "REVERSAL", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\reversal3.pdf", "page_index": 183, "text_raw": "CHAPTER 24\nThe Best Trades: Putting It All Together\nThe market is linear—it can only go up or down. When you plot it on a conventional chart with time on the horizontal axis, you add a second\ndimension, but the market itself is only price, which means that it has only one dimension. You can make bull and bear bodies have different colors,\nincorporate volume into the widths of the bodies, or add all kinds of indicators, increasing the number of dimensions, but the market itself is one-\ndimensional. The recurring theme of these books is that the market is basically simple. It moves up or down because it is constantly searching for\nthe best price, which changes constantly because of unending changes in countless fundamentals. The fundamentals are anything that traders feel\nare important, and include data on every stock, the overall market, politics, natural and manmade events from earthquakes to wars, and\ninternational factors. This results in the market always trying to break out from a trading range (its current area of agreement on the value of the\nmarket) into a trend, as it searches for the appropriate instantaneous value for the market. If the breakout is to the upside, the bulls are momentarily\nsuccessfully asserting their opinion that the market is too cheap. If there is instead a downside breakout, then the bears at least briefly are winning\ntheir argument that the market is too expensive. Every breakout attempt is met by traders holding the opposite belief, and they will try to make the\nbreakout fail and the market reverse. This is true on every time frame and on every bar and series of bars. The trading range can be a single bar or\na hundred bars, and the breakout can last one bar or many bars. The key to trading is developing the ability to assess whether the bulls or bears\nare stronger. When a trader believes that the odds favor one side over the other, he has an edge. The “odds” refers to the trader's equation. An\nedge (positive trader's equation) exists if the probability of a trade reaching his profit target before hitting his protective stop is greater than the\nprobability of the market hitting his stop before reaching his target. Having an edge gives him an opportunity to make money by placing a trade.\nEvery type of market does something to make trading difficult. The market is filled with very smart people who are trying as hard to take money\nfrom your account as you are trying to take money from theirs, so nothing is ever easy. This even includes making profits in a strong trend. When the\nmarket is trending strongly with large trend bars, the risk is great because the protective stop often belongs beyond the start of the spike. Also, the\nspike grows quickly, and many traders are so shocked by the size and speed of the breakout that they are unable to quickly reduce their position\nsize and increase their stop size, and instead watch the trend move rapidly as they hope for a pullback. Swing traders are often uncomfortable\nentering on the spike because they prefer trades where the reward is two or more times the size of the risk. They are willing to miss a high-\nprobability trade where the reward is only equal to the size of the risk.\nOnce the trend enters its channel phase, it always looks like it is reversing. For example, in a bull trend, there will be many reversal attempts, but\nalmost all quickly evolve into bull flags. Most bull channels will have weak buy signal bars and the signals will force those bulls who prefer stop\nentries to buy at the top of the weak channel. This is a low-probability long trade, even though the market is continuing up. Swing traders who are\ncomfortable taking low-probability buy setups near the top of weak bull channels love this kind of price action, because they can make many times\nwhat they are risking and this more than makes up for the relatively low probability of success. However, it is difficult for most traders to buy low-\nprobability setups near the top of a weak bull channel. Traders who only want to take high-probability trades often sit back and watch the trend grind\nhigher for many bars, because there may not be a high-probability entry for 20 or more bars. The result is that they see the market going up and\nwant to be long, but miss the entire trend. They only want a high-probability trade, like a high 2 pullback to the moving average. If they do not get an\nacceptable pullback, they will continue to wait and miss the trend. This is acceptable because traders should always stay in their comfort zone. If\nthey are only comfortable taking high-probability stop entries, then they are correct in waiting. The channel will not last forever, and they will soon\nfind acceptable setups. Experienced traders buy on limit orders around and below the lows of prior bars, and they will sometimes take some short\nscalps during the bull channel. Both can be high-probability trades, including the shorts, if there is a strong bear reversal bar at a resistance level,\nand some reason to think that a pullback is imminent.\nOnce the channel phase ends, the market enters a trading range, where there are many strong bull spikes that race to the top and strong bear\nspikes that race to the bottom. Traders often focus on the strong spike and assume that the breakout will succeed. They end up buying high and\nselling low, which is the exact opposite of what profitable traders do. Also, the reversals down from the top and up from the bottom usually have\nweak signal bars, and traders find it hard to take the entries that they have to take if they expect to make money in a trading range. Within a trading\nrange, the probability for most trades hovers around 50 percent, and only occasionally gets to around 60 percent. This means that there are few\nhigh-probability setups. Also, lots of low-probability events happen, like reversals that don't look good but still lead to big swings, and no follow-\nthrough after strong spikes.\nAll of this makes it sound impossible to make money as a trader, but if you go back to each relevant section, you will remember that there are\nprofitable ways to trade the market, no matter how it is behaving. Your edge is always going to be small, but if you are a careful, unemotional, and\nobjective reader of the chart in front of you, and only look to take the best trades, you are in a position to make a living as a trader.\nThere are traders trading for every reason and on all time frames at every second on every chart. What generalities can be made about how\ndiscretionary traders, whether institutional or individual, will trade a bull trend? A bull trend begins with a breakout, which is a spike up, and can\ncontain one or many bull trend bars. If the breakout fails, the market will fall back into the trading range, and traders will fade the breakout (it will be a\nfinal flag reversal) and continue to trade the trading range. When a breakout is strong and successful, most discretionary traders will buy with a\nsense of urgency. They will buy at the market, on small pullbacks, at the close of the bar, and above each prior bar. Once the market transitions into\na channel, they will buy below the low of the prior bar, like below low 1 and low 2 signal bars, expecting reversal attempts to fail (in a trend, most\nreversal attempts fail), and above the high of the prior bar, like above high 1, high 2, and triangle buy setups. They will then buy pullbacks from the\nbreakouts of these small bull flags. They will even buy the first breakout of a bear micro channel in a strong bull trend, knowing that there might not\nbe a breakout pullback setup until after the market has rallied many bars. Early on, when the trend is strong, they will buy on new breakouts above\nprior swing highs, but as the two-sided trading (selling pressure) increases, as seen by more and larger bear trend bars and more bars with tails on\ntheir top, traders will begin to sell above prior swing highs. Most will be selling to take profits on their longs, but as the slope of the channel\nbecomes flatter and the pullbacks become deeper, more traders will start to short above swing highs, looking for scalps. When the two-sided\ntrading increases to the point that the bears are about as strong as the bulls, traders will see the market as having entered a trading range. This\nmeans that they are much less certain that the trend will resume on each rally attempt (they no longer are looking for pullbacks in a strong bull trend,\nwhere the breakout usually quickly tests the old high). They will buy low, sell high, and most will scalp. They will look for high 1 and high 2 buy setups\n", "text_clean": "CHAPTER 24\nThe Best Trades: Putting It All Together The market is linear—it can only go up or down. When you plot it on a conventional chart with time on the horizontal axis, you add a second dimension, but the market itself is only price, which means that it has only one dimension. You can make bull and bear bodies have different colors, incorporate volume into the widths of the bodies, or add all kinds of indicators, increasing the number of dimensions, but the market itself is onedimensional. The recurring theme of these books is that the market is basically simple. It moves up or down because it is constantly searching for the best price, which changes constantly because of unending changes in countless fundamentals. The fundamentals are anything that traders feel are important, and include data on every stock, the overall market, politics, natural and manmade events from earthquakes to wars, and international factors. This results in the market always trying to break out from a trading range (its current area of agreement on the value of the market) into a trend, as it searches for the appropriate instantaneous value for the market. If the breakout is to the upside, the bulls are momentarily successfully asserting their opinion that the market is too cheap. If there is instead a downside breakout, then the bears at least briefly are winning their argument that the market is too expensive. Every breakout attempt is met by traders holding the opposite belief, and they will try to make the breakout fail and the market reverse. This is true on every time frame and on every bar and series of bars. The trading range can be a single bar or a hundred bars, and the breakout can last one bar or many bars. The key to trading is developing the ability to assess whether the bulls or bears are stronger. When a trader believes that the odds favor one side over the other, he has an edge. The “odds” refers to the trader's equation. An edge (positive trader's equation) exists if the probability of a trade reaching his profit target before hitting his protective stop is greater than the probability of the market hitting his stop before reaching his target. Having an edge gives him an opportunity to make money by placing a trade.\nEvery type of market does something to make trading difficult. The market is filled with very smart people who are trying as hard to take money from your account as you are trying to take money from theirs, so nothing is ever easy. This even includes making profits in a strong trend. When the market is trending strongly with large trend bars, the risk is great because the protective stop often belongs beyond the start of the spike. Also, the spike grows quickly, and many traders are so shocked by the size and speed of the breakout that they are unable to quickly reduce their position size and increase their stop size, and instead watch the trend move rapidly as they hope for a pullback. Swing traders are often uncomfortable entering on the spike because they prefer trades where the reward is two or more times the size of the risk. They are willing to miss a highprobability trade where the reward is only equal to the size of the risk.\nOnce the trend enters its channel phase, it always looks like it is reversing. For example, in a bull trend, there will be many reversal attempts, but almost all quickly evolve into bull flags. Most bull channels will have weak buy signal bars and the signals will force those bulls who prefer stop entries to buy at the top of the weak channel. This is a low-probability long trade, even though the market is continuing up. Swing traders who are comfortable taking low-probability buy setups near the top of weak bull channels love this kind of price action, because they can make many times what they are risking and this more than makes up for the relatively low probability of success. However, it is difficult for most traders to buy lowprobability setups near the top of a weak bull channel. Traders who only want to take high-probability trades often sit back and watch the trend grind higher for many bars, because there may not be a high-probability entry for 20 or more bars. The result is that they see the market going up and want to be long, but miss the entire trend. They only want a high-probability trade, like a high 2 pullback to the moving average. If they do not get an acceptable pullback, they will continue to wait and miss the trend. This is acceptable because traders should always stay in their comfort zone. If they are only comfortable taking high-probability stop entries, then they are correct in waiting. The channel will not last forever, and they will soon find acceptable setups. Experienced traders buy on limit orders around and below the lows of prior bars, and they will sometimes take some short scalps during the bull channel. Both can be high-probability trades, including the shorts, if there is a strong bear reversal bar at a resistance level, and some reason to think that a pullback is imminent.\nOnce the channel phase ends, the market enters a trading range, where there are many strong bull spikes that race to the top and strong bear spikes that race to the bottom. Traders often focus on the strong spike and assume that the breakout will succeed. They end up buying high and selling low, which is the exact opposite of what profitable traders do. Also, the reversals down from the top and up from the bottom usually have weak signal bars, and traders find it hard to take the entries that they have to take if they expect to make money in a trading range. Within a trading range, the probability for most trades hovers around 50 percent, and only occasionally gets to around 60 percent. This means that there are few high-probability setups. Also, lots of low-probability events happen, like reversals that don't look good but still lead to big swings, and no followthrough after strong spikes.\nAll of this makes it sound impossible to make money as a trader, but if you go back to each relevant section, you will remember that there are profitable ways to trade the market, no matter how it is behaving. Your edge is always going to be small, but if you are a careful, unemotional, and objective reader of the chart in front of you, and only look to take the best trades, you are in a position to make a living as a trader.\nThere are traders trading for every reason and on all time frames at every second on every chart. What generalities can be made about how discretionary traders, whether institutional or individual, will trade a bull trend? A bull trend begins with a breakout, which is a spike up, and can contain one or many bull trend bars. If the breakout fails, the market will fall back into the trading range, and traders will fade the breakout (it will be a final flag reversal) and continue to trade the trading range. When a breakout is strong and successful, most discretionary traders will buy with a sense of urgency. They will buy at the market, on small pullbacks, at the close of the bar, and above each prior bar. Once the market transitions into a channel, they will buy below the low of the prior bar, like below low 1 and low 2 signal bars, expecting reversal attempts to fail (in a trend, most reversal attempts fail), and above the high of the prior bar, like above high 1, high 2, and triangle buy setups. They will then buy pullbacks from the breakouts of these small bull flags. They will even buy the first breakout of a bear micro channel in a strong bull trend, knowing that there might not be a breakout pullback setup until after the market has rallied many bars. Early on, when the trend is strong, they will buy on new breakouts above prior swing highs, but as the two-sided trading (selling pressure) increases, as seen by more and larger bear trend bars and more bars with tails on their top, traders will begin to sell above prior swing highs.

At first, they will only look for scalps, like pullbacks to the\nmoving average, the bottom of the trading range, or the bottom of the bull channel. Once they see increasing selling pressure, they will begin to\nswing some and eventually all of their shorts, and will only look to buy deep pullbacks, lasting 10 or more bars and having two or more legs. After\nthere has been one or more pullbacks where the selling was strong enough to break below the trend line and below the moving average, some\nbears will look to short the test of the bull trend high, expecting a major trend reversal. They will short a reversal setup at a lower high, a double top,\nor a higher high, even though they realize that the chance of a swing down might be 40 percent or less. As long as the reward is much larger than\nthe risk, they have a positive trader's equation, even though the chance of success is relatively low. Bulls will buy reasonable setups at the bottom of\nthe trading range, like on larger high 2 buy setups, wedge bull flags, higher time frame trend lines, and measured move targets. Traders realize that\na trading range is simply a pullback on a higher time frame chart. When the spike and channel are steep on a 5 minute chart, they together form a\nsimple spike on a higher time frame chart, like a 15 or 60 minute chart. The trading range on the 5 minute chart is usually just a pullback on a 15 or\n60 minute chart. When bulls buy near the bottom of a 5 minute trading range, many will hold for a swing up, a breakout to a new high, and a\nmeasured move up, even though the probability may be less than 50 percent. This relatively low-probability swing long has a positive trader's\nequation because the reward is much larger than the risk.\nWhile in the trading range phase, signals are often unclear, and there is a sense of uncertainty. Most of the signals will be micro double bottoms\nand tops, and small final flag reversals. This is lower probability trading, and traders have to be careful and quick to take profits (scalp). They must\nforce themselves to buy low and sell high, not buy strong bull spikes near the top of the range and short strong bear spikes near the bottom.\nInvariably, the spikes look strong, but don't overlook all of the bars before them—in a trading range, most breakout attempts fail. Once the market\nhas entered a trading range, if a leg is in a strong micro channel, lasting four or more bars, don't enter on the breakout. Wait to see if the breakout\nis strong. If so, enter on the pullback from the breakout. If there is a bear micro channel down to the bottom of the range, wait for the bull breakout\nand look to buy the pullback, whether it forms a higher low, a micro double bottom, or a lower low. If there is a bull micro channel up to the top of the\nrange, wait to sell a lower high, micro double top, or higher high pullback. As with all trades, always make sure that there is an appropriate signal\nbar.\nIf the market enters a tight trading range, wait for the breakout, because tight trading ranges trump everything, including every logical reason to\ntake a trade. Using stop entries in a tight trading range is a losing strategy, but the setups always look worthwhile. Instead, patiently wait for the\nbreakout and then decide if it is likely to succeed or fail.\nIf there is a successful breakout of the top of the entire trading range, the process starts all over again. Traders will see the breakout as a spike\nand they will look for at least a measured move up. If there is an upside breakout, but it fails and the market reverses, traders will view the trading\nrange as the final flag in the bull trend. If there is then a breakout below the trading range, traders will evaluate the strength of the breakout, and if it\nis strong, they will repeat the entire process in the opposite direction. The downside breakout from the trading range can occur without first having a\nfailed upside breakout. Instead of a final flag reversal, the trading range can be some other kind of reversal setup, like a double top, a triple top, a\nhead and shoulders top, or a triangle. All that matters is that there is a strong downside breakout, and traders will then expect pullbacks and a bear\nchannel to follow the bear breakout, and then the market to evolve into a trading range, which can be then followed by a bull or bear breakout.\nExamples of best trades include:\nOpening reversals where the setup is strong:\nSwing for a reward that is at least twice the risk: the probability of success is 50 to 60 percent.\nScalp for a reward that is at least as large as the risk: the probability is about 60 to 70 percent.\nStrong reversals, where the reward is at least twice the risk and the probability is 50 to 60 percent:\nMajor trend reversal: Following a strong break of the trend line, look for a weak trend resumption to fail on a test of the trend's\nextreme; the reversal signal bar should be strong. After a bear trend, look to buy a higher low, double bottom, or lower low.\nAfter a bull trend, look to short a higher high, double top, or lower high.\nStrong final flag reversal after a swing up or down in a trading range or weak channel.\nBuying a third or fourth push down in a bear stairs pattern for a test of the low of the prior push down.\nSelling a third or fourth push up in a bull stairs pattern for a test of the high of the prior push up.\nTrading when the channel in a spike and channel day or the breakout in a trending trading range day reaches a measured\nmove target and the move is weakening.\nBuying a high 2 pullback to the moving average in a bull trend.\nSelling a low 2 pullback to the moving average in a bear trend.\nBuying a wedge bull flag pullback in a bull trend.\nSelling a wedge bear flag pullback in a bear trend.\nBuying a breakout pullback after a breakout from a bull flag in a bull trend.\nSelling a breakout pullback after a breakout from a bear flag in a bear trend.\nBuying a high 1 pullback in a strong bull spike in a bull trend, but not after a strong buy climax.\nSelling a low 1 pullback in a strong bear spike in a bear trend, but not after a strong sell climax.\nShorting at the top of a trading range, especially if it is a second entry.\nBuying at the bottom of a trading range, especially if it is a second entry.\nEntering using limit orders requires more experience reading charts, because the traders are entering in a market that is going in the opposite\ndirection to their trade. Traders should only use limit orders to trade in the direction of the trend. For example, if a trader is thinking about using a\nlimit order to buy at the low of the prior bar, he should only do so if the market is always-in long, or he thinks that it is likely to immediately switch to\nalways-in long. He should never buy with the intention of scalping the long and then shorting once the low 2 sell setup forms if he believes that the\nmarket is still always-in short and is likely to have only one more small push up. The probability of success is simply too low when using limit orders\nto trade countertrend. The low probability results in a losing trader's equation and you will lose money, unless you are an exceptional profitable and\nexperienced scalper. Surprises in trends are usually in the direction of the trend, so when you think that the low 1 in a bear trend is weak and that\nthe market should have one more push up, the odds are too great that it will not. However, experienced traders can reliably use limit or market\norders with these potential best trade setups:\nBuying a bull spike in a strong bull breakout at the market or on a limit order at or below the low of the prior bar (entering in spikes\nrequires a wider stop and the spike happens quickly; this combination is difficult for many traders).\n", "text_clean": "near the top of the range, and will short above the signal bars, instead of buying up there.

If so, you should assume that the probability is at least 60 percent (the directional probability of an equidistant\nmove was discussed in Chapter 25 on mathematics in the second book). With the potential reward at least as large as the risk, this\ncreates a positive trader's equation.\nEnter only on stops.\nAlways have a protective stop in the market, because belief and hope will not protect against a premise that is failing.\nHave a profit-taking limit order in the market so that you will not get greedy and watch your profit disappear as you hope for more.\nBuy only above bull bars and short below bear bars.\nTrade only a small position size. If you think that you can trade 300 shares, you should trade only 100 shares so that you are in “I don't\ncare” mode. This will allow you to be more objective and less easily swayed by emotions.\nLook for only three to five reasonable trades a day. If in doubt, stay out.\nLook for simple strategies. If something is not clear, wait.\nThe best choices for a trader starting out are trends that develop in the opening range, strong trend reversals, and pullbacks in strong\ntrends.\nMost traders starting out will experiment with scalping for a profit target that is about as large as the risk, or swinging for a target that is at least\ntwice as large as the risk, or a combination of the two, because they want to see if they can be successful and if one style better suits their\npersonalities. There is no one right way, since all three have positive trader's equations when traded properly. The single best trade is a high-\nprobability swing, because it gives traders flexibility, creating a bigger margin for error. The high probability allows scalpers to take partial or full\nprofits and enables swing traders to make larger profits, giving all traders a good chance of making money, even if they take profits too early or too\nlate. There are usually two or three a day. Most are either always-in reversals or pullbacks in strong trends.\nIf you are willing to take low-probability trades where the reward is at least twice the risk, you need to take every reasonable setup, because the\nmath is against you if you cherry-pick. The trader's equation for these trades is positive for a basket of them, but the odds are that any one trade will\nlose (the probability is less than 50 percent, so most will lose). There will usually be only one or two choices a day where the reward is several times\nas large as the risk, but the signal is not strong (so the probability is low), and if you are patient, you will be able to anticipate them. Remember, the\nprobability is low because the setup looks bad. If the setup is strong, then the probability might be 60 percent or greater. When that is the case,\neach trade has a positive trader's equation and cherry-picking is mathematically acceptable. Until a trader is reasonably successful, when he takes\nreversal trades, he should only trade them if the setups are especially strong (like a 60 percent probability). Every one of these reversals is likely to\nresult in an always-in flip. However, it is important to realize that not all always-in reversals happen as reversals trades. Many often come as strong\nbreakouts that have follow-through.\nThe mathematics of every trade is critical, and not thinking about it is the main reason people lose money. They see a strong bull reversal bar\nand quickly enter one tick above its high, ignoring that it is the fourth large overlapping bar in a tight trading range.

He had a website and claimed that he was a profitable trader, and he might well have\nbeen, but it was not because of this second contract. He was risking to his protective stop, about eight ticks away, on both contracts. That means\nthat he was risking eight ticks to make one tick on his second contract. This requires the market to move three ticks beyond the signal bar before\nhitting his protective stop in 90 percent of his trades just to break even on that second contract. Since it is very unlikely that this happens, then his\nsecond contract is losing money on average, even if it makes money on it 80 percent of the time! He might make enough on his first contract to\nmore than overcome his losing strategy on the second contract, resulting in him being profitable at the end of the month, but he would be more so if\nhe understood the math. If a trader has any strategy, he has to consider the math. If the market is moving too fast for a trader to consider the math of\nthe current setup, he should not take the trade. Instead, he should wait to enter later, and only if he can convince himself that his strategy has a\npositive trader's equation.\nAny kind of trade can be a best trade in the right circumstances, and some of the best traders have personal preferences. Paul Tudor Jones\nreportedly likes to trade reversals, Richard Dennis was a well-known breakout trader, Paul Rotter is a scalper, John Henry traded a basket of\nmarkets using an always-in approach, and just about all traders like to trade pullbacks. I prefer high-percentage trades, and my most common\ntrades are pullback entries and trading range fades. I especially like breakouts because when they are strong the probability of follow-through is\noften more than 70 percent. I look less often for reversal trades, because most reversal attempts fail, but I will take a strong reversal setup.\nAfter reading three books and 570,000 words, where does a trader begin? Book 1 dealt with trends, which is when the market is largely one-\nsided. Book 2 discussed trading ranges, where the trading is two-sided, and breakouts, which are transitions from trading ranges into trends. Book\n3 has handled reversals, where a trend transitions into an opposite trend, or at least into a trading range. There is far more information than anyone\ncan process all at once, and it is best for traders to pick one or a few approaches starting out. Some trades are illustrated in this chapter, and a\ntrader who is interested in a particular setup can find more information about it in the relevant chapter of the appropriate book. As traders become\nmore skilled and learn more about their personality, they will discover that they are more comfortable and successful with particular patterns and\nmarket conditions. Rather than fighting the market or their emotions, they should try to stay in their comfort zone and not worry about all of the other\ngreat trades that they are missing. If they followed dozens of markets and time frames and tried to catch the hundreds of set-ups that they would see\nevery day, they would still end up trading between five and 20 setups a day and ignoring the rest. Since the 5 minute chart of any major market has\nbetween five and 10 best trades a day, traders stand a better chance of consistently making money in the long term if they just focus on a single\nmarket and time frame, like 5 minutes, work hard to spot those best trades as they are unfolding, and then carefully place their orders and manage\ntheir trades. Then they should gradually increase their volume, which will put them in a great position to make more money than they ever imagined,\nand all from a single chart. Trading is as simple as that; but as simple as it is, it is always extremely difficult to do in real time because it is a zero-\nsum game with edges that are always small, and the competition is the best in the world.\nThe market either is certain that the price is wrong and is moving in a trend in search of an area of agreement (a trading range), or it is in an area\nof agreement, waiting for a disagreement (a breakout) to develop. As a trend progresses, it pauses and breaks out again. At some point, traders\nbelieve that it has gone too far and they start to fade the breakouts, expecting them to fail and a trading range to develop. This creates double tops\nand final bull flags in bull trends and double bottoms and final bear flags in bear trends. The final bull flags are usually high 1 or high 2 setups, or\ntriangles, and the final bear flags are low 1 or low 2 setups, or triangles. With time, disagreement sets in while in the trading range, and the market\nbreaks out again in search of a new area of agreement. The breakout sometimes fails, and the market then searches in the opposite direction in\nthe form of an opposite trend. This same process happens all day long in every market and on every time frame. The math favors the breakout in\nabout half of the cases, and the failed breakout and reversal in the other half. The key to trading is being able to assess if one side has enough of\nan edge to create a positive trader's equation.\nMaking money always has to be a trader's primary objective, and the long, boring stretches, interrupted by brief moments of anxiety and\nuncertainty, are inescapable components of the job. If traders wait several hours and there is no setup, they will tend to become complacent. Once\nthe trade begins to set up, they will sometimes not be mentally ready to take the trade. However, that is a challenge that they must learn to\novercome. They are trading to make money, and they must learn to perform when the time is right. Firefighters wait for days, never knowing when\nthe alarm will sound, but when it does, they have to act immediately and perfectly. They are professionals and get paid to do their job correctly.\nTraders also wait for events that come only occasionally, but they have to learn to be professionals and respond quickly and precisely when the time\ncomes. If they can learn to be comfortable in this environment, they are in a good position to make a living as a trader.\nA friend once told me that he lost money for many years and never made money until he stopped taking countertrend scalps. He now makes over\na million dollars a year. He discovered the importance of taking the best trades, and that made all the difference. Other than when traders are\ntaking a strong reversal setup, they should look to buy only when the market is mostly above the moving average and sell when most of the recent\nbars are below the moving average. If the market seems to be going both above and below, they should wait until it clearly is mostly on one side or\nthe other. They should avoid countertrend scalps (and all scalps where the risk is greater than the potential reward), which always look so good and\nare profitable often enough to make traders believe that they just need more practice, but have a negative trader's equation and will slowly make a\ntrader's account disappear. Countertrend scalps are most tempting in weak channels, where the with-trend setups just don't look strong enough,\nthere are great-looking reversal bars at every new extreme, and traders are becoming anxious because they have not taken a trade in so long. For\nexample, if there is a weak bear channel, there will usually be a bull reversal bar soon after each breakout to a new low. However, they are caused\nby profit-taking bear scalpers who are looking to short again just a few ticks above the high of the bar. An impatient trader who buys above the bull\nreversal bar on a stop will consistently lose money, because he will lose on 70 percent of his trades and his average loss will be larger than his\naverage win. Always patiently wait for with-trend setups, and if there are none that you like, don't trade, and never take a tempting countertrend\nscalp. Once the market has clearly transitioned into a trading range, traders can then trade in both directions. However, most beginners start to\ntrade countertrend while the market is still in a channel, long before it evolves into a trading range. If a trader cannot confidently make the distinction,\nhe should only trade with trend.\nAnother common mistake is to look at 1 minute charts or other smaller time frame charts, like tick and volume charts where there are one or\nmore bars every one or two minutes. The trades are very easy to spot at the end of the day and, because the bars are smaller, the risk is less per\ntrade; but most are hard to trade in real time. The best ones happen fast and are easy to miss, and most traders then end up taking the ones that\naren't very good. The market is always trying to reverse, and reversals occur on the 1 minute chart every three to 10 bars. However, most do not go\nfar enough for a profitable scalp and instead become flags in the larger trend. A trader who just shorted a 1 minute top in a 5 minute bull trend will\ninvariably lose and end up missing the 5 minute buy signal that the failed 1 minute top will create. If your goal is to make money (and that should be\nyour goal), take only the best trades and avoid 1 minute charts. If, however, this is just an exciting hobby for you, remember that hobbies cost money\nand there may be another one out there for you that is just as much fun and much less expensive.\nWhen thinking about taking a trade, a trader has to decide whether to buy or sell, enter on a stop or with a limit order, swing or scalp, trade his\n", "text_clean": "it at a one tick profit, so that it would cover his commissions.

An impatient trader who buys above the bull reversal bar on a stop will consistently lose money, because he will lose on 70 percent of his trades and his average loss will be larger than his average win. Always patiently wait for with-trend setups, and if there are none that you like, don't trade, and never take a tempting countertrend scalp. Once the market has clearly transitioned into a trading range, traders can then trade in both directions. However, most beginners start to trade countertrend while the market is still in a channel, long before it evolves into a trading range. If a trader cannot confidently make the distinction, he should only trade with trend.\nAnother common mistake is to look at 1 minute charts or other smaller time frame charts, like tick and volume charts where there are one or more bars every one or two minutes. The trades are very easy to spot at the end of the day and, because the bars are smaller, the risk is less per trade; but most are hard to trade in real time. The best ones happen fast and are easy to miss, and most traders then end up taking the ones that aren't very good. The market is always trying to reverse, and reversals occur on the 1 minute chart every three to 10 bars. However, most do not go far enough for a profitable scalp and instead become flags in the larger trend. A trader who just shorted a 1 minute top in a 5 minute bull trend will invariably lose and end up missing the 5 minute buy signal that the failed 1 minute top will create. If your goal is to make money (and that should be your goal), take only the best trades and avoid 1 minute charts. If, however, this is just an exciting hobby for you, remember that hobbies cost money and there may be another one out there for you that is just as much fun and much less expensive.\nWhen thinking about taking a trade, a trader has to decide whether to buy or sell, enter on a stop or with a limit order, swing or scalp, trade his", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["it at a one tick profit, so that it would cover his commissions.

This generates far more\ntrader's equations than he could possibly evaluate in the limited time available. Once he makes all of these decisions, he then has to correctly place\nhis orders and manage his trades. This is virtually impossible to do when a trader is starting out, so he should therefore look for ways to reduce the\nnumber of decisions that he has to make.\nMost traders should keep things simple and try to do the same thing on every trade until they are consistently profitable. Stop entries are better\nthan limit entries for a trader starting out. For example, if the market is in a bull trend and he is deciding to either buy on a stop above the high of the\nprior bar or with a limit order at the low of the prior bar, he should choose a stop entry, because the market is going his way when he enters and the\nodds that it will continue are higher. If he buys using a limit order, there is too much risk that the pullback will fall so far that he will get upset and exit\nwith a loss just before the trend resumes. He should also begin by trading the same position size, the same size protective stop, and the same size\nprofit target on every trade. He should either swing or scalp, but always use a profit target that is at least as large as his protective stop. He should\nnot change his plan once he is in the trade, like converting a swing to a scalp, a scalp to a swing, or, worse, a scalp to one that is smaller than the\nsize of his risk. If he finds himself changing his plan after he enters, he should just place his bracket orders, walk away, and come back in an hour. If\nhe is worried about money as soon as he places his trade, he needs to trade a much smaller position size. If he has been trading 500 SPY shares,\nhe should trade only 100, so that he is in “I don't care” mode. It is better for a trader to win on 60 percent of his trades using 100 shares than losing\non 80 percent using 500 shares because of anxiety that prevents him from following his plan. If he is always eager to place trades, but constantly\nwants confirmation, resulting in him only buying at the top of a strong bull spike or selling at the bottom of a strong bear spike just before a reversal,\nthen he needs to work on patience. He should avoid entering on breakouts and only enter on pullbacks. To improve his patience, he could try\nlimiting himself to three trades a day. Once he has taken them, he would have to wait until the next day before placing another trade. It takes a long\ntime to become patient and able to not take trades while watching a lot of great ones go without you. When he has any doubt about a setup, he\nshould assume that the confusion is his radar telling him that the market is in or about to enter a trading range, at which point he should only buy low\nand sell high. A beginner who is looking to take his first trade should consider looking for swing trades either in trends that start in the opening\nrange or in strong trend reversals at any time of the day. The potential reward should be at least twice as large as the risk. Although the forex\nmarket is essentially a 24-hour market and has no real open, it otherwise behaves like stocks and futures and should be traded in the same way. If\na trader picks setups with strong signal bars and where the context is good, especially if it is a second signal, the probability of success is often 60\npercent, creating a strong trader's equation. The trades that do not reach the profit target are either small losses or wins that approximately offset\none another, so the overall risk is acceptable. Traders usually can learn to anticipate a setup many bars before it actually triggers, which enables\nthem to be prepared emotionally when the setup is about to trigger. With experience, they can take more trades every day and begin to look for\nsetups where the probability of success is at least 60 percent and the reward is at least as large as the risk (instead of at least twice as large, as is\nthe case for swing trades). There are usually between five and 10 setups like this every day on a 5 minute chart, and since the reward is relatively\nsmall compared to the risk, these are scalps (a swing has a profit target that is at least twice as large as the risk). A high 2 pullback to the moving\naverage in a bull trend where there is a strong bull signal bar is an example. A low 2 pullback to the moving average in a bear trend where there is a\nbear signal bar is another. After traders gain more experience, they can begin to enter during strong spikes. Consistently profitable traders can add\nany other setup with a positive trader's equation, even if it is not a best trade, including some scalps where the potential reward is less than the risk\nand the probability is 80 percent, and swing setups where the potential reward is much larger than the risk but the probability is only about 40\npercent. They can begin to fade the tops and bottoms of trading ranges (especially on second signals), where they have a reasonable expectation\nthat the always-in trade is about to flip into their direction. Trading breakouts is a good strategy, but is difficult to do for traders starting out, and\nmost traders should instead wait to enter on pullbacks.\nTraders often struggle as they decide what their initial stop should be. If the context is good, then the probability of an equidistant move up in a\nbull (or down in a bear) is 60 percent, as long as the risk is not too big or too small (like using a two-tick stop when the bars are 50 ticks tall). All\ntrades where a trader chooses a risk that is not too big will have a positive trader's equation. If the bars are unusually large, like 50 ticks tall, a\ntrader can use an eight-tick protective stop and reward, or a 19-tick stop and reward, and have a positive trader's equation. It does not matter what\nthe trader chooses, as long as the reward is at least as large as the risk, and the risk is not too big or too small. Most traders instinctively know what\ntoo big is, like having a protective stop that is larger than the tallest bar on the chart, and what too small is, like using a stop that is smaller than\nnormal when the bars are much bigger than normal. Just use something in between, like your usual stop, or 50 to 100 percent larger. Knowing this\ntakes some stress out of the decision making. Just quickly pick a stop size that seems reasonable. If the bars are very large, you can use your\nnormal stop, like maybe eight ticks in the Emini, or one that is two to three times bigger, as long as you use a reward that is at least as big.\nAny trade with a positive trader's equation is a mathematically sound trade. For example, if a trader has a 50 percent chance of making $2.00 in\nAAPL before losing $1.00, the trade has a positive trader's equation and is a good trade. If the trader has a 60 percent chance of making $1.00\nbefore losing $1.00, or a 40 percent chance of making $3.00 before losing $1.00, it also is a good trade. These are all trades that experienced\ntraders take every day and make consistent profits by doing so. Among the good trades, there are trades that are especially good because the\nsetup is unusually strong due to a confluence of supporting factors and a strong signal bar, and because the trader's equation is very positive. The\nvery best trades have either a 60 to 70 percent chance of making a reward that is at least as large as the risk or a 50 to 60 percent chance of\nmaking two or more times the risk. These are the trades that beginners should primarily take, because trading is difficult and these trades have the\nbiggest margin for error and offer the best chance of generating profits. For example, suppose there is a bull trend that has a strong sell-off to well\nbelow the moving average, then a wedge-shaped rally to a marginal higher high; the rally has several prominent bear bodies in it, indicating strong\nselling pressure, and there is a strong bear reversal bar that pokes above a longer-term bear trend line. Traders shorting below that bear reversal\nbar probably have about a 70 percent chance of making two to four times their risk. A strong reversal setup comparable to this forms several times\na week in every major market, and there are reversals almost every day that are almost as good.\nA trend reversal can be trickier for beginners because most reversals fail, and beginners tend to be overly eager and enter on weak setups. For\na major trend reversal, there has to be a strong break of a major trend line, with the first reversal leg showing a lot of momentum and having a\nstrong reversal bar. Smart traders will then wait for a test of the trend's extreme and enter on a successful test (a lower high, double top, or higher\nhigh in a market top, or a higher low, double bottom, or lower low in a market bottom). They want the signal bar to be a strong reversal bar. If the\nsetup does not have every one of these components, they should not take the trade. The stop management is the same as for the trend trades\ndescribed earlier. A major reversal has a potential reward that is many times as large as the risk. Those with a chance of success of better than 60\npercent form only a few times a week, but other best trade reversals where the probability is 50 to 60 percent and the reward is at least twice the\nrisk occur just about every day in every market. There will usually be a pullback before the target is hit, and many traders have a hard time holding\non to a trade that had a scalper's profit and now is back to their entry price. However, if the original premise is still valid, that is the better choice.\nThere are also strong setups in the opening range on most days. For example, if the market gaps up on the open, rallies for a few bars, pulls\nback to the moving average, forms a double bottom with the first bar of the day, and has a strong bull reversal bar, there is probably at least a 60\n", "text_clean": "usual position size or smaller, and use his usual protective stops and profit targets or ones that are larger or smaller.

There is a\nreasonable swing setup that begins during the opening range on more than 80 percent of the days. A trader will often have to take several signals\nbefore one finally evolves into a trend, but the trades that do not are usually small profits and losses that offset each other. Most reversals in the\nopening range have only a 30 percent chance of generating a reward that is two or more times greater than the risk. However, there is usually at\nleast one where the probability is about 60 percent, and traders should work hard to learn to spot that best setup. When they find one, they have to\nhold through pullbacks, since reversals are common in the opening range, even after a strong signal triggers. It sometimes takes a while before the\ntrend breaks out. Alternatively, they can trade all of the reasonable reversal setups and scalp for a reward that is at least as large as the risk. Even\nthough the probability of making twice as much as the risk may be only 50 percent on a strong setup, the probability of making as much as they are\nrisking is often 60 percent or more, creating a positive trader's equation. The setups were described earlier in this book in Part III on trading the\nopen, and the math is discussed in the second book.\nIf traders are comfortable trading in a fast market and increasing their risk, they can enter with the trend during strong spikes. For example, they\ncould sell the close of the second, third, or fourth bar of a strong bear spike, and use a wide stop to possibly even above the top of the spike.\nHowever, they would rarely have to risk that much. If they used a wide stop, they would have to reduce their position size, but would still have at least\na 60 percent chance of making as many ticks as they had to risk. If the spike was very strong and the context was right, they might be able to risk\nless than half of the height of the spike and still have a 70 percent chance of making at least twice as much as they had to risk. The difficulty is that\nthe spike happens so quickly that beginners are usually not able to make the adjustments needed in the time that the market is giving them. They\nhave to increase their risk and reward and have to emotionally adjust to a large, fast move, and this is usually more than most beginners can\nprocess. The key to any of these best trades is the ability to recognize them as they are forming, and that takes practice. However, if traders learn\nto recognize just one and carefully wait for it every day, they are putting themselves in a good position to make money.\nAnother example of a best trade occurs after a strong spike ends. For example, say a market just had a four-bar bear spike that broke far below\na trading range where the bars in the spike had small tails and bear bodies of moderate size (not so big as to be climactic), and the market is now\nforming a low 2 pullback to the moving average with a bear reversal bar for the signal bar. This setup has at least a 70 percent chance of making a\nprofit that is at least as large as the risk.\nSome of the best trades are on strong trend days when most of the bars are on one side of the moving average, and there are only a couple of\nmoving average pullbacks during the day. These strongest trend days happen only a couple of times a month, but there are reliable trends almost\nevery day. Entering on those pullbacks, especially if they are high 2, wedge, or triangle buy setups at the moving average in a bull trend, or low 2,\nwedge, or triangle short setups at the moving average in a bear trend, are probably the single most reliable day trades that a trader can make. If\ntraders follow a basket of about five stocks with large volume (over about five million shares traded each day) and an average daily range of two\ndollars or more, then they should be able to make one or two trades every day where they can net about one-third of the average daily range on the\nscalp portion of their trade and usually more on the swing portion, while risking about half of the reward. After entering, they should place a\nprotective stop beyond the signal bar (they rarely will have to risk more than one dollar and usually under 60 cents) until the entry bar closes, and\nthen once there is a trend bar in their direction, they should move the stop to just beyond the entry bar. For example, if the stock has an average\ndaily range of three dollars, once the stock moves about 60 to 80 cents in their direction, they should move the stop to breakeven, or maybe a few\npennies worse. If they bought at $120.10 and the stock hit $120.80, they should move their stop to around $120.07. After they exit half or so of the\ntrade on a limit order at one dollar of profit, they should rely on their breakeven stop. They should trail this protective stop beyond swing lows on the\n5 minute chart, and take a little more off at two dollars’ profit. They should consider letting the final portion run until the stop is hit or a clear and\nstrong opposite signal develops.\nIf buying a pullback in a bull is such a great trade, why is it so challenging to make money as a trader? It is because there are problems with every\nsetup, and it is often difficult to believe that a setup is really as good as it is until a bar or two after it triggers and you are on the sidelines, watching\nregretfully. Every pullback starts as a reversal, and when it is time to buy that bull flag, you might still be haunted by that bear reversal and be too\nafraid to buy. Sometimes as a trend is starting out, it is still within a larger trading range. Since it is best to buy low and sell high in a trading range,\ntraders will hesitate to buy a high 2 at the top of a bull leg because it is at the top of a trading range and has not yet broken out. However, if the\noverall context is good and the rally and setup are strong, it is the right thing to do. Similarly, shorting a low 2 at the bottom of a trading range is the\ncorrect trade when the market is likely beginning a bear trend. If traders are not certain, they should wait until they are more confident, but as long as\nthey believe that the trader's equation is strongly in their favor, they must learn to take the trade. Yes, they will often lose, but the math is on their\nside. Remember, a great baseball hitter fails 70 percent of the time, but still makes millions of dollars from that other 30 percent. An experienced\ntrader can win 60 percent or more of the time and have an average win that is larger than the risk, and sometimes two or more times larger. Be\npatient, but when the setup that you have waited for finally arrives, learn to take the trade and trust the math.\nThe sine qua non of trading pullbacks is that the trader believes that the chart is in a strong trend or swing. Since most traders will not recognize\nthat a day is trending on a 5 minute chart until after the first hour or two, these trades will usually not be in the first hour. The easiest setup to\nrecognize is a two-legged pullback to the moving average. The pullback to the moving average usually looks like it could never lead to much of a\nwith-trend move, but invariably the move will take out the old trend extreme and run much further than you would ever imagine. It is important to\nswing part of every with-trend entry on a strong trend day, even though that means that sometimes your breakeven stop will be hit on the swing\nportion of your trade. However, the big runs will more than make up for this. At every new setup, you can either simply add back your scalp portion\nor instead place a full position on top of your current open swing position. Once you scalp out of part, your swing portion is then twice the size of\nyour normal swing (or three or four times, if you keep adding on at every new signal). Most traders would find it easier just to add their scalp\ncontracts back or to simply stick with their original position and scale out at different profit levels. Otherwise, you will end up with too many contracts\nto be comfortable, and discomfort makes it hard to follow your rules.\nThe market has inertia, and as such, when it is trending, about 80 percent of attempted trend reversals fail to reverse the trend and become flags\n(continuation patterns). Remember, a pullback in a trend is a failed attempt at a trend reversal. Therefore, trading pullbacks is a reliable approach\nto trading, and it is the approach used most by the majority of successful traders. Some pullbacks are large and extend for a couple of days and the\nentry can appear to be a reversal entry, but if you look at a higher time frame chart or if you compress the bars on your current chart to see more\ndays, you will see that it is just a pullback.\nWithout exception, all strong trends eventually have larger pullbacks that evolve into trading ranges. Many traders wait for the pullback to become\na clear trading range before beginning to trade the market as a trading range. If traders are particularly good at reading price action, they will\nsometimes begin at the earliest stage of trading range formation, which is at the end of the most recent trend leg. For example, they could short a\nminor new high in a weak bull channel that has been accumulating a lot of selling pressure, where the market is also at one or more resistance\nareas, like a measured move target.

There is a reasonable swing setup that begins during the opening range on more than 80 percent of the days. A trader will often have to take several signals before one finally evolves into a trend, but the trades that do not are usually small profits and losses that offset each other. Most reversals in the opening range have only a 30 percent chance of generating a reward that is two or more times greater than the risk. However, there is usually at least one where the probability is about 60 percent, and traders should work hard to learn to spot that best setup. When they find one, they have to hold through pullbacks, since reversals are common in the opening range, even after a strong signal triggers. It sometimes takes a while before the trend breaks out. Alternatively, they can trade all of the reasonable reversal setups and scalp for a reward that is at least as large as the risk. Even though the probability of making twice as much as the risk may be only 50 percent on a strong setup, the probability of making as much as they are risking is often 60 percent or more, creating a positive trader's equation. The setups were described earlier in this book in Part III on trading the open, and the math is discussed in the second book.\nIf traders are comfortable trading in a fast market and increasing their risk, they can enter with the trend during strong spikes. For example, they could sell the close of the second, third, or fourth bar of a strong bear spike, and use a wide stop to possibly even above the top of the spike.\nHowever, they would rarely have to risk that much. If they used a wide stop, they would have to reduce their position size, but would still have at least a 60 percent chance of making as many ticks as they had to risk. If the spike was very strong and the context was right, they might be able to risk less than half of the height of the spike and still have a 70 percent chance of making at least twice as much as they had to risk. The difficulty is that the spike happens so quickly that beginners are usually not able to make the adjustments needed in the time that the market is giving them. They have to increase their risk and reward and have to emotionally adjust to a large, fast move, and this is usually more than most beginners can process.

Trading range traders are scalpers, and in the Emini, when the average daily range has been about 10 to 15 points, they are looking for two\nto three points of profit. Trend reversal traders are looking for a large correction, or even a reversal into a bear trend, and are planning to swing their\ntrade for at least four points in the Eminis.\nIf the chart starts near the lower left-hand corner and ends near the upper right-hand corner and there have not been any bear legs that have\ndropped below the midpoint of the screen, or if there have been a number of swings with lots of bull trend bars and only small pullbacks, traders\nshould buy every high 2 where the setup bar touches or penetrates the moving average, especially if the signal bar has a bull close above the\nmoving average. Once long and once the entry bar closes, if the entry bar is a strong bull trend bar, they should move the stop from one tick below\nthe signal bar to one tick below the entry bar.

Add on at every new opportunity. Most markets are in a strong\ntrend maybe 20 percent of the time or less.\nWhen the market is clearly bullish, buying near the high (buying a pullback near the high) and exiting higher is an effective strategy, since the\nmarket often goes a long way before there is much of a pullback. When it is in a trading range, buying near the high is usually a mistake, and\ntraders should instead try to buy near the low. When traders cannot tell if the market is in a trend or in a trading range, they should look to enter on\npullbacks from strong spikes, which is an approach that works well in both trends and trading ranges and is why it is the best approach for most\ntraders. If the market is forming a bull flag after a rally, look to buy. If it is forming a bear flag after a sell-off, look to sell.\nIt is natural to get confident after some success, and most traders will start looking to add more setups to their arsenal. Also, they hate sitting for\nan hour or two waiting for the best setups when they see lots of profitable scalps unfolding in front of them. The absolute worst thing to do is to start\ntrading in tight trading ranges. These often occur in the middle of the day after you have been watching for an entry for a couple of hours. They are\nusually in the middle of the range near a relatively flat moving average, and they always look so simple. However, they will damage your account\nand your psyche. Unfortunately, everyone thinks that they can figure them out, and they trade them and wonder at the end of the month why they are\ndown a couple of thousand dollars.\nNotice how buying bull breakouts of trading ranges on stops and shorting bear breakouts of trading ranges on stops are not in the list of best\ntrades. In fact, the exact opposites are there. Beginners should not use stops to enter on a breakout of a trading range, since most breakout\nattempts fail, no matter how good they look. Remember from book 2 that a trading range will regularly have a strong bull spike that races up to the\ntop and looks certain to break out, or a strong bear spike at the bottom that appears to be the start of a strong downside breakout, but both fail and\nsoon reverse. In a trading range, look to buy low and sell high, not buy high and hope for higher, or sell low and hope for lower. If beginners want to\ntrade a breakout, they should wait until after there is a clear and strong breakout and then look to enter on pullbacks. With experience, they can\nenter on the closes of the bars in the spike and before the close, as the spike is growing.\nSelling at the top of a trading range and buying at the bottom of a trading range is a reasonable approach, especially when a trader is entering\non a second signal. This is a more difficult trade for beginners because it appears to be going against a trend. The market usually races to the top\nand to the bottom of trading ranges, giving the appearance of an impending breakout, but most fail. It is particularly good when the setup follows a\nstrong move in this direction. For example, if there was a strong bull spike to the top of the trading range and the market then forms a low-\nmomentum wedge bull flag to the bottom third of the range, buying a strong reversal up or buying a breakout pullback from the bull flag is usually a\ngood trade. Uncertainty, which means relatively low probability, is the hallmark of a trading range. The market spends most of its time in the middle\nof the range where the probability of most trades is about 50 percent, and when it is at the top or bottom, it usually gets there in a strong spike that\nlooks certain to lead to a successful breakout. Experienced traders understand that the spikes are simply tests and that 80 percent fail, and even\nthough each leg is strong, the probability is 60 to 80 percent that the market will soon reverse and test the opposite end of the range. The difficulty\nthat these setups pose for beginners is that the bull spikes to the top and the bear spikes to the bottom look so strong that it is hard to imagine that\nthey could fail. But almost all do, and that strong momentum traps traders into the wrong direction and out of taking trades in the right direction.\nRemember, there is something difficult about every trade, but traders who understand the difficulty can see the opportunity that it presents.\nWhen the market is not clearly trending, look to short a low 2 on a rally to around the level of the prior swing high, and buy a high 2 near the prior\nswing low (buy low and sell high). These days will have several swings lasting five to 10 or more bars and then the trend line breaks, leading to an\nopposite swing. If the momentum on the move to the prior extreme was strong, wait for a second entry, which usually comes within five bars or so.\nAmong the best trade setups, beginners should focus on entries that use stops so that the market is going in their direction when they enter. Also,\nthey should only buy above a bull signal bar and sell below a bear signal bar. How do you know if a trade has a 60 percent probability of success? If\nyou believe that the setup looks good and has a good chance of working, you should assume you could not have that belief unless the probability is\nat least 60 percent. When you feel especially confident about a setup, then you can use 70 percent for the probability in the trader's equation. Any\ntrade in the three books can be a best trade if the circumstances are right, but many setups should be traded only by traders who are consistently\nprofitable and very experienced in reading charts. Most traders should stick to the best trade setups. Remember, a 60 percent chance of success\nmeans a 40 percent chance of failure, and someone shooting at you with only a 40 percent chance of hitting you is still a source of great danger.\nAlways recognize that the 40 percent is very real and dangerous, and always use a protective stop.\nA best trade setup that has a 50 to 60 percent chance of success and a reward that is twice the risk happens in most markets at least once a\nday. Another good option is to take a trade where the chance of success is 60 to 70 percent and the reward is about the same as the risk. On the 5\nminute Emini chart, there are usually several of these on most days, but most traders have a difficult time convincing themselves that the probability\nof success is 60 percent; therefore these trades are for more experienced traders. Also, there are usually just a few strong setups a day, so traders\nwill not feel the constant pressure to make decisions that they would if they were trying to place 15 or more trades a day. This gives them a better\nchance of being objective and of reading the price action to the best of their ability.\nTraders need to find a style of trading that is compatible with their personality, because if they plan to trade for a living, they need to be\ncomfortable and happy with their job. Because everyone sees a dozen or more trades on a printout of the chart at the end of the day, there is a\ntendency to think that scalping is a great strategy. However, very few traders can take all of those trades in real time, and the best ones often\nhappen too quickly to catch. Traders are then left with taking the easy ones, and so many fail that they lose money. This makes scalping for a\nreward that is less than the risk a bad strategy for virtually all traders. One of the great problems with scalping is that it is fairly easy to win on 60\npercent of trades. This gives traders hope that they are very close to making a fortune. However, they actually have to win on about 80 percent of\ntheir tiny scalps to make a living at it, and as close as they think they are to that winning percentage, they will never get there. Another problem with\nsmall scalps is that beginners will often be wrong about what they think is an 80 percent setup. Many of their trades will actually be only 60 percent\ncertain at best, although they seemed much more certain at the time that they took them. Beginning traders will probably think that they just need a\nlittle more experience to increase their winning percentage to 80 percent, where they know that the math would then be on their side. The reality is\nthat they will never become that good because very few of even the best traders ever get there. That is the simple truth. Also, they will never become\n", "text_clean": "range.

For example, if there was a strong bull spike to the top of the trading range and the market then forms a lowmomentum wedge bull flag to the bottom third of the range, buying a strong reversal up or buying a breakout pullback from the bull flag is usually a good trade. Uncertainty, which means relatively low probability, is the hallmark of a trading range. The market spends most of its time in the middle of the range where the probability of most trades is about 50 percent, and when it is at the top or bottom, it usually gets there in a strong spike that looks certain to lead to a successful breakout. Experienced traders understand that the spikes are simply tests and that 80 percent fail, and even though each leg is strong, the probability is 60 to 80 percent that the market will soon reverse and test the opposite end of the range. The difficulty that these setups pose for beginners is that the bull spikes to the top and the bear spikes to the bottom look so strong that it is hard to imagine that they could fail. But almost all do, and that strong momentum traps traders into the wrong direction and out of taking trades in the right direction.\nRemember, there is something difficult about every trade, but traders who understand the difficulty can see the opportunity that it presents.\nWhen the market is not clearly trending, look to short a low 2 on a rally to around the level of the prior swing high, and buy a high 2 near the prior swing low (buy low and sell high). These days will have several swings lasting five to 10 or more bars and then the trend line breaks, leading to an opposite swing. If the momentum on the move to the prior extreme was strong, wait for a second entry, which usually comes within five bars or so.\nAmong the best trade setups, beginners should focus on entries that use stops so that the market is going in their direction when they enter. Also, they should only buy above a bull signal bar and sell below a bear signal bar. How do you know if a trade has a 60 percent probability of success? If you believe that the setup looks good and has a good chance of working, you should assume you could not have that belief unless the probability is at least 60 percent. When you feel especially confident about a setup, then you can use 70 percent for the probability in the trader's equation. Any trade in the three books can be a best trade if the circumstances are right, but many setups should be traded only by traders who are consistently profitable and very experienced in reading charts. Most traders should stick to the best trade setups. Remember, a 60 percent chance of success means a 40 percent chance of failure, and someone shooting at you with only a 40 percent chance of hitting you is still a source of great danger.\nAlways recognize that the 40 percent is very real and dangerous, and always use a protective stop.\nA best trade setup that has a 50 to 60 percent chance of success and a reward that is twice the risk happens in most markets at least once a day. Another good option is to take a trade where the chance of success is 60 to 70 percent and the reward is about the same as the risk. On the 5 minute Emini chart, there are usually several of these on most days, but most traders have a difficult time convincing themselves that the probability of success is 60 percent; therefore these trades are for more experienced traders. Also, there are usually just a few strong setups a day, so traders will not feel the constant pressure to make decisions that they would if they were trying to place 15 or more trades a day. This gives them a better chance of being objective and of reading the price action to the best of their ability.\nTraders need to find a style of trading that is compatible with their personality, because if they plan to trade for a living, they need to be comfortable and happy with their job. Because everyone sees a dozen or more trades on a printout of the chart at the end of the day, there is a tendency to think that scalping is a great strategy. However, very few traders can take all of those trades in real time, and the best ones often happen too quickly to catch. Traders are then left with taking the easy ones, and so many fail that they lose money. This makes scalping for a reward that is less than the risk a bad strategy for virtually all traders. One of the great problems with scalping is that it is fairly easy to win on 60 percent of trades. This gives traders hope that they are very close to making a fortune. However, they actually have to win on about 80 percent of their tiny scalps to make a living at it, and as close as they think they are to that winning percentage, they will never get there. Another problem with small scalps is that beginners will often be wrong about what they think is an 80 percent setup. Many of their trades will actually be only 60 percent certain at best, although they seemed much more certain at the time that they took them. Beginning traders will probably think that they just need a little more experience to increase their winning percentage to 80 percent, where they know that the math would then be on their side.

The result is that they will win most of the time, but their losses will be larger than their wins\nand their accounts will slowly disappear.\nAt the other extreme from scalping is swing trading for a profit that is at least twice as large as the risk and looking for only one or two good\ntrades a day. Most of these setups are only 40 to 50 percent certain, but that is enough to have a favorable trader's equation. When one looks like it\nhas a 50 to 60 percent chance of success, it is a best trade. On most days, there are usually a couple of setups, but sometimes there are five or\nmore. This is the most reliable strategy, but most traders are uncomfortable sitting in front of a screen for hours at a time, waiting for a great trade to\nset up. Also, since it might set up and trigger in a one- or two-minute window, it is easy to miss it when it happens. Another approach that focuses\non major swings is to try to be always in the market, looking for one to five reversals a day and trying to stay in the market in either direction for the\nentire day. However, most traders need to take breaks during the day and they have a difficult time placing reversal trades. Although they will take\nmany always-in reversal setups, they usually trade each as a swing trade, and focus more on making a profit that is at least as large as the risk,\nrather than on reversing on the next opposite signal. Remember, if a signal is convincing enough to be an always-in reversal setup, it probably has\nat least a 60 percent chance of success, on average. This means that a trader taking these signals and using a profit target that is at least as large\nas the stop has a positive trader's equation.\nThe middle ground is what is probably best for most day traders, and is what most experienced day traders choose. They take about five to 10\ntrades a day and trade only when the reward is at least as large as the risk and the probability is at least 60 percent. Aggressive, experienced\ntraders who are trying to catch these tradable swings look for micro double tops to short and micro double bottoms to buy. They do not think about\nthe actual percentage, and instead simply decide if the trade looks good. If a trader thinks that a setup is strong and will likely yield a reward that is\nat least as large as the risk, then it has a probability of success of at least 60 percent (as explained in Chapter 25 of book 2). This allows the trader\nto have a stop that is the same size as the profit target and still have a favorable trader's equation. Although this is the style that most successful\ntraders adopt, most beginners should instead look for strong swing trades, even though the chance of success is often only 50 to 60 percent. This\nis because when the reward is two or more times the size of the risk, the trader's equation is even stronger, despite the smaller probability of\nsuccess. In the Emini, when the average daily range is about 10 to 15 points, look for trades with a good chance of a four-point (twice the size of\nthe initial risk) or more swing, and exit some or all at four points. With experience, traders can scalp out part for two to four points and then swing\nthe balance. If they focus on these setups, they are giving themselves a reasonable chance to become profitable. If they find that they often exit too\nsoon, they should consider placing one cancels the other (OCO) orders (one to take profit at two to four points, the other to get stopped out with a\nloss of two points or less); they should then walk away and come back in an hour. They might be surprised that they have suddenly become\nsuccessful. Once the trend is established, look for additional entries in the direction of the trend, scalping most for two points while risking about\ntwo points and, if the trend is very strong, swinging some. As simple as this sounds, trading is never easy, because you are competing against very\nsmart people in a zero-sum game, and what looks so obvious at the end of the day is usually not very obvious at all in real time. It takes a long time\nto learn to trade profitably, and even once you do, you have to stay sharp and maintain your discipline every day. It is challenging, but that is part of\nthe appeal. If you become successful, the financial rewards can be huge.\nYou have to consider the trader's equation and take a trade only if you believe that the chance of success times the potential reward is\nsignificantly greater than the chance of failure times the risk. You determine the reward by your profit-taking limit order and you determine the risk by\nwhere you place your stop, although slippage can make the risk worse than what your stop might indicate. The difficult part of the equation is the\nprobability, which can never be known with precision. You usually have very little time to make your determination. Since trading can be easier if you\nhave only two choices, in general, if you are not certain, assume that there is a 50 percent chance that your limit order will be filled before your stop\nis hit. If you are confident about the trade, assume that the odds are 60–40 in your favor, although they are often higher.\nThis math has important implications. For example, say you are trading AAPL on a 5 minute chart and are risking $1.00 to make 50 cents, and\nyour chance of success is 60 percent; if you take this type of trade 10 times, you will probably win six times and make $3.00 and you will lose four\ntimes and lose $4.00, which means that you are losing 10 cents per trade, plus commissions. This is the scalper's dilemma and is the reason that\nyou should avoid scalps where the risk is more than the reward. With experience you might be able to find scalps with an 80 percent chance of\nsuccess and be able to use an 80 cent stop and a 40 cent profit target. If you can, then you will average only 16 cents per trade, which is a weak\nstrategy; however, most traders cannot do that and should restrict themselves to trades in which the reward is at least as large as the risk. For\nexample, if you know that you have to risk $1.00 in an AAPL trade, do not take the trade unless you believe that you have at least a 60 percent\nchance of making $1.00. Whenever you use a swing target, you have to allow for pullbacks, because you will usually need more bars before the\ntarget is reached, and when you are waiting for more bars, the chance of a pullback goes up.\nChannels are hard to trade, and since the market spends most of its time in channels, the market is difficult to trade during most of the bars of the\nday. For example, if a trader is entering on stops, a bull channel is always forcing traders to buy at the top. Just after the bull spike ends and the\nchannel begins, there are often one or more good high 1 or high 2 buy signals. However, later in the channel, if the channel is weak, it is better to\nnot buy above bars. A bull channel is a weak bull trend, especially when the slope is shallow, and the trader's equation is rarely better than marginal\nwhen buying at the top of a weak bull trend. How to trade channels was discussed in the first book. They rarely offer best trades for most traders,\nespecially when the channel is tight. If the channel has broad swings, it will usually create pullbacks that qualify as best trade setups. When it is tight,\nmost traders should wait for the bear breakout of the bull channel, and then assess the strength of the breakout. If the breakout is strong and the\nmarket flips to always-in short, then look for short setups. If the market is in its bear spike phase, the probability of successful shorts during the\nspike is usually 60 percent or better, and these are often best trades. The first pullback after a strong bear spike usually becomes a reliable low 1\nor low 2 short setup, especially if the signal bar is a strong bear bar at the moving average. These, too, are usually best trades. Once the trend\nslows down and enters a bear channel, especially if it is tight and shallow, most traders do not have enough experience to find best trades, and they\nshould wait for the process to reverse, and then look for longs.\nIf you trade a 5 minute chart, there is at least a 90 percent chance that there will be at least one trade every day where the reward can be at least\ntwice the risk and the chance of success is at least 50 percent. These trades are always easy to spot on a printout at the end of the day, but as they\nare happening they rarely look as good as you would like. The key to making money for most traders is to work very hard at spotting those trades\nas they are setting up, and to restrict themselves to only those trades, at least until they are consistently profitable. It can be very difficult to sit for\nseveral hours and not place a trade, but your goal should be to make money. If you are not currently achieving that goal, you should give serious\nthought to reducing the number of trades that you are taking and to just trying for one to three trades a day. Also, those trades should be the very\nbest trades, like a two-legged pullback in a strong trend, a strong opening reversal, a trend reversal after a very strong trend line break, or entering\non a very strong spike. With all swing trades, traders have to sit through pullbacks and not be too eager to stop themselves out.

For example, on the 5 minute\nEmini chart, there are often 15 trades where a stop entry order would result in a two-point profit and another 20 to 30 where a limit order would\nresult in a two-point profit, but the majority of these happen too quickly or are unclear as they are setting up, and most traders cannot expect to\nmake a living by trying to trade all of them. A trader should not try to take 40 trades a day. However, beginners with a little practice usually can find\nthree to five best trades a day. Even then, they do not have to take all of them, and should not worry about missing lots of great swings that they see\nafter the fact. Great traders don't take most of the setups that they see during the day. They understand that it is not the number of trades that\ndetermines profitability. It is simply a matter of taking trades with a positive trader's equation, and you can take few or many.\nOne or more of the setups in this chapter occur every day on the 5 minute Emini chart and on the 5 minute chart of just about every market. If\ntraders have the patience to wait possibly hours for one to develop and they restrict themselves to only the trades in this chapter, they would be very\nsuccessful. However, learning to limit themselves to the very best trades is perhaps the most difficult part of trading. If they are not making money\nyet, it is something that they seriously need to consider trying. One important component to making money is avoiding bad trades that invariably\nerase much more than what a trader has earned from good trades. The single most important trade to avoid until one is a skilled, profitable trader\nis any setup in a tight trading range, especially when it is in the middle of the day's range, near a flat moving average, and the day is not a clear and\nstrong trend day.\nThe first thing that traders should do when trying a new approach is to print out weeks of charts of the time frame and market they plan to trade\nand see if their setups appear to be valid. When they begin to trade, they should trade only one futures contract or 100 shares of stock, no matter\nhow large their account is. If they have some experience and are determined to trade larger size, once they decide how large a position they can\ntrade, they should trade only about a quarter of that size. If they think they can trade 10 Emini contracts, they should trade only two or three. They\nneed to be able to not care about losses so that they can remain objective and continue to trade after a couple of consecutive losses. It is unlikely\nthat they will be able to do that if they are trading their maximum size. Only after consistently making a profit for several weeks to months should they\nbegin to increase their position size. However, most traders take many years to become consistently profitable.\nThe most difficult part of trading is deciding whether a setup is good enough to warrant placing a trade. It is especially difficult to do in real time\nwhen you always feel like you need one more bar to be sure, but once that bar forms, you've missed the best entry. It takes many years of practice\nto be able to look at a chart and instantly see what is happening, and even then nothing is ever perfectly clear. However, some things are easier to\nrecognize than others, and a beginner is wise to focus on just a couple of setups that are easy to anticipate. Fortunately, there are many setups that\nare easy to spot and have excellent odds for success.\nOnce you are consistently netting a couple of points every day in the Emini or 50 cents or a dollar in AAPL, you should focus on increasing your\nvolume rather than adding lots of new setups. These are the very best setups, and if you trade 25 Emini contracts and net just two points a day, you\nwill make $500,000 a year. If you trade 100 contracts and net four points, you will make $4 million a year. Many stocks, like AAPL, GS, RIMM, and\nQQQ, can handle 3,000 or more shares without significant slippage most of the time. If you average 50 cents a day on 3,000 shares of just one\nstock, that is about $300,000 a year.\nOne of the most difficult things for beginners is waiting for hours for a trade to set up, and when it finally does, it is so easy to deny how good it\nreally is. For example, if the market has been trading down for 40 bars, rallies to above the moving average, and then sells off to a lower low but\nforms a strong bull reversal bar, it can be hard to believe that the market might rally for the next 20 bars, but it can. If you cannot pull the trigger,\ngreatly reduce your position size to the point that you really don't care if you lose (the ``I don't care'' size). As a trader, you must take trades if you\nare to make money. Keep the math simple and if you think that a trade will probably work, assume that the probability is 60 percent, although it\nmight actually be 80 percent. Then, as long as your reward is as large as your risk, you will have a positive trader's equation. If you are uncertain,\nassume that the probability is 50 percent, but then use a reward that is at least twice as large as your risk.\nIf a trader looked at all of his trades over the past year, he might find that one particular setup contributed more to his profits than any other. Why\nnot simply wait to trade only that one pattern? In fact, why not wait for only a perfect version of that setup? It is because you might only take one\ntrade a week, and you stand to make far more money by trading as many good setups from reliable patterns that you can find. No one pattern is\nbest. They all can be the best when the conditions are right. As long as a trade has a strong trader's equation, a trader will make more money\ntrading it than by waiting patiently for the absolute perfect trade that might come only once a week. You make money by trading, not by waiting. The\nvery best trade is a swing setup where the probability is at least 60 percent, because you will have a lot of flexibility in how you manage the trade\nand can make money by scalping, swinging, or doing some of both.\nFIGURE 24.1 Best Trades in a Strong Bull Trend\nOnce a trader believes that the market is always-in long, the best trade is almost always buying a pullback, especially near the moving average and\nwhen the signal bar has a bull body.

The four-bar bull\nspike up to bar 6 was further evidence of buying pressure. Bar 7 was a two-bar reversal buy setup because it was a high 2 down from bar 6 and a\ndouble bottom bull flag with bar 5. The bar 7 low was three ticks above the bar 5 low, which was a sign of urgency on the part of the bulls. They were\nso eager to get long that they were afraid that the market might not get all the way to the bottom of bar 5, so they bought several ticks above. This\nwas also a breakout test of the bar 3 high (even though bar 7 fell one tick below the bar 3 high). The four consecutive bull trend bars up from bar 7\nprobably convinced most traders that the market was always-in long, and therefore they were looking to buy pullbacks, especially two-legged\npullbacks to the moving average where the signal bar had a bull body, like at bars 7, 12, 20, 25, and 31. Bar 31 was a larger high 2 since it was the\nbottom of the second leg down from bar 23. Bar 25 signaled the end of the first leg down. By bar 24, the market had entered a tight trading range.\nAt that point, most traders should have either taken any buy signal and been waiting patiently or been waiting with no position. The probability of an\nupside breakout falls to 55 percent or less once a tight trading range forms, even if the trend before it was strong.\nThere are often many ways to interpret a signal, and different traders will see it in different ways. For example, the bar 12 buy signal was a\ntriangle breakout buy setup, where bars 9 and 11 were the first two pushes down. It was also a breakout pullback from the bar 11 two-bar reversal\nhigh 1 (bar 11 was the first of the two bars), which was also a double bottom with bar 9. Some traders saw it as a high 2 at the moving average,\nwhere the bar 11 two-bar reversal was the high 1. Bar 12 was a micro double bottom with the bull trend bar from two bars earlier. Most tradable\nbottoms come from some form of micro double bottom (or a simple double bottom, like the two-bar reversal at bar 7 with bar 5), just as most\ntradable tops come from some form of micro double top, like bar 6 with the bear bar three bars later, the bar 10 final flag and bar 8, the bar 16 final\nflag and bar 14, and the bar 23 double top with bar 22 (and final flag). In a strong bull trend like this, however, most traders should ignore these\ncountertrend scalps and only look to buy.\nNotice how the only bar below the moving average was the first bar of the day, and after the bar 5 bull spike, only two bars were able to close\nbelow the moving average, and they were quickly reversed up on the next bar. This is a sign of strength. At the end of the day, it is easy to see that\nthis was a bull trend day (a trend from the open bull, a spike and channel bull, and a trending trading range bull). This was not so obvious as the day\nwas unfolding because trend days always look like they are setting up reversals. However, each pullback becomes just another bull flag. Traders\nmust constantly look for signs of strength, and if those signs are present, as they were today, they must try very hard to buy pullbacks because these\nare the best trades. The probability of success is 60 percent or higher, and the potential reward is at least as large as the risk. If traders held the\ntrades as swings, the reward ended up being several times as large as the risk.\nThe market probably became always-in long as it traded above the strong bar 5 reversal bar. If a trader bought above bar 5, his initial stop was\nbelow bar 5, giving him a planned risk of 14 ticks. Once the market traded above the strong bar 7 two-bar reversal, he would tighten his stop to one\ntick below the bar 7 low, which was 11 ticks below his entry. At this point, the trader knew that the actual risk to stay in the trade was only 11 ticks.\nSince he thought that the market was always-in long, he believed that the probability of an equidistant move was at least 60 percent. When the\nprobability was 60 percent, the minimum profit that he needed to create a positive trader's equation had to be at least as big as his actual risk of 11\nticks. This means that his strategy would be profitable as long as he took profits at 12 ticks above the bar 5 signal bar high, which meant that the\nrally had to reach at least 13 ticks above bar 5. This happened during bar 10 (it reached 15 ticks above bar 5), and this profit taking was part of the\nreason why bar 10 had a bear body. Many traders would have swung part or all of the trade for a larger profit.\nFIGURE 24.2 Best Trades in the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures\nThe 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures market is one of the best markets for entering on stops when there is a pullback in a clear always-in trend.\nAs shown in Figure 24.2, some traders saw the market as becoming always-in long on the two-bar bull spike that began at bar 1, and others saw it\nas flipping to long on the failed low 2 at bar 4, especially after the four bull trend bars up from bar 2. When the market broke out strongly to the\nupside from bar 4 to bar 5, it was clearly always-in long. At that point, traders were buying pullbacks. Bar 6 was a high 1 long buy setup. Some\ntraders are hesitant to buy high 1 setups because the pullback often grows into a high 2 or a wedge bull flag. If traders do not want to buy the high 1\nsetup and also do not want to risk missing a strong trend, they can put a buy stop above the trend high. Here, as the bar 6 high 1 was setting up,\ncautious bulls could have placed a buy stop at one tick above the bar 5 high. This would have ensured that they would get long if the high 1 at bar 6\nresulted in trend resumption instead of being followed by a more complex pullback.\nBars 9 and 11 were high 2 buy setups. Bar 9 was also a micro double bottom with bar 8, a pullback from the bar 8 high 1 or high 2 (some traders\nsaw the bear bar before bar 7 as a high 1 pullback), and a triangle breakout setup (the three pushes down were the bear bar before bar 7, bar 8,\nand bar 9). Bar 12 was a large bull trend bar with a small tail on top and no tail on the bottom. This indicated that the bulls were strong. Bar 13 was\nthen a reliable breakout pullback buy setup.\nBar 14 was a large bull trend bar after a protracted move and after a small trading range (bar 10 to bar 13), which could have been a final flag.\nAfter a final flag, traders usually wait for at least a 10-bar, two-legged pullback to the moving average before buying again. The move down to bar\n15 formed a wedge bull flag, but since it was a micro channel, most traders saw it as just one leg and were hesitant to buy. Most breakouts above\nbull micro channels are followed by pullbacks, so the strongest bulls waited to see whether the pullback would find support at the moving average or\nthe move below bar 16 would lead to another leg down. The latter was less likely since the bull trend was so strong, the market was just above the\nmoving average, and the market was still always-in long.

Once bar 14 closed, some traders immediately placed limit\norders to short at that closing price. Most of those orders would not have been filled, because the high of the bear bar that followed never went\nabove the close of bar 14.

There is usually less profit remaining, but that is the trade-off for the reduced risk. For\nexample, a trader could have bought at the close of bar 10, but his theoretical protective stop would have been below the bar 8 bottom of the bull\nspike.

Bar 4 was a wedge (with\nbars 1 and 3) lower high, and a second entry for a moving average gap bar short in the bear trend, which at this point had evolved into a trading\nrange (bar 3 was the first bar with a gap above the moving average in the bear trend). Bar 5 was a large bear trend bar that was an outside down\nbar and a failed attempt to form a double bottom, so most traders saw the market as always-in short. Shorting below the bar 7 low 1 setup and\nbelow the bar 9 double top bear flag (double top with bar 7), which was also a breakout pullback short from the breakout below the bar 7 bear flag,\nwere both reasonable trades. The reversal up at the bar 10 two-bar reversal was an example of a setup with about a 60 percent chance of making\na swing profit, and therefore was a great setup for all traders, including beginners. Bar 4 was a gap bar in a bear trend, and that often leads to a\ntest of the bear low (bar 2, as this point) and then a rally that has about ten bars and two legs as minimum objectives. The bear spike down to bar 6\nwas too strong for traders to buy. Bar 8 was a reasonable buy, since it was a second reversal attempt from the breakout below bar 2, an expanding\ntriangle bottom (the third bar of the day was the first push down and bar 2 was the second), a final flag reversal from the bar 7 bear flag, and a\nstrong bull reversal bar. Expanding triangle bottoms are always major trend reversal setups. However, since the legs up to bar 4 and down to bar 6\nwere so large, most traders would not call this a major trend reversal and instead would refer to it in other terms (although it was almost certainly a\ngreat looking major trend reversal on the 15 minute chart). Bar 10 was the second entry in an already strong pattern. Traders bought above the bar\n10 high, which was the second bar of the two-bar reversal, and their initial protective stop was below its low. They took partial or full profits once the\nmarket reached twice the risk, and let the remainder of their position swing up, trailing stops below the most recent higher low. Some would have\nexited below the bar 19 double top (with bar 4), and wedge (bars 12, 14, and 19, and bars 14, 16, and 19), and others would have held, keeping\ntheir stops below bar 17.\nThe market was clearly always-in long by bar 12, and traders expected at least one more leg up and possibly a measured move up based on the\nheight of the strong bull spike from bar 10 to bar 12. Bulls could have bought either the bar 13 high 1 or the breakout above bar 12.\nBar 15 was another high 1, but at this point the bull spike was not as strong, since it already had one high 1 buy setup, and the market was\npotentially near the top of a trading range. Bar 17 was a safer buy setup since it was a high 2 at the moving average and the signal bar was a\nstrong bull trend bar (a two-bar reversal with the bar before it).\nThe pullback to the moving average at bar 22 was a bear micro channel, so the first breakout above the channel was likely to have a breakout\npullback before the market rallied very far. Bar 25 was the breakout pullback buy setup.\nBar 25 was a two-bar reversal, and it formed a double bottom with bar 23. Some traders might call it a micro double bottom, since it included\nonly four or five bars. It was also a pullback from the bar 24 breakout of the bear micro channel from bar 19 to bar 23, and an approximate double\nbottom with bar 17, and the first moving average gap bar in the larger bull trend, which is often a buy signal. Since the channel down was tight,\nwaiting for the second entry above the bar 25 two-bar reversal was a higher-probability approach.\nThe bull spike up to bar 26 was made of three consecutive strong bull trend bars, so higher prices were likely to follow. The worst-case protective\nstop on any long was below the bar 25 bottom of the spike, but most traders would have exited sooner, like below the bar 26 low or the bar 25\n", "text_clean": "breakout pullback, it was at the moving average, it had a bull signal bar, it formed a micro double bottom with the bull bar two bars earlier, and it was a 20 gap bar buy setup.\nExperienced traders saw bar 14 as the second, third, or fourth buy climax and expected a trading range to follow.

As shown in\nFigure 24.11, the best trade setups on this daily chart of Tata Motors Ltd (TTM), the carmaker in India, were the bar 3 and bar 4 high 2 setups, any\nof the three bars in the bull spike from bar 5 to bar 6, the bar 10 high 2, the 11 wedge bull flag, the high 1 after the bar 12 breakout, the bar 14\nbreakout pullback and the high 2 entry on the bar before it, the bar 16 high 2, and the bar 20 higher high reversal.\nA wedge bull flag pullback to the moving average in a strong trend is a reliable buy setup. TTM was in a strong bull trend from bar 1 and rose\nalmost 40 percent in less than two months to bar 8. The market had a high 2 pullback to the moving average at bar 10, which was a reasonable\nbuy, and it evolved into a wedge bull flag buy setup at the bar 11 inside bar, also at the moving average. Bar 11 was a pullback from the breakout of\nthe bull flag that ended at bar 10, and it was therefore also a breakout pullback buy setup. If traders bought above bar 10, they could have exited at\nbreakeven on the sell-off three bars later, or they could have relied on their protective stop below the signal bar, which would not have been hit. They\ncould also have placed their stop a little below the bar 7 low.\nBar 7 was the first pullback in a strong bull spike in a bull trend, and it did not follow a buy climax. This was an ideal high 1 long buy setup, which\nwas also a micro channel failed breakout buy setup. It was a breakout pullback buy setup, since it was the first pullback after the breakout above the\ntight trading range that ended with the bar 5 breakout.\nThe huge bull trend bar at bar 17 was a buy climax.

This was a large bear trend bar that closed on its low and formed a large two-bar reversal with bar 20. The size\nof the bear body and the tiny tails indicated that the selling was very strong.\nFIGURE 24.12 Best Trades in SOLF\nAs shown in Figure 24.12, the best trade setups on the daily chart of Solarfun Power Holdings Company Ltd (SOLF), the Chinese manufacturer of\nphotoelectric cells that are used in solar panels, include the bar 4 high 2 at the moving average, the bar 5 huge reversal down from the third push\nup, the bar 7 low 2 after two strong pushes down, the bar 8 double bottom bull flag, the small high 2 after bar 9 and again after bar 10, the bar 12\nhigher high, and the bar 14 two-legged lower high.\nA higher high reversal is usually followed by a lower high short setup. SOLF had a strong move down from the bar 5 high. There was a second\nlarge bear trend bar just before bar 6 and several other bear trend bars around bars 3 and 4. These represented selling pressure, which is\ncumulative and at some point can lead to a trend reversal. However, the bears were unable to string together consecutive bear trend bars after the\ntrend line break, so the always-in position was still long.\nThe sell-off to bar 8 strongly broke the bull trend line, but the sharp rally to bar 9 broke above the bar 7 right shoulder of the head and shoulders\ntop and was therefore likely to have follow-through. After the spike up to bar 9, the market had a channel up to bar 12, which formed a higher high\nabove bar 12. After strong selling down from bar 5, bears were looking to short and bulls were looking to take profits. Some traders saw bar 12 as\nthe third push up in the channel where either bar 9 or bar 10 formed the first push and either bar 10 or bar 11 formed the second push. The bar 12\nsignal bar was a doji, so some traders may have waited for more bear strength to appear.\nThe strong bear trend bar after bar 12 was a sign of strong selling and gave the bears the confidence to sell aggressively on the next couple of\nbars. This three-bar bear spike was made of bars with large bear bodies, and the spike broke the bull trend line. Traders believed that more selling\nwas likely, and since the market was now always-in short, they were looking to short rallies.\nThe market formed a two-legged lower high at bar 14 that tested the bar 12 low, and the market sold off from the first tick of the bar. Traders\nwere very confident that the market was going down. Some traders shorted as the market went below the low of the bar before it and became an\noutside down bar, while other traders shorted the breakout below the bar 13 spike, expecting at least a measured move down.\nThe bear spike down to bar 15 was also strong, but some shorts were trapped out by the sharp rally to bar 18, just above the bar 16 high. Some\ntraders bought above the bar 15 bull trend bar because it was a double bottom bull flag with bar 8, a two-bar reversal, and a one-bar final flag\nreversal from two bars earlier. However, the bears returned on the bar after bar 18, which had a large bear body. It is easy to get trapped out of a\ngreat trade, but it is important to try hard to avoid getting trapped out. Do not tighten your stops too early, and try to hold some of your position with\na breakeven stop until the market clearly becomes always-in long. The rally to bar 18 was not enough to flip the always-in position, so swing traders\nshould have stayed short.\nThe sell-off from bar 5 to bar 8 was strong enough to make traders wonder if the market was evolving from a bull trend into a trading range. The\nrally to bar 12 had many pullbacks, bear bodies, and bars with tails on the top, which are signs of selling pressure, indicating a change into a two-\nsided market. This looked more like a bull leg in a trading range than a bull trend. Traders were beginning to sell above swing highs, like when bar\n10 moved above bar 9, or when bar 11 moved above bar 10. Bar 12 was a signal bar for a higher high (above bar 5) major trend reversal, but most\ntraders assumed that a trading range and a test of the bar 8 bottom of the range was more likely than a bear trend, as is always the case (most\ntrading range breakout attempts fail). Although there was some profit taking in that area between bars 15 and 17, bars 16 and 18 formed a double\ntop bear flag and led to a breakout below the range. Many traders took partial profits in the bar 15 area and moved their protective stops to\nbreakeven, hoping for a bigger swing down, but knowing that the probability was less than 50 percent. However, they sometimes make a windfall\nprofit, as they did here.\nFIGURE 24.13 Best Trades in CX\n", "text_clean": "legged correction and a possible trend reversal.\nThe sell-off to bar 18 broke below a bull trend line, and all of the selling pressure made a sell-off likely, so shorting below the strong bear bar after bar 20 was a high-probability trade. This was a large bear trend bar that closed on its low and formed a large two-bar reversal with bar 20. The size of the bear body and the tiny tails indicated that the selling was very strong.\nFIGURE 24.12 Best Trades in SOLF As shown in Figure 24.12, the best trade setups on the daily chart of Solarfun Power Holdings Company Ltd (SOLF), the Chinese manufacturer of photoelectric cells that are used in solar panels, include the bar 4 high 2 at the moving average, the bar 5 huge reversal down from the third push up, the bar 7 low 2 after two strong pushes down, the bar 8 double bottom bull flag, the small high 2 after bar 9 and again after bar 10, the bar 12 higher high, and the bar 14 two-legged lower high.\nA higher high reversal is usually followed by a lower high short setup. SOLF had a strong move down from the bar 5 high. There was a second large bear trend bar just before bar 6 and several other bear trend bars around bars 3 and 4. These represented selling pressure, which is cumulative and at some point can lead to a trend reversal. However, the bears were unable to string together consecutive bear trend bars after the trend line break, so the always-in position was still long.\nThe sell-off to bar 8 strongly broke the bull trend line, but the sharp rally to bar 9 broke above the bar 7 right shoulder of the head and shoulders top and was therefore likely to have follow-through. After the spike up to bar 9, the market had a channel up to bar 12, which formed a higher high above bar 12. After strong selling down from bar 5, bears were looking to short and bulls were looking to take profits. Some traders saw bar 12 as the third push up in the channel where either bar 9 or bar 10 formed the first push and either bar 10 or bar 11 formed the second push. The bar 12 signal bar was a doji, so some traders may have waited for more bear strength to appear.\nThe strong bear trend bar after bar 12 was a sign of strong selling and gave the bears the confidence to sell aggressively on the next couple of bars. This three-bar bear spike was made of bars with large bear bodies, and the spike broke the bull trend line. Traders believed that more selling was likely, and since the market was now always-in short, they were looking to short rallies.\nThe market formed a two-legged lower high at bar 14 that tested the bar 12 low, and the market sold off from the first tick of the bar. Traders were very confident that the market was going down. Some traders shorted as the market went below the low of the bar before it and became an outside down bar, while other traders shorted the breakout below the bar 13 spike, expecting at least a measured move down.\nThe bear spike down to bar 15 was also strong, but some shorts were trapped out by the sharp rally to bar 18, just above the bar 16 high.

CX had a strong\nbear spike down to bar 3. Traders were expecting lower prices and were looking to short rallies. They shorted the small two-legged rally to the\nmoving average at bar 4. Some traders shorted with limit orders at the moving average because this was the first pullback to the moving average\nafter a strong bear spike. Other traders shorted on stops below bar 4. Bar 4 traded below the bar before it and was a first-entry short, and the\ntraders who shorted below bar 4 were taking the second entry.\nThe larger two-legged rally at bar 7 was a low 2 short setup. Aggressive bears shorted on limit orders above the high of the prior bar and above\nbar 4, and others shorted as the bar fell below the low of the prior bar and generated a second-entry short signal (bar 6 was the first signal). Many\ntraders prefer to short below strong bear trend bars and shorted below bar 7. There were so many traders looking to short there that the market\ngapped down the next day.\nThere was a strong bear spike down to bar 11, and bar 12 broke above the micro channel. Bears shorted below bar 12, expecting the first micro\nchannel breakout attempt to fail.\nAlthough the sideways move to bar 17 broke above a steep bear trend line, the move down to bar 13 was so far below the bar 8 low that traders\nbegan the process of looking for a bottom all over again. They needed another rally to break above a bear trend line and then another test of the\ntrend's low before they would be willing to think that the market was reversing and not just forming another bear rally. The two-legged move up to bar\n17 was strong enough to break well above the moving average and was therefore a sign of buying pressure. Traders shorted below the bar 17 bear\nreversal bar because they saw it as the end of a large two-legged rally and therefore a low 2 short setup. It was also a moving average gap bar\nshort in a bear trend that had yet to clearly flip into an always-in bull trend.\nThe bar 19 outside doji bar was not a strong higher low buy signal bar, but some traders bought above it and above the strong bull trend bar that\nfollowed it, which broke above a bear trend line. It was a breakout test of the longs above bar 14, and it ran the breakeven stops on those longs. A\nbreakout test that runs breakeven stops and then reverses back up in the direction of the new trend is a good risk/reward setup. The risk is to the\nbottom of the signal bar, and the reward is that of a new bull trend, which is many times larger.\nThe bull spike up to bar 20 broke strongly above the moving average and above a long bear trend line. Some traders saw this as a break above\nthe neckline of a sloping head and shoulders bottom. Most traders saw the bull spike from bar 19 to 20 as strong enough so that it should be\nfollowed by higher prices. This means that they saw the market as always-in long. They bought above the bar 21 high 2 setup and again above the\nbar 24 high 2. It was safer to buy above the bull bars at the bar 25 wedge bull flag pullback to the moving average.\nOther traders interpreted the move down to bar 23 as a bear micro channel, but since it was still above the moving average and in a strong bull\ntrend, they believed that it was likely to become part of a bull flag. Therefore, rather than looking for the breakout to fail and then shorting below it, it\nmade more sense to assume that the breakout would fail but the failure would not go far and instead would become a breakout pullback buy signal.\nRemember, when a failed breakout of a bear micro channel fails, it becomes a breakout pullback long entry. Bar 24 was the breakout pullback, but\nit had a bear body, so most traders would not have bought above its high.

{"book": "REVERSAL", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\reversal3.pdf", "page_index": 201, "text_raw": "As shown in Figure 24.14, the best trade setups on this 5 minute chart of Google (GOOG) include the bar 2 and bar 3 low 2 pullbacks to the moving\naverage; buying the bar 4 final flag and wedge bottom reversal; shorting the bar 7 moving average gap bar, low 2, and double top; buying the bar 9\nmajor trend reversal lower low; and buying the bar 10 higher low and stop-running breakout test.\nWhen there is a strong break above the bear trend line, traders will look to buy a test of the bear low, as long as the test does not fall too far\nbelow. GOOG had a strong rally to bar 7, composed of bull trend bars with small tails. It broke above the bear trend line and above the moving\naverage, and there had been several strong bull trend bars in the move down after the bear spike down from bar 1. Those large bull trend bars with\nsmall tails signify that the bulls are willing to buy. That buying pressure is cumulative and, at some point, it can wear down the bears enough so that\nthe bulls can take control of the market.\nAggressive traders would have shorted on a limit order at the high of the bear bar after bar 5. There were three consecutive overlapping bars,\nand any longs were being forced to buy at the top of this trading range. That is an especially bad idea, given that it was right at the bottom of the\nmoving average in a bear day. Since it was likely to fail as a buy, astute traders instead shorted just where the weak bulls were buying.\nThe sell-off from bar 7 had many overlapping bars and several bull bars, which indicated that there was two-sided trading. The bears were not in\ntotal control. As soon as the market fell below the bar 4 bear low, buyers came in on bar 8. They were not able to reverse the market, and the\nmarket fell again below the bear low. Bar 8 was the first break above the bear channel down from bar 7 and therefore not likely to have follow-\nthrough. However, on the bar 9 second attempt to reverse the trend, the bulls were able to own the next three bars. Bar 9 was a breakout pullback\nfrom the bar 8 breakout above the bear micro channel, and a bear channel is a bull flag.\nWhen the bears tried to turn the rally from bar 9 into a three-bar bear flag, the bulls overwhelmed them at the bar 10 higher low. Bar 10 reversed\nback up at 8 cents (8 cents is tiny for a $500 stock) above the signal bar for the bar 9 long and was an excellent breakout test, allowing traders to\nadd on above its high. It also trapped longs out, and they would now chase the market higher. The bulls saw bar 9 as likely leading to at least two\nlegs up, and they therefore placed limit orders to buy at or below the low of the prior bar during the next several bars. They expected any low 1 short\nto fail and to become a higher low. Their buy limit orders would have been filled on bar 10. Their protective stops would have been below the bar 9\nlow.\nThe bears had good shorts earlier in the day. The market gapped down and formed a low 2 short just below the moving average at bar 1.\nAggressive bears would have shorted during the formation of the two large bear trend bars down from bar 1, on their closes, and at one tick below\ntheir lows.\nThe bear spike was so strong that there was likely to have been follow-through selling, most likely in the form of a bear channel, and the day\nwould probably become a spike and channel bear trend day. The bears would have looked to sell rallies, which would be at the top of the\ndeveloping bear channel. Bar 2 was a low 2 short at the moving average and a test of the breakout below the first bar of the day.\nBar 3 was another low 2 short at the moving average, despite the strong bull trend bars in this bear flag.\nBar 4 was a reversal up from a two-bar final bear flag and the third push down in the bear channel, which often leads to at least a two-legged\nreversal. At a minimum, this wedge bottom was likely to behave like a bear stairs pattern and test the low of the prior push down (the swing low at\nthe bottom of the sell-off from bar 2). It was also a second attempt to reverse up where the first was two bars earlier. Although a doji signal bar is not\nideal, the sell-off had many bull trend bars, so not as much force was needed to turn the market up. The bear trend was not all that strong and had a\nlot of two-sided trading within it.\nWhen buying a low in a bear trend, it is usually good to scalp at least a part of the trade so traders would have exited some on the test of the\nmoving average, which was also just above the prior swing low. They then could have moved their protective stops to breakeven. Most traders\nwould have exited once the market fell below the two bear trend bars that began with bar 5, but some would have kept their stops below the bar 4\nbear low.

GOOG had a strong rally to bar 7, composed of bull trend bars with small tails. It broke above the bear trend line and above the moving average, and there had been several strong bull trend bars in the move down after the bear spike down from bar 1. Those large bull trend bars with small tails signify that the bulls are willing to buy. That buying pressure is cumulative and, at some point, it can wear down the bears enough so that the bulls can take control of the market.\nAggressive traders would have shorted on a limit order at the high of the bear bar after bar 5. There were three consecutive overlapping bars, and any longs were being forced to buy at the top of this trading range. That is an especially bad idea, given that it was right at the bottom of the moving average in a bear day. Since it was likely to fail as a buy, astute traders instead shorted just where the weak bulls were buying.\nThe sell-off from bar 7 had many overlapping bars and several bull bars, which indicated that there was two-sided trading. The bears were not in total control. As soon as the market fell below the bar 4 bear low, buyers came in on bar 8. They were not able to reverse the market, and the market fell again below the bear low. Bar 8 was the first break above the bear channel down from bar 7 and therefore not likely to have followthrough. However, on the bar 9 second attempt to reverse the trend, the bulls were able to own the next three bars. Bar 9 was a breakout pullback from the bar 8 breakout above the bear micro channel, and a bear channel is a bull flag.\nWhen the bears tried to turn the rally from bar 9 into a three-bar bear flag, the bulls overwhelmed them at the bar 10 higher low. Bar 10 reversed back up at 8 cents (8 cents is tiny for a $500 stock) above the signal bar for the bar 9 long and was an excellent breakout test, allowing traders to add on above its high. It also trapped longs out, and they would now chase the market higher. The bulls saw bar 9 as likely leading to at least two legs up, and they therefore placed limit orders to buy at or below the low of the prior bar during the next several bars. They expected any low 1 short to fail and to become a higher low. Their buy limit orders would have been filled on bar 10. Their protective stops would have been below the bar 9 low.\nThe bears had good shorts earlier in the day. The market gapped down and formed a low 2 short just below the moving average at bar 1.\nAggressive bears would have shorted during the formation of the two large bear trend bars down from bar 1, on their closes, and at one tick below their lows.\nThe bear spike was so strong that there was likely to have been follow-through selling, most likely in the form of a bear channel, and the day would probably become a spike and channel bear trend day. The bears would have looked to sell rallies, which would be at the top of the developing bear channel. Bar 2 was a low 2 short at the moving average and a test of the breakout below the first bar of the day.\nBar 3 was another low 2 short at the moving average, despite the strong bull trend bars in this bear flag.\nBar 4 was a reversal up from a two-bar final bear flag and the third push down in the bear channel, which often leads to at least a two-legged reversal. At a minimum, this wedge bottom was likely to behave like a bear stairs pattern and test the low of the prior push down (the swing low at the bottom of the sell-off from bar 2). It was also a second attempt to reverse up where the first was two bars earlier. Although a doji signal bar is not ideal, the sell-off had many bull trend bars, so not as much force was needed to turn the market up. The bear trend was not all that strong and had a lot of two-sided trading within it.\nWhen buying a low in a bear trend, it is usually good to scalp at least a part of the trade so traders would have exited some on the test of the moving average, which was also just above the prior swing low. They then could have moved their protective stops to breakeven. Most traders would have exited once the market fell below the two bear trend bars that began with bar 5, but some would have kept their stops below the bar 4 bear low. This was not yet a strong bottom because the rally to bar 5 barely broke above the trend line, and therefore the market was still always-in short. It was prudent for bulls to be cautious and get out early.\nBar 7 was an acceptable moving average gap short, a double top bear flag with bar 3, and two legs up in a bear trend. However, it would have been risky to short below a bull trend bar, especially following a three-bar bull spike.

The market has inertia, and when it is in a trading\nrange, most attempts to break out fail. The bears expected a test of the top of Oracle's 5 minute trading range of the past couple of days, so there\nwas no reason to short until the market reached that area. This made the market one-sided in the rally up to bar 2, but once the market reached the\ntop of the trading range, the bears appeared as if out of nowhere. They now doubted the market would go much higher without a pullback, and they\nshorted relentlessly. The three-push rally to bar 4 was an excellent setup to short below the two-bar reversal.\nFIGURE 24.20 Emini Opening Reversal\nThe best trade setups on the 5 minute Emini chart on the right in Figure 24.20 include the bar 6 opening reversal, the bar 7 final flag top and wedge\ntop (the high of the bar before bar 6 was the first leg up, even though it was a bear bar), the bar 8 wedge bull flag and higher low, the bar 10\nbreakout pullback from the bar 9 breakout above the bear micro channel, the bar 11 low 2 and double top (with the top of the wedge down to bar 8),\nthe bar 12 large two-legged (bar 10 was the first push down) higher low major trend reversal (bar 12 was reversing up from the small bear trend\ndown to bar 10 and from the large bear trend that ended at bar 6), and the bar 14 higher low major trend reversal and second entry breakout\npullback buy signal (it was also the right shoulder of a head and shoulders bottom, where bar 10 was the left shoulder).\nAlthough most academics and television pundits argue that all moves in the overall market are based on the composite fundamentals of the\nindividual stocks, politics often creates huge moves. An obvious example is the incredible bull market that took place when the Republicans took\ncontrol of Congress in 1994, often referred to as the Clinton super bull market. The crash of 2008 is another example.

The\ninitial swing of the day often begins with a double top or bottom. The range was about half of an average daily range, so the day was likely to have a\nbreakout and become a trending trading range day up or down, and then later have a pullback to test the breakout of the initial range.\nThe bear spike to bar 4 turned the market into an always-in bear day, so traders were looking to short rallies and expected a downside breakout\nand then about a measured move down. The bull channel to bar 6 was a three-push rally and had many overlapping bars and several minor reversal\nattempts. It was much weaker than the sell-off to bar 4. Once traders decided that there was not going to be a strong bull breakout above the\nchannel, they believed that the channel was a bear flag and would be followed by a bear trend. Bar 6 missed the breakeven stops below bar 3 by a\ntick, which was a sign of strength by the bears. They successfully defended their stops by aggressively shorting more at bar 6.\nAggressive traders would have placed limit orders to go short at or above the doji bar that followed the bar 6 two-bar reversal. They saw this as a\nweak high 1 buy setup that was likely to fail.\nBar 9 was a strong bull reversal bar, but since it overlapped so much of the prior bar, it functioned as a two-bar reversal. Since its high was at the\nhigh of the prior bar, it did not matter if a trader saw it as a two-bar reversal or as a bull reversal bar. In either case, it was a strong reversal setup on\na trending trading range day and was in the area of a measured move down, and it followed the bar 8 final flag. It was also the third push down on\nthe day. All of these factors led traders to believe that the market would have at least a two-legged rally that would test the bar 4 low. Buying as bar\n9 moved above the bull reversal bar before it was an entry that had about a 60 percent chance of leading to a profitable swing trade, and therefore\nwas a strong setup for all traders, including beginners. The bull reversal bar was a strong signal bar for the reversal up from the low 2 final flag that\ntriggered below bar 8, and for the large parabolic wedge bottom (the first push down ended three bars after bar 1 and the second push down\nended at bar 4). Although bar 9 was a bear bar, it did not hit the protective stop below the bull signal bar. Other traders bought above bar 9, since it\nwas a second-entry buy signal as a micro double bottom with the bull signal bar. It was likely to go up for at least a measured move based on the\nheight of the micro double bottom (about twice the height of the move up from the bottom of the bull bar to the top of bar 9), and since there was a\nlarge bottoming pattern, it was likely to go up much further, like for at least ten bars and two legs.\nNote that there were several minor reversals and that most reversals come from double tops and bottoms, micro double tops and bottoms, and\nfinal flags, as is always the case. Many traders will not take a reversal trade unless one of these is present.\nFIGURE 24.23 Several Best Trades in the Emini with No Clear Trend\nAs shown in Figure 24.23, the best trades on this 5 minute Emini chart include the bar 1 two-bar reversal after the gap spike and channel bottom;\nthe bar 2 reversal at a new high of the day and spike and channel top; the bar 3 micro channel failed breakout (a low 1); the bar 5 third push down\non the day, lower low, and final flag breakout and reversal up at the bottom of a trading range; and the bar 6 double top, spike and channel top, low\n4, and top of a trading range.\n", "text_clean": "12.\nFIGURE 24.22 Best Trades in the Emini with Two-Sided Trading The best trade setups on the 5 minute Emini chart shown in Figure 24.22 include the two-bar reversal up from the low of the prior day that formed three bars after bar 1, the double top at bar 3, the wedge bear flag at bar 7, and the bar 9 small final flag and reversal up in a trending trading range day and stairs pattern.\nWhen a day is not a trend day, it is a trading range day, or at least it will have a lot of two-sided trading.\nBar 2 took out the high of the open, so smart traders would have been looking for a second-entry short, which came at the bar 3 double top.

The range was about half of an average daily range, so the day was likely to have a breakout and become a trending trading range day up or down, and then later have a pullback to test the breakout of the initial range.\nThe bear spike to bar 4 turned the market into an always-in bear day, so traders were looking to short rallies and expected a downside breakout and then about a measured move down. The bull channel to bar 6 was a three-push rally and had many overlapping bars and several minor reversal attempts. It was much weaker than the sell-off to bar 4. Once traders decided that there was not going to be a strong bull breakout above the channel, they believed that the channel was a bear flag and would be followed by a bear trend. Bar 6 missed the breakeven stops below bar 3 by a tick, which was a sign of strength by the bears. They successfully defended their stops by aggressively shorting more at bar 6.\nAggressive traders would have placed limit orders to go short at or above the doji bar that followed the bar 6 two-bar reversal. They saw this as a weak high 1 buy setup that was likely to fail.\nBar 9 was a strong bull reversal bar, but since it overlapped so much of the prior bar, it functioned as a two-bar reversal. Since its high was at the high of the prior bar, it did not matter if a trader saw it as a two-bar reversal or as a bull reversal bar. In either case, it was a strong reversal setup on a trending trading range day and was in the area of a measured move down, and it followed the bar 8 final flag. It was also the third push down on the day. All of these factors led traders to believe that the market would have at least a two-legged rally that would test the bar 4 low. Buying as bar 9 moved above the bull reversal bar before it was an entry that had about a 60 percent chance of leading to a profitable swing trade, and therefore was a strong setup for all traders, including beginners. The bull reversal bar was a strong signal bar for the reversal up from the low 2 final flag that triggered below bar 8, and for the large parabolic wedge bottom (the first push down ended three bars after bar 1 and the second push down ended at bar 4). Although bar 9 was a bear bar, it did not hit the protective stop below the bull signal bar. Other traders bought above bar 9, since it was a second-entry buy signal as a micro double bottom with the bull signal bar. It was likely to go up for at least a measured move based on the height of the micro double bottom (about twice the height of the move up from the bottom of the bull bar to the top of bar 9), and since there was a large bottoming pattern, it was likely to go up much further, like for at least ten bars and two legs.\nNote that there were several minor reversals and that most reversals come from double tops and bottoms, micro double tops and bottoms, and final flags, as is always the case. Many traders will not take a reversal trade unless one of these is present.\nFIGURE 24.23 Several Best Trades in the Emini with No Clear Trend As shown in Figure 24.23, the best trades on this 5 minute Emini chart include the bar 1 two-bar reversal after the gap spike and channel bottom; the bar 2 reversal at a new high of the day and spike and channel top; the bar 3 micro channel failed breakout (a low 1); the bar 5 third push down on the day, lower low, and final flag breakout and reversal up at the bottom of a trading range; and the bar 6 double top, spike and channel top, low 4, and top of a trading range.", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["12.", "FIGURE 24.22 Best Trades in the Emini with Two-Sided Trading", "The best trade setups on the 5 minute Emini chart shown in Figure 24.22 include the two-bar reversal up from the low of the prior day that formed", "three bars after bar 1, the double top at bar 3, the wedge bear flag at bar 7, and the bar 9 small final flag and reversal up in a trending trading range", "day and stairs pattern.", "When a day is not a trend day, it is a trading range day, or at least it will have a lot of two-sided trading.", "Bar 2 took out the high of the open, so smart traders would have been looking for a second-entry short, which came at the bar 3 double top.

Since it might have just turned into a one- or two-bar bear flag, traders waited for a second entry to buy.\nAggressive traders would have bought on a limit order at or below the low of the bar after bar 4, expecting an attempt at a second leg up. They saw\nthis as a weak low 1 short setup and therefore likely to fail.\nBar 5 was a reversal up from the second attempt to break out to a new low below low 1. The inside bar that formed the signal bar had a bull\nclose.\nBar 6 was a low 4 short that reversed after breaking out above the bar 3 swing high.\nFIGURE 24.24 With a 50 Percent Chance of Success, the Reward Must Be Twice as Large as the Risk\nEven though selling in the middle of a trading range might have only about a 50 percent chance of success, if the reward is twice the size of the risk,\nit can be a best trade. As shown in Figure 24.24, the 5 minute Emini, which had been in a strong bull trend for several weeks, had a moving\naverage gap bar at bar 7. This often leads to the final test of the bull high before a deeper correction that has at least a couple of legs. The small\ngap opening down to bar 10 was immediately followed by a rally to just above the moving average. The bears were looking for a second leg down,\nbut were unsure if the one-bar drop to bar 10 was enough to constitute a first leg. When a move is unclear, there are usually not enough traders who\nbelieve that it will succeed, and therefore not enough traders are willing to bet on it. The result is that there is no follow-through until there is more\nclarity. The two-legged move to bar 12 led to a two-legged rally to bar 13, which some traders saw as a small wedge bear flag. Others saw it as the\nright shoulder of a head and shoulders top where bar 6 was the left shoulder. Some also saw it as a double top bear flag with bar 11. It was a high\nthat was below the bar 9 high and below the high around bar 11, and it could have been the start of a larger second leg down.\nSince shorting below bar 11 was in the middle of a two-day trading range, the directional probability of an equidistant move was about 50\npercent. There was about a 50 percent chance of a one-point move up before a one-point move down, and a 50 percent chance of a one-point\nmove down before a one-point move up. The same was true for two, three, or four points. In general, when the market is in a trading range and it is\nup for five to 10 bars, traders should only look for shorts. Bar 11 was the eighth bar since the opening low, and the bar that followed it marked the\nthird time that the market had fallen below the low of the prior bar. Traders could have shorted here or even on the first or second attempt down,\nhoping that enough traders saw this as a potential lower high so that there would be more selling. Since it was not convincing, the move down did\nnot begin until after a clearer lower high at bar 13.\nSo why was shorting around bar 11 a best trade when there was only a 50 percent chance of success and it was in the middle of a trading range\nin a bull trend? Remember that the trader's equation has three variables and that you have to consider reward and risk in addition to probability.\nSince the average daily range in the Emini had been over 10 points for the past month or so and today's range was only two points, and there were\nonly a handful of days in the past couple of years when the range was under five or six points, the odds were high that today's range was going to\ndouble or triple before the close. The problem was that traders did not know if the breakout would be up or down, or both. Since the market was up\nfor eight bars in a trading range, the odds favored a move down in the near term. Traders could simply have shorted and put a protective stop\nabove the bar 11 signal bar, placed a one cancels the other (OCO) limit order four points below the entry, and then patiently waited. Since there\nwas so much uncertainty, they could take this trade only if they were willing to sit through pullbacks, which were inevitable in a trading range. The\nactual risk was only four ticks, so traders were risking four ticks to make 16 ticks and they had about a 50 percent chance of success. This made\nthis an excellent trade even though it might not have appeared so at the time.\nOnce there was a large bear breakout bar and then the immediate follow-through at bar 12, the market was always-in short for most traders, and\nthey would assume that it would stay that way unless there was an always-in buy signal or until the market went above the top of the bear spike that\nhad begun with the small bear bar after bar 11. Bar 13 tested the high of that bar to the tick, and the market eventually sold off to bar 19. The bar 19\nlow was 17 ticks below the bar 11 signal bar, and bar 19 had a bull body. This was a possible 17 tick failure, meaning that many bears were taking\nprofits on their shorts at 16 ticks below the signal bar instead of 17 ticks below. They were getting out one tick shy of a four-point move, which was\na sign that the bears were weak. The market hit the limit order for the shorts to exit with a four-tick profit, and the bar turned into a bull reversal bar.\nMost bears would have exited above the bar 19 bull reversal bar because of the 17 tick failure, taking 11 ticks’ profit instead of hoping for the\nmarket to go back down and give them the 16 ticks that they had originally planned to make.\nThis was the week before Christmas, and the average daily range around the holidays is usually less. There were several days in the past couple\nof weeks when the range was under seven points. Also, since the initial risk was only four ticks instead of the usually seven or eight ticks, many\ntraders assumed that the smaller risk and the smaller recent average range meant that the chance of making four points might also be smaller.\nMany of these traders bet on the 17 tick failure and placed their limit orders at 15 ticks below their entry price instead of six ticks below. Whenever\na move has an increased chance of coming up short, many traders will use a limit order that is one tick less than usual, knowing that the market\n", "text_clean": "On a day that is not a clear trend day, traders should look to fade new extremes, especially second entries and wedges.\nBar 1 was a wedge reversal with a strong reversal bar.\nBar 2 was a wedge top, a double top, and a second-entry moving average gap bar short.\nBar 3 was a signal bar for the breakout test, which hit the breakeven stops of the shorts below bar 2.\nBar 4 was a doji in a steep decline.

The result is that there is no follow-through until there is more clarity. The two-legged move to bar 12 led to a two-legged rally to bar 13, which some traders saw as a small wedge bear flag. Others saw it as the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top where bar 6 was the left shoulder. Some also saw it as a double top bear flag with bar 11. It was a high that was below the bar 9 high and below the high around bar 11, and it could have been the start of a larger second leg down.\nSince shorting below bar 11 was in the middle of a two-day trading range, the directional probability of an equidistant move was about 50 percent.

Because “rules” imply absolutes and easy trading if only you follow them. However, trading is subjective, your edge is\nalways going to be small, and it is very difficult to get to the point where you are consistently successful. If there were clear, objective rules and they\nconsistently resulted in profitable trades, everyone would soon discover them. There would quickly be no one left to take the opposite side of the\ntrade, and the rules would then stop working.\nHere are 78 suggested guidelines.\n1. Reading these 570,000 words is like reading a detailed manual on how to do anything, such as playing golf or a violin. It takes a lot of hard\nwork to turn the information into the ability to make a living as a trader, but it is impossible without understanding how markets work. Like being a\nprofessional golfer or violinist, no matter how good you get, you always want to be better, so the challenge and satisfaction last long after you\nbecome consistently profitable.\n2. Everything that you see is in a gray fog. Nothing is perfectly clear. Close is close enough. If something looks like a reliable pattern, it will likely\ntrade like a reliable pattern.\n3. There is no easy set of reliable rules to make money as a trader, and everything is subjective. This is a zero-sum game with very smart players,\nso when an edge exists, it is small and fleeting. For a trader to make money, he has to be consistently better than half of the other traders out\nthere (or more accurately, trade a positive trader's equation more than half of the time). Since most of the competitors are profitable institutions, a\ntrader has to be very good. However, edges appear constantly, and if you learn to spot them and understand how to trade them, you are in a\nposition to make money.\n4. The edge can never get very large because institutions would take advantage of it as it was growing. A trade cannot have a high probability of\nmaking a big reward relative to the risk.\n5. Reading charts well is difficult, but it is only half of what you need to know to make money. You also need to learn to trade, which is just as\ndifficult. Trading successfully always has been and will always continue to be hard to do, no matter what method you use. If there were an easy\nway to make money, everyone would do it and then there would be no trapped traders to drive the market to your target. Read a book that\nteaches you how to play the violin and then go out to see if the world will give you money to hear you play. Just because you understand how to do\nsomething does not mean that you can do it effectively, especially if it is difficult to do.\n6. A trader needs a mathematical advantage to make money. At every moment, there is always a mathematical edge for both a long and a short\ntrade, but the edges are usually not clear. When they are relatively clear, they are fleeting and small. However, those are the times when traders\nneed to place their trades.\n7. The ability to spot trades that have a positive trader's equation is the key to success. That can mean buying above a bar on a stop, selling\nabove a bar with a limit order, buying below a bar with a limit order, or selling below a bar on a stop.\n8. The single most important determination that a trader makes, and he makes this after the close of every bar, is whether there will be more\nbuyers or sellers above and below the prior bar. This is particularly true with breakouts and failed breakouts, because the move that follows\nusually determines the always-in direction and therefore lasts for many points and is not just a scalp.\n9. Every time you buy above the high of the prior bar on a stop, someone else is shorting there with a limit order. When you sell one tick below the\nlow of the prior bar, there is a strong bull who is taking the other side of your trade. Always remember that nothing is certain, and the edge is\nalways small because there are smart people who believe the exact opposite of what you do.\n10. Every bar, even a strong trend bar, is a signal bar for both directions, and the market can begin a trend up or down on the next bar. Be open to\nall possibilities, including the exact opposite of what you expect, and when the surprise happens, don't question or deny it. Just read it and trade\nit.\n11. Every time you look to enter a setup, make sure to consider what the market is telling you if instead it breaks out of the opposite end of the\nsignal bar. Sometimes that buy setup that you see might in fact also be a great sell setup because it will trap longs who will cover below the low of\nthe signal or entry bars.\n12. Understanding trend bars that create breakouts is one of the most important skills that a trader can acquire. Traders need to be able to\nassess whether a breakout is likely to succeed, or it will be met with profit taking and a pullback, or it will be followed by a reversal.\n13. Look for signs of strength and weakness and weigh them to determine if they give you an edge. If you see the market doing something,\nassess how strong the setup is. Did it fail to take an opportunity to do something strong? If so, the setup is weaker.\n14. Whenever you are positive that your setup is good, don't take the trade. You are missing something. You don't see what the person who is\ntaking the other side of your trade is seeing, and that person is just as smart as you are. Be humble.

Because “rules” imply absolutes and easy trading if only you follow them. However, trading is subjective, your edge is always going to be small, and it is very difficult to get to the point where you are consistently successful. If there were clear, objective rules and they consistently resulted in profitable trades, everyone would soon discover them. There would quickly be no one left to take the opposite side of the trade, and the rules would then stop working.\nHere are 78 suggested guidelines.\n1. Reading these 570,000 words is like reading a detailed manual on how to do anything, such as playing golf or a violin. It takes a lot of hard work to turn the information into the ability to make a living as a trader, but it is impossible without understanding how markets work. Like being a professional golfer or violinist, no matter how good you get, you always want to be better, so the challenge and satisfaction last long after you become consistently profitable.\n2. Everything that you see is in a gray fog. Nothing is perfectly clear. Close is close enough. If something looks like a reliable pattern, it will likely trade like a reliable pattern.\n3. There is no easy set of reliable rules to make money as a trader, and everything is subjective. This is a zero-sum game with very smart players, so when an edge exists, it is small and fleeting. For a trader to make money, he has to be consistently better than half of the other traders out there (or more accurately, trade a positive trader's equation more than half of the time). Since most of the competitors are profitable institutions, a trader has to be very good. However, edges appear constantly, and if you learn to spot them and understand how to trade them, you are in a position to make money.\n4. The edge can never get very large because institutions would take advantage of it as it was growing. A trade cannot have a high probability of making a big reward relative to the risk.\n5. Reading charts well is difficult, but it is only half of what you need to know to make money. You also need to learn to trade, which is just as difficult. Trading successfully always has been and will always continue to be hard to do, no matter what method you use. If there were an easy way to make money, everyone would do it and then there would be no trapped traders to drive the market to your target. Read a book that teaches you how to play the violin and then go out to see if the world will give you money to hear you play. Just because you understand how to do something does not mean that you can do it effectively, especially if it is difficult to do.\n6. A trader needs a mathematical advantage to make money. At every moment, there is always a mathematical edge for both a long and a short trade, but the edges are usually not clear. When they are relatively clear, they are fleeting and small. However, those are the times when traders need to place their trades.\n7. The ability to spot trades that have a positive trader's equation is the key to success. That can mean buying above a bar on a stop, selling above a bar with a limit order, buying below a bar with a limit order, or selling below a bar on a stop.\n8. The single most important determination that a trader makes, and he makes this after the close of every bar, is whether there will be more buyers or sellers above and below the prior bar. This is particularly true with breakouts and failed breakouts, because the move that follows usually determines the always-in direction and therefore lasts for many points and is not just a scalp.\n9. Every time you buy above the high of the prior bar on a stop, someone else is shorting there with a limit order. When you sell one tick below the low of the prior bar, there is a strong bull who is taking the other side of your trade. Always remember that nothing is certain, and the edge is always small because there are smart people who believe the exact opposite of what you do.\n10. Every bar, even a strong trend bar, is a signal bar for both directions, and the market can begin a trend up or down on the next bar. Be open to all possibilities, including the exact opposite of what you expect, and when the surprise happens, don't question or deny it. Just read it and trade it.\n11. Every time you look to enter a setup, make sure to consider what the market is telling you if instead it breaks out of the opposite end of the signal bar. Sometimes that buy setup that you see might in fact also be a great sell setup because it will trap longs who will cover below the low of the signal or entry bars.\n12. Understanding trend bars that create breakouts is one of the most important skills that a trader can acquire. Traders need to be able to assess whether a breakout is likely to succeed, or it will be met with profit taking and a pullback, or it will be followed by a reversal.\n13. Look for signs of strength and weakness and weigh them to determine if they give you an edge. If you see the market doing something, assess how strong the setup is. Did it fail to take an opportunity to do something strong? If so, the setup is weaker.\n14. Whenever you are positive that your setup is good, don't take the trade. You are missing something. You don't see what the person who is taking the other side of your trade is seeing, and that person is just as smart as you are. Be humble. If you are too confident, your arrogance will make you lose because you will be using unrealistically high probabilities in your evaluation of the trader's equation.\n15. Much of life is not what it seems. In fact, the famous mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was not what he seemed to be and is better known as Lewis Carroll. We work in an Alice in Wonderland world where nothing is really as it seems. Up is not always up and down is not always down.

Switch to\ntrading 100 to 300 shares of SPY and swing for at least 20 to 50 cents. Even though you won't get rich, at least you will make some money and\nbuild your confidence. If you think that you can comfortably trade three Emini contracts per trade, then you should trade just one. This will make it\nmuch easier for you to take every signal. If you trade three Eminis, you will let many good signals go because you really are comfortable trading\nonly three contracts in the rare case of a perfect signal. You need to be trading a size where you are comfortable with any decent signal and\nremain comfortable if you lose two or three times in a row. One indicator of this comfort is your ability to take the next trade after those losses. If\nyou feel too uncomfortable and are really waiting for perfection, you are still trading too much volume. Once you start cherry-picking, you are on the\npath to a blown account. Your emotions are a burden and give an edge to your opponents, as is the case in any competition.\n28. “I don't care!” That is the most useful mantra.

I don't care that the market is way overdone and is due for a\ncorrection. I don't care about indicators, especially squiggly lines that show divergences in a huge trend (meanwhile, there has been no trend line\nbreak), but I do care about the one chart in front of me and what it is telling me. I also care about following my rules and not allowing any outside\ninfluence talk me out of doing what my rules are telling me.\n29. If you are afraid of taking a great trade because your stop would have to be too far, reduce your position size to maybe a quarter of normal so\nthat your total dollar risk is no larger than for your usual trades. You need to get into the “I don't care” mode to be able to take these trades. By\ncutting your position size, you can focus on the quality of the setup instead of being preoccupied with the dollars that you can lose if the trade fails.\nHowever, first spot a good setup before adopting the “I don't care” mind-set, because you don't want to be so apathetic about the dollars that you\nbegin to take weak setups and then go on to lose money.\n30.

Trapped traders will be forced out\nas you are getting in, and they will likely wait for more price action before entering again in their original direction, so the only traders left will be in\nyour direction.\n37. Seeing traders getting trapped out of a trade on a stop run is as reliable a signal as seeing them getting trapped in a trade. If the market\nsuddenly runs stops and then resumes its trend, this is a reliable setup for at least a scalper's profit.\n38. Wait. If the market has not given any signals for 30 to 60 minutes and you find yourself checking your e-mail or talking on the phone with your\ndaughter away at college, and suddenly the market makes a large bull trend bar that breaks out of a trading range, wait. You've lost touch with the\nmarket and it is trying to trap you in. Never make a quick decision to place a trade, especially on a sudden, large trend bar. If it turns into a great\ntrade and you miss it, you will still be ahead overall because the odds are against you when you take trades under these circumstances. Yes,\nsome will be winners, but if you review all of the times that you took these trades, you will discover that you lost money.\n39. You don't have to trade. You goal as a trader is to make money, not to make trades, so take a trade only when it will help you achieve your\ngoal. There will be many other signals all day long, so wait for a good one, and don't be upset when you miss good trades. Many beginners want\nexcitement and tend to overtrade. Many great traders find trading to be lonely and boring, but very profitable. Everyone wants to trade, but you\nshould want to make money more than you want to trade. You should take only trades that are likely to make money, not simply relieve your\ntension from not having placed a trade in an hour or two.\n40. Simple is better. You don't need indicators, and you should look at only one chart. If you can't make money off a single chart with no indicators,\nadding more things to analyze will just make it more difficult. Also, trade only the very best setups until you are consistently profitable. The single\nbiggest problem with using two charts is that there is a natural tendency to take only signals that occur simultaneously on both charts, which rarely\nhappens. You end up rejecting most of the day's great signals because the second chart does not have a signal or the signal occurred two ticks\nearlier. For example, if you see a great high 2 pullback to the exponential moving average in a bull trend on the 5 minute chart and then look at the\n2 or 3 minute chart and see that it gave an entry two ticks earlier, you might not take the 5 minute entry because you will be afraid that the move\nwill stop at the 2 minute scalper's target and never reach the 5 minute target.\n41. Decide whether this is a hobby or a job. If it is a hobby, find another one because this one will be too expensive and it is dangerously\naddictive. All great traders are likely trading addicts, but most trading addicts will likely end up broke.\n42. Begin trading using a 5 minute chart, entering on a pullback and using a stop order for your entry. When the market is in a bull trend, look to\nbuy above a bull bar at the moving average. When it is in a bear trend, look to short below a bear bar at the moving average. Take some or all off\non a limit order at a profit target around the prior extreme of the trend, and then move the protective stop to breakeven on any remaining\ncontracts.\n43. When starting out, you should consider trading the SPY instead of the Emini. One Emini is virtually identical to 500 SPY shares, and trading\n200 to 500 SPY shares would allow you to scale out as you swing part of your trade, yet not incur much risk. Once you reach 1,000 to 1,500 SPY\nshares, if you are thinking that you will continue to increase your position size, then switch to the Emini. At that size, you can scale out of the Emini\nand you can increase your position size tremendously without slippage being a significant issue.\n44. Buy low and sell high, except in a clear and strong trend (see Part I in book 1 on trends). In a bull trend, buy high 2 setups even if they are at\nthe high of the day; in a bear trend, sell low 2 setups. However, the market is in a trading range for the vast majority of the time. For example, if the\nmarket has been going up for a few bars and there is now a buy signal near the top of this leg up, ask yourself if you believe that the market is in\none of the established clear and strong bull trend patterns described in these books. If you cannot convince yourself that it is, don't buy high, even\nif the momentum looks great, since the odds are great that you will be trapped. Remember Warren Buffett's version of the old saw, “Be afraid\nwhen others are greedy and be greedy when others are afraid.”\n45. The two most important feelings for the media and for beginners are fear and greed. Profitable traders feel neither. For them, the two most\nimportant feelings are uncertainty (confusion) and urgency, and they use both to make money. Every bar and every segment of every market is\neither a trend or a trading range. When a trader is certain, the market is in a strong trend. When he feels a sense of urgency, like he wants to buy\nas the market is going up (or short as it is going down) but is desperate for a pullback, the market is in a strong trend. He will buy at least a small\nposition at the market instead of waiting for a pullback.\n46. When a trader is uncertain or confused, the market is in a trading range and he should only buy low and sell high. If he wants to take many\ntrades, only scalp. Uncertainty means that the market has a lot of two-sided trading and therefore might be forming a trading range. Since most\nbreakout attempts fail, it is better to only look to short if you are uncertain and the market is up for five to 10 bars, and only look for longs when it is\ndown for five to 10 bars.\n47. When there is a trading range, buy low means that if the market is near the bottom of the range and you are short, you can buy back your short\nfor a profit, and if there is a strong buy signal, you can buy to initiate a long. Likewise, when the market is toward the top of the range, you sell\nhigh. This selling can be to take your profit on your long, or, if there is a good short setup, you can sell to initiate a short position.\n48. Good fill, bad trade. Always be suspicious if the market lets you in or out at a price that is better than you anticipated. The corollary of bad fill,\ngood trade is not as reliable.\n49. The first hour or two is usually the easiest time to make money, because the swings tend to be large and there are not many doji bars. The\nfirst hour is the easiest time to lose money as well, because you are overly confident about how easy it might be, and you don't follow your rules\ncarefully. The first hour usually has many reversals, so patiently wait for a swing setup, which will generally have less than a 50 percent chance of\nsuccess but a potential reward that is at least twice as large as the risk. Experienced traders can scalp. If you don't follow your rules and are in the\nred, you've missed the easiest time of the day to make money, which means that you will be unhappy all day as you hope to get back to\nbreakeven in trading that is much slower and less profitable.\n50. If you are down on the day and you are now in the second half of the day, it can feel like you are swimming in quicksand—the harder you try to\nget out, the deeper you sink.

All patterns fail and the failures often fail, and when they do, they create a breakout pullback in the original direction and have a high probability of success.\n36.

If you have an approach that\nmakes you money, stick with it and you will earn back your loss tomorrow. Using a different approach will only cost you more.\n51. Beginners should avoid trading in the middle of the day when the market is in the middle of a day's range, especially if the moving average is\nrelatively flat and the trading range is tight and has prominent tails (barbwire). When you are about to take any trade, always ask yourself if the\nsetup is one of the best of the day. Is this the one that the institutions have been waiting for all day? If the answer is no and you are not a\nconsistently profitable trader, then you should not take the trade, either.\n52. A tight trading range is the worst environment for entering on stops. The institutions are doing the opposite, and you will consistently lose if you\ninsist on trading, hoping that a trend is about to begin.\n53. A tight trading range trumps everything. That means that it is more important than every good reason that you have to buy or sell. Unless you\nare a great trader, once you sense that a tight trading range might be forming, force yourself to not take any trades, even if you don't trade for\nhours.\n54. Every bar and every series of bars is either a trend or a trading range. Pick one. Decide on the always-in direction and trade only in that\ndirection until it changes. Throughout the day and especially around 8:30 a.m. PST, you need to be deciding whether the day resembles any trend\npattern described in these books. If it does and you are looking to take any trade, you must take every with-trend trade. Never consider taking a\ncountertrend trade if you haven't been taking all of the with-trend trades.\n55. The best signal bars are trend bars in the direction of your trade. Doji bars are one-bar trading ranges and therefore usually terrible signal\nbars. You will usually lose if you buy above a trading range or sell below one.\n56. Most countertrend setups fail, and most with-trend setups succeed. Do the math and decide which you should be trading. Trends constantly\nform great-looking countertrend setups and lousy-looking with-trend setups. If you trade countertrend, you are gambling and, although you will\noften win and have fun, the math is against you and you will slowly but surely go broke. Countertrend setups in strong trends almost always fail and\nbecome great with-trend setups, especially on the 1 minute chart.\n57. You will not make consistent money until you stop trading countertrend scalps. You will win often enough to keep you trying to improve your\ntechnique, but over time your account will slowly disappear. Remember, your risk will likely have to be as large as your profit target, so it will\nusually take six winners just to get back to breakeven after four losses, and this is a very depressing prospect. Realistically, you should scalp only\nif you can win 60 percent of the time, and most traders should avoid any trade where the potential reward is not at least as large as the risk.\nBeginners should scalp only with the trend, if at all.\n58. Until you are consistently profitable, take only trades where your potential reward is at least as large as your risk. If you need to risk two points\nin the Emini, do not take your profit until you have at least two points. Most traders should not scalp for a reward that is smaller than the risk,\nbecause they will lose money even if they win on 60 percent of their trades. Remember the trader's equation. The chance of winning times your\npotential reward has to be significantly greater than the chance of losing times your risk. You cannot risk two points to make one point and hope to\nmake a profit unless you are right at least 80 percent of the time, and very few traders are that good.\n59. The trader's equation has three variables, and any setup with a positive result is a good trade. This can be a trade with a high probability of\nsuccess and a reward only equal to the risk, one with a low probability of success and a huge reward relative to risk, or anything in between.\n60. Experienced traders can scale into (or out of) trades to improve their trader's equation. For example, the initial entry might have a relatively\nlow probability of success, but subsequent entries might have significantly higher probabilities, improving the trader's equation for the entire\nposition.\n61. You will not make money until you start trading with-trend pullbacks.\n62. You will not make money trading reversals until you wait for a break of a significant trend line and then for a strong reversal bar on a test of the\ntrend's extreme.\n63. You will not make money unless you know what you are doing. Print out the 5 minute Emini chart every day (and stock charts, if you trade\nstocks) and write on the chart every setup that you see. When you see several price action features, write them all on the chart. Do this every day\nfor years until you can look at any part of any chart and instantly understand what is happening.\n64. You will not make money in the long term until you know enough about your personality to find a trading style that is compatible. You need to\nbe able to follow your rules comfortably, allowing you to enter and exit trades with minimal or no uncertainty or anxiety. Once you have mastered a\nmethod of trading, if you feel stress while trading, then you haven't yet found either your style or yourself.\n65. You will not make money if you lose your discipline and take risky trades in the final couple of hours that you would never take in the first\ncouple of hours. You will invariably give back those earnings from earlier in the day that fooled you into thinking that you are a better trader than\nyou really are.\n66. You are competing against computers. They have the edge of speed, so it is usually best not to trade during a report, because that is when\ntheir speed edge is greatest. They also have the edge of not being emotional, so don't trade when you are upset or distracted. Third, they have\nthe edge of never getting tired, so don't trade when you are worn out, which often happens at the end of the day.\n67. Always look for two legs. Also, when the market tries to do something twice and fails both times, that is a reliable signal that it will likely\nsucceed in doing the opposite.\n68. Never cherry-pick, because you will invariably pick enough rotten cherries to end up a loser. The good trades catch you by surprise and are\neasy to miss, and you are then left with the not-so-good trades and the bad trades. Either swing trade and look to take only the best two or three\nof the best setups of the day or scalp and take every valid setup. The latter, however, is the more difficult alternative and is only for people with\nvery unusual personalities (even more unusual than the rest of us traders!).\n69. Finding winners is easy, but avoiding losers is hard. The key to success is avoiding the losers. There can be far more winners each day than\nlosers, but a few losers can ruin your day, so learn to spot them in advance and avoid them. Most occur: in the middle of the range with weak\nsetup bars, like small dojis with closes in the middle; when you are entering a possible reversal too early (remember, when in doubt, wait for the\nsecond entry); when you are in denial of a trend and think that it has gone too far so you start taking 1 or 3 minute reversal entries, which turn into\ngreat with-trend setups when they fail (as they invariably will); or, when a very credible, well-credentialed technical analyst from a top firm\nproclaims on TV that the bottom is in, and you then only see buy setups, which invariably fail because the expert in fact is an idiot who cannot\ntrade (if he could, he would be trading and not proclaiming).\n70.

You will not make money trading reversals until you wait for a break of a significant trend line and then for a strong reversal bar on a test of the trend's extreme.\n63. You will not make money unless you know what you are doing. Print out the 5 minute Emini chart every day (and stock charts, if you trade stocks) and write on the chart every setup that you see. When you see several price action features, write them all on the chart. Do this every day for years until you can look at any part of any chart and instantly understand what is happening.\n64. You will not make money in the long term until you know enough about your personality to find a trading style that is compatible. You need to be able to follow your rules comfortably, allowing you to enter and exit trades with minimal or no uncertainty or anxiety. Once you have mastered a method of trading, if you feel stress while trading, then you haven't yet found either your style or yourself.\n65. You will not make money if you lose your discipline and take risky trades in the final couple of hours that you would never take in the first couple of hours. You will invariably give back those earnings from earlier in the day that fooled you into thinking that you are a better trader than you really are.\n66. You are competing against computers. They have the edge of speed, so it is usually best not to trade during a report, because that is when their speed edge is greatest. They also have the edge of not being emotional, so don't trade when you are upset or distracted. Third, they have the edge of never getting tired, so don't trade when you are worn out, which often happens at the end of the day.\n67. Always look for two legs. Also, when the market tries to do something twice and fails both times, that is a reliable signal that it will likely succeed in doing the opposite.\n68. Never cherry-pick, because you will invariably pick enough rotten cherries to end up a loser. The good trades catch you by surprise and are easy to miss, and you are then left with the not-so-good trades and the bad trades. Either swing trade and look to take only the best two or three of the best setups of the day or scalp and take every valid setup. The latter, however, is the more difficult alternative and is only for people with very unusual personalities (even more unusual than the rest of us traders!).\n69. Finding winners is easy, but avoiding losers is hard. The key to success is avoiding the losers. There can be far more winners each day than losers, but a few losers can ruin your day, so learn to spot them in advance and avoid them. Most occur: in the middle of the range with weak setup bars, like small dojis with closes in the middle; when you are entering a possible reversal too early (remember, when in doubt, wait for the second entry); when you are in denial of a trend and think that it has gone too far so you start taking 1 or 3 minute reversal entries, which turn into great with-trend setups when they fail (as they invariably will); or, when a very credible, well-credentialed technical analyst from a top firm proclaims on TV that the bottom is in, and you then only see buy setups, which invariably fail because the expert in fact is an idiot who cannot trade (if he could, he would be trading and not proclaiming).\n70.
