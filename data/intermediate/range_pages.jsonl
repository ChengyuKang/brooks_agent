If at any time you are forced to decide between initiating a long or a short trade and are confident in your choice, then the market is in\nalways-in mode at that moment. Almost all of these trades require a spike in the direction of the trend before traders will have confidence. \nbarbwire A trading range of three or more bars that largely overlap and one or more is a doji. It is a type of tight trading range with prominent\ntails and often relatively large bars. \nbar pullback In an upswing, a bar pullback is a bar with a low below the low of the prior bar. In a downswing, it is a bar with a high above that\nof the prior bar. \nbear reversal A change in trend from up to down (a bear trend). \nblown account An account that your losses have reduced below the minimum margin requirements set by your broker, and you will not be\nallowed to place a trade unless you deposit more money. \nbreakout The high or low of the current bar extends beyond some prior price of significance such as a swing high or low, the high or low of\nany prior bar, a trend line, or a trend channel. \nbreakout bar (or bar breakout) A bar that creates a breakout. It is usually a strong trend bar. \nbreakout mode A setup where a breakout in either direction should have follow-through. \nbreakout pullback A small pullback of one to about five bars that occurs within a few bars after a breakout. Since you see it as a pullback,\nyou are expecting the breakout to resume and the pullback is a setup for that resumption. If instead you thought that the breakout would fail,\nyou would not use the term pullback and instead would see the pullback as a failed breakout. For example, if there was a five-bar breakout\nabove a bear trend line but you believed that the bear trend would continue, you would be considering shorting this bear flag and not looking to\nbuy a pullback immediately after it broke out to the downside. \nbreakout test A breakout pullback that comes close to the original entry price to test a breakeven stop. It may overshoot it or undershoot it by\na few ticks. It can occur within a bar or two of entry or after an extended move or even 20 or more bars later. \nbull reversal A change in trend from a downtrend to an uptrend (a bull trend). \nbuying pressure Strong bulls are asserting themselves and their buying is creating bull trend bars, bars with tails at the bottoms, and two-bar\nbull reversals. The effect is cumulative and usually is eventually followed by higher prices. \ncandle A chart representation of price action in which the body is the area between the open and the close. If the close is above the open, it is\na bull candle and is shown as white. If it is below, it is a bear candle and is black. The lines above and below are called tails (some\ntechnicians call them wicks or shadows). \nchart type A line, bar, candle, volume, tick, or other type of chart. \nclimax A move that has gone too far too fast and has now reversed direction to either a trading range or an opposite trend. Most climaxes\nend with trend channel overshoots and reversals, but most of those reversals result in trading ranges and not an opposite trend. \ncountertrend A trade or setup that is in the opposite direction from the current trend (the current always-in direction). This is a losing strategy\nfor most traders since the risk is usually at least as large as the reward and the probability is rarely high enough to make the trader's equation\nfavorable. \ncountertrend scalp A trade taken in the belief that there is more to go in the trend but that a small pullback is due; you enter countertrend to\ncapture a small profit as that small pullback is forming. This is usually a mistake and should be avoided. \nday trade A trade where the intent is to exit on the day of entry. \ndirectional probability The probability that the market will move either up or down any number of ticks before it reaches a certain number of\nticks in the opposite direction. If you are looking at an equidistant move up and down, it hovers around 50 percent most of the time, which\nmeans that there is a 50–50 chance that the market will move up by X ticks before it moves down X ticks, and a 50–50 chance that it will\nmove down X ticks before it moves up X ticks. \ndoji A candle with a small body or no body at all. On a 5 minute chart, the body would be only one or two ticks; but on a daily chart, the body\nmight be 10 or more ticks and still appear almost nonexistent. Neither the bulls nor the bears control the bar. All bars are either trend bars or\nnontrend bars, and those nontrend bars are called dojis. \ndouble bottom A chart formation in which the low of the current bar is about the same as the low of a prior swing low. That prior low can be\njust one bar earlier or 20 or more bars earlier. It does not have to be at the low of the day, and it commonly forms in bull flags (a double bottom\nbull flag). \ndouble bottom bull flag A pause or bull flag in a bull trend that has two spikes down to around the same price and then reverses back into a\nbull trend. \ndouble bottom pullback A buy setup composed of a double bottom followed by a deep pullback that forms a higher low. \ndouble top A chart formation in which the high of the current bar is about the same as the high of a prior swing high. That prior high can be\njust one bar earlier or 20 or more bars earlier. It does not have to be at the high of the day, and it commonly forms in bear flags (a double top\nbear flag). \ndouble top bear flag A pause or bear flag in a bear trend that has two spikes up to around the same price and then reverses back into a\nbear trend. \ndouble top pullback A sell setup composed of a double top followed by a deep pullback that forms a lower high. \nearly longs Traders who buy as a bull signal bar is forming rather than waiting for it to close and then entering on a buy stop at one tick above\nits high. \nearly shorts Traders who sell as a bear signal bar is forming rather than waiting for it to close and then entering on a sell stop at one tick\nbelow its low. \nedge A setup with a positive trader's equation. The trader has a mathematical advantage if he trades the setup. Edges are always small and\nfleeting because they need someone on the other side, and the market is filled with smart traders who won't allow an edge to be big and\npersistent. \n", "text_clean": "List of Terms Used in This Book All of these terms are defined in a practical way to be helpful to traders and not necessarily in the theoretical way often described by technicians.\nalways in If you have to be in the market at all times, either long or short, this is whatever your current position is (always in long or always in short).

In a downswing, it is a bar with a high above that of the prior bar.\nbear reversal A change in trend from up to down (a bear trend).\nblown account An account that your losses have reduced below the minimum margin requirements set by your broker, and you will not be allowed to place a trade unless you deposit more money.\nbreakout The high or low of the current bar extends beyond some prior price of significance such as a swing high or low, the high or low of any prior bar, a trend line, or a trend channel.\nbreakout bar (or bar breakout) A bar that creates a breakout. It is usually a strong trend bar.\nbreakout mode A setup where a breakout in either direction should have follow-through.\nbreakout pullback A small pullback of one to about five bars that occurs within a few bars after a breakout. Since you see it as a pullback, you are expecting the breakout to resume and the pullback is a setup for that resumption. If instead you thought that the breakout would fail, you would not use the term pullback and instead would see the pullback as a failed breakout. For example, if there was a five-bar breakout above a bear trend line but you believed that the bear trend would continue, you would be considering shorting this bear flag and not looking to buy a pullback immediately after it broke out to the downside.\nbreakout test A breakout pullback that comes close to the original entry price to test a breakeven stop. It may overshoot it or undershoot it by a few ticks. It can occur within a bar or two of entry or after an extended move or even 20 or more bars later.\nbull reversal A change in trend from a downtrend to an uptrend (a bull trend).\nbuying pressure Strong bulls are asserting themselves and their buying is creating bull trend bars, bars with tails at the bottoms, and two-bar bull reversals. The effect is cumulative and usually is eventually followed by higher prices.\ncandle A chart representation of price action in which the body is the area between the open and the close. If the close is above the open, it is a bull candle and is shown as white. If it is below, it is a bear candle and is black. The lines above and below are called tails (some technicians call them wicks or shadows).\nchart type A line, bar, candle, volume, tick, or other type of chart.\nclimax A move that has gone too far too fast and has now reversed direction to either a trading range or an opposite trend. Most climaxes end with trend channel overshoots and reversals, but most of those reversals result in trading ranges and not an opposite trend.\ncountertrend A trade or setup that is in the opposite direction from the current trend (the current always-in direction). This is a losing strategy for most traders since the risk is usually at least as large as the reward and the probability is rarely high enough to make the trader's equation favorable.\ncountertrend scalp A trade taken in the belief that there is more to go in the trend but that a small pullback is due; you enter countertrend to capture a small profit as that small pullback is forming. This is usually a mistake and should be avoided.\nday trade A trade where the intent is to exit on the day of entry.\ndirectional probability The probability that the market will move either up or down any number of ticks before it reaches a certain number of ticks in the opposite direction. If you are looking at an equidistant move up and down, it hovers around 50 percent most of the time, which means that there is a 50–50 chance that the market will move up by X ticks before it moves down X ticks, and a 50–50 chance that it will move down X ticks before it moves up X ticks.\ndoji A candle with a small body or no body at all. On a 5 minute chart, the body would be only one or two ticks; but on a daily chart, the body might be 10 or more ticks and still appear almost nonexistent. Neither the bulls nor the bears control the bar. All bars are either trend bars or nontrend bars, and those nontrend bars are called dojis.\ndouble bottom A chart formation in which the low of the current bar is about the same as the low of a prior swing low. That prior low can be just one bar earlier or 20 or more bars earlier. It does not have to be at the low of the day, and it commonly forms in bull flags (a double bottom bull flag).\ndouble bottom bull flag A pause or bull flag in a bull trend that has two spikes down to around the same price and then reverses back into a bull trend.\ndouble bottom pullback A buy setup composed of a double bottom followed by a deep pullback that forms a higher low.\ndouble top A chart formation in which the high of the current bar is about the same as the high of a prior swing high. That prior high can be just one bar earlier or 20 or more bars earlier. It does not have to be at the high of the day, and it commonly forms in bear flags (a double top bear flag).\ndouble top bear flag A pause or bear flag in a bear trend that has two spikes up to around the same price and then reverses back into a bear trend.\ndouble top pullback A sell setup composed of a double top followed by a deep pullback that forms a lower high.\nearly longs Traders who buy as a bull signal bar is forming rather than waiting for it to close and then entering on a buy stop at one tick above its high.\nearly shorts Traders who sell as a bear signal bar is forming rather than waiting for it to close and then entering on a sell stop at one tick below its low.\nedge A setup with a positive trader's equation.

If there is then a bar with a\nhigher low (it can occur one or several bars later), the next bar in this correction whose low is below the prior bar's low is a low 2. Third and\nfourth occurrences are a low 3 and 4. A low 3 is a wedge bear flag variant. \nmajor trend line Any trend line that contains most of the price action on the screen and is typically drawn using bars that are at least 10 bars\napart. \nmajor trend reversal A reversal from a bull to a bear trend or from a bear trend to a bull trend. The setup must include a test of the old trend\nextreme after a break of the trend line. \nmeltdown A sell-off in a bear spike or a tight bear channel without significant pullbacks and that extends further than the fundamentals would\ndictate. \nmelt-up A rally in a bull spike or a tight bull channel without significant pullbacks and that extends further than the fundamentals would dictate. \nmicro Any traditional pattern can form over one to about five bars and still be valid, although easily overlooked. When it forms, it is a micro\nversion of the pattern. Every micro pattern is a traditional pattern on a smaller time frame chart, and every traditional pattern is a micro pattern\non a higher time frame chart. \nmicro channel A very tight channel where most of the bars have their highs and lows touching the trend line and, often, also the trend channel\nline. It is the most extreme form of a tight channel, and it has no pullbacks or only one or two small pullbacks. \nmicro double bottom Consecutive or nearly consecutive bars with lows that are near the same price. \nmicro double top Consecutive or nearly consecutive bars with highs that are near the same price. \nmicro measuring gap When the bar before and the bar after a strong trend bar do not overlap, this is a sign of strength and often leads to a\nmeasured move. For example, if there is a strong bull trend bar and the low of the bar after it is at or above the high of the bar before it, the\nmidpoint between that low and that high is the micro measuring gap. \nmicro trend channel line A trend channel line drawn across the highs or lows of three to five consecutive bars. \nmicro trend line breakout A trend line on any time frame that is drawn across from two to about 10 bars where most of the bars touch or are\nclose to the trend line, and then one of the bars has a false breakout through the trend line. This false breakout sets up a with-trend entry. If it\nfails within a bar or two, then there is usually a countertrend trade. \nmoney stop A stop based on a fixed dollar amount or number of points, like two points in the Eminis or a dollar in a stock. \nmoving average The charts in this book use a 20-bar exponential moving average, but any moving average can be useful. \nmoving average gap bar (gap bar) A bar that does not touch the moving average. The space between the bar and the moving average is\nthe gap. The first pullback in a strong trend that results in a moving average gap bar is usually followed by a test of the trend's extreme. For\nexample, when there is a strong bull trend and there is a pullback that finally has a bar with a high below the moving average, this is often a buy\nsetup for a test of the high of the trend. \nnesting Sometimes a pattern has a smaller version of a comparable pattern “nested” within it. For example, it is common for the right\nshoulder of a head and shoulders top to be either a small head and shoulders top or a double top. \nnews Useless information generated by the media for the sole purpose of selling advertising and making money for the media company. It is\nunrelated to trading, is impossible to evaluate, and should always be ignored. \noio Outside-inside-outside, an outside bar followed by an inside bar, followed by an outside bar. \noo Outside-outside, an outside bar followed by a larger outside bar. \nopening reversal A reversal in the first hour or so of the day. \noutside bar A bar with a high that is above or at the high of the prior bar and a low that is below the low of the prior bar, or a bar with a low\nthat is below or at the low of the prior bar and a high that is above the high of the prior bar. \noutside down bar An outside bar with a close below its open. \noutside up bar An outside bar with a close above its open. \novershoot The market surpasses a prior price of significance like a swing point or a trend line. \npause bar A bar that does not extend the trend. In a bull trend, a pause bar has a high that is at or below the prior bar, or a small bar with a\nhigh that is only a tick or so higher than the previous bar when the previous bar is a strong bull trend bar. It is a type of pullback. \npip A tick in the foreign exchange (forex) market. However, some data vendors provide quotes with an extra decimal place, which should be\nignored. \npressing their longs In a bull trend, bulls add to their longs as in a bull spike and as the market breaks out to a new high, because they\nexpect another leg up to about a measured move. \npressing their shorts In a bear trend, bears add to their shorts in a bear spike and as the market breaks out to a new low, because they\nexpect another leg down to about a measured move. \nprice action Any change in price on any chart type or time frame. \nprobability The chance of success. For example, if a trader looks back at the most recent 100 times a certain setup led to a trade and finds\nthat it led to a profitable trade 60 times, then that would indicate that the setup has about a 60 percent probability of success. There are many\nvariables that can never be fully tested, so probabilities are only approximations and at times can be very misleading. \nprobably At least 60 percent certain. \npullback A temporary pause or countertrend move that is part of a trend, swing, or leg and does not retrace beyond the start of the trend,\nswing, or leg. It is a small trading range where traders expect the trend to resume soon. For example, a bear pullback is a sideways to upward\nmove in a bear trend, swing, or leg that will be followed by at least a test of the prior low. It can be as small as a one-tick move above the high\nof the prior bar or it can even be a pause, like an inside bar. \npullback bar A bar that reverses the prior bar by at least one tick. In an uptrend, it is a bar with a low below that of the prior bar. \nreasonable A setup with a favorable trader's equation. \nreversal A change to an opposite type of behavior. Most technicians use the term to mean a change from a bull trend to a bear trend or from\na bear trend to a bull trend. However, trading range behavior is opposite to trending behavior, so when a trend becomes a trading range, this\nis also a reversal. When a trading range becomes a trend, it is a reversal but is usually called a breakout. \n", "text_clean": "other futures.\nlower high A swing high that is lower than a previous swing high.\nlower low A swing low that is lower than a previous swing low.\nlow 1, 2, 3, or 4 A low 1 is a bar with a low below the prior bar in a bear flag or near the top of a trading range. If there is then a bar with a higher low (it can occur one or several bars later), the next bar in this correction whose low is below the prior bar's low is a low 2. Third and fourth occurrences are a low 3 and 4. A low 3 is a wedge bear flag variant.\nmajor trend line Any trend line that contains most of the price action on the screen and is typically drawn using bars that are at least 10 bars apart.\nmajor trend reversal A reversal from a bull to a bear trend or from a bear trend to a bull trend. The setup must include a test of the old trend extreme after a break of the trend line.\nmeltdown A sell-off in a bear spike or a tight bear channel without significant pullbacks and that extends further than the fundamentals would dictate.\nmelt-up A rally in a bull spike or a tight bull channel without significant pullbacks and that extends further than the fundamentals would dictate.\nmicro Any traditional pattern can form over one to about five bars and still be valid, although easily overlooked. When it forms, it is a micro version of the pattern. Every micro pattern is a traditional pattern on a smaller time frame chart, and every traditional pattern is a micro pattern on a higher time frame chart.\nmicro channel A very tight channel where most of the bars have their highs and lows touching the trend line and, often, also the trend channel line. It is the most extreme form of a tight channel, and it has no pullbacks or only one or two small pullbacks.\nmicro double bottom Consecutive or nearly consecutive bars with lows that are near the same price.\nmicro double top Consecutive or nearly consecutive bars with highs that are near the same price.\nmicro measuring gap When the bar before and the bar after a strong trend bar do not overlap, this is a sign of strength and often leads to a measured move. For example, if there is a strong bull trend bar and the low of the bar after it is at or above the high of the bar before it, the midpoint between that low and that high is the micro measuring gap.\nmicro trend channel line A trend channel line drawn across the highs or lows of three to five consecutive bars.\nmicro trend line breakout A trend line on any time frame that is drawn across from two to about 10 bars where most of the bars touch or are close to the trend line, and then one of the bars has a false breakout through the trend line. This false breakout sets up a with-trend entry. If it fails within a bar or two, then there is usually a countertrend trade.\nmoney stop A stop based on a fixed dollar amount or number of points, like two points in the Eminis or a dollar in a stock.\nmoving average The charts in this book use a 20-bar exponential moving average, but any moving average can be useful.\nmoving average gap bar (gap bar) A bar that does not touch the moving average. The space between the bar and the moving average is the gap. The first pullback in a strong trend that results in a moving average gap bar is usually followed by a test of the trend's extreme. For example, when there is a strong bull trend and there is a pullback that finally has a bar with a high below the moving average, this is often a buy setup for a test of the high of the trend.\nnesting Sometimes a pattern has a smaller version of a comparable pattern “nested” within it. For example, it is common for the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top to be either a small head and shoulders top or a double top.\nnews Useless information generated by the media for the sole purpose of selling advertising and making money for the media company. It is unrelated to trading, is impossible to evaluate, and should always be ignored.\noio Outside-inside-outside, an outside bar followed by an inside bar, followed by an outside bar.\noo Outside-outside, an outside bar followed by a larger outside bar.\nopening reversal A reversal in the first hour or so of the day.\noutside bar A bar with a high that is above or at the high of the prior bar and a low that is below the low of the prior bar, or a bar with a low that is below or at the low of the prior bar and a high that is above the high of the prior bar.\noutside down bar An outside bar with a close below its open.\noutside up bar An outside bar with a close above its open.\novershoot The market surpasses a prior price of significance like a swing point or a trend line.\npause bar A bar that does not extend the trend. In a bull trend, a pause bar has a high that is at or below the prior bar, or a small bar with a high that is only a tick or so higher than the previous bar when the previous bar is a strong bull trend bar. It is a type of pullback.\npip A tick in the foreign exchange (forex) market. However, some data vendors provide quotes with an extra decimal place, which should be ignored.\npressing their longs In a bull trend, bulls add to their longs as in a bull spike and as the market breaks out to a new high, because they expect another leg up to about a measured move.\npressing their shorts In a bear trend, bears add to their shorts in a bear spike and as the market breaks out to a new low, because they expect another leg down to about a measured move.\nprice action Any change in price on any chart type or time frame.\nprobability The chance of success. For example, if a trader looks back at the most recent 100 times a certain setup led to a trade and finds that it led to a profitable trade 60 times, then that would indicate that the setup has about a 60 percent probability of success. There are many variables that can never be fully tested, so probabilities are only approximations and at times can be very misleading.\nprobably At least 60 percent certain.\npullback A temporary pause or countertrend move that is part of a trend, swing, or leg and does not retrace beyond the start of the trend, swing, or leg. It is a small trading range where traders expect the trend to resume soon. For example, a bear pullback is a sideways to upward move in a bear trend, swing, or leg that will be followed by at least a test of the prior low. It can be as small as a one-tick move above the high of the prior bar or it can even be a pause, like an inside bar.\npullback bar A bar that reverses the prior bar by at least one tick. In an uptrend, it is a bar with a low below that of the prior bar.\nreasonable A setup with a favorable trader's equation.\nreversal A change to an opposite type of behavior. Most technicians use the term to mean a change from a bull trend to a bear trend or from a bear trend to a bull trend.

When a bear leg is reversing up, a bull reversal bar is a bull trend bar, and the\nclassic description includes a tail at the bottom and a close above the open and near the top. A bear reversal bar is a bear trend bar in a bull\nleg, and the traditional description includes a tail at the top and a close below the open and near the bottom. \nreward The number of ticks that a trader expects to make from a trade. For example, if the trader exits with a limit order at a profit target, it is\nthe number of ticks between the entry price and the profit target. \nrisk The number of ticks from a trader's entry price to a protective stop. It is the minimum that the trader will lose if a trade goes against him\n(slippage and other factors can make the actual risk greater than the theoretical risk). \nrisk off When traders think that the stock market will fall, they become risk averse, sell out of volatile stocks and currencies, and transition into\nsafe-haven investments, like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Altria Group (MO), Procter & Gamble (PG), the U.S. dollar, and the Swiss franc. \nrisk on When traders think that the stock market is strong, they are willing to take more risks and invest in stocks that tend to rise faster than\nthe overall market, and invest in more volatile currencies, like the Australian dollar or the Swedish krona. \nrisky When the trader's equation is unclear or barely favorable for a trade. It can also mean that the probability of success for a trade is 50\npercent or less, regardless of the risk and potential reward. \nscalp A trade that is exited with a small profit, usually before there are any pullbacks. In the Emini, when the average range is about 10 to 15\npoints, a scalp trade is usually any trade where the goal is less than four points. For the SPY or stocks, it might be 10 to 30 cents. For more\nexpensive stocks, it can be $1 to $2. Since the profit is often smaller than the risk, a trader has to win at least 70 percent of the time, which is\nan unrealistic goal for most traders. Traders should take trades only where the potential reward is at least as great as the risk unless they are\nextremely skilled. \nscalper A trader who primarily scalps for small profits, usually using a tight stop. \nscalper's profit A typical amount of profit that a scalper would be targeting. \nscratch A trade that is close to breakeven with either a small profit or a loss. \nsecond entry The second time within a few bars of the first entry where there is an entry bar based on the same logic as the first entry. For\nexample, if a breakout above a wedge bull flag fails and pulls back to a double bottom bull flag, this pullback sets up a second buy signal for\nthe wedge bull flag. \nsecond moving average gap bar setup If there is a first moving average gap bar and a reversal toward the moving average does not\nreach the moving average, and instead the move away from the moving average continues, it is the next reversal in the direction of the moving\naverage. \nsecond signal The second time within a few bars of the first signal where there is a setup based on the same logic as the first signal. \nselling pressure Strong bears are asserting themselves and their selling is creating bear trend bars, bars with tails at the tops, and two-bar\nbear reversals. The effect is cumulative and usually is eventually followed by lower prices. \nsetup A pattern of one or more bars used by traders as the basis to place entry orders. If an entry order is filled, the last bar of the setup\nbecomes the signal bar. Most setups are just a single bar. \nshaved body A candle with no tail at one or both ends. A shaved top has no tail at the top and a shaved bottom has no tail at the bottom. \nshort As a verb, to sell a stock or futures contract to initiate a new position (not to exit a prior purchase). As a noun, a person who sells\nsomething short, or the actual position itself. \nshrinking stairs A stairs pattern where the most recent breakout is smaller than the previous one. It is a series of three or more trending\nhighs in a bull trend or lows in a bear trend where each breakout to a new extreme is by fewer ticks than the prior breakout, indicating waning\nmomentum. It can be a three-push pattern, but it does not have to resemble a wedge and can be any series of broad swings in a trend. \nsignal bar The bar immediately before the bar in which an entry order is filled (the entry bar). It is the final bar of a setup. \nsmaller time frame (STF) A chart covering the same amount of time as the current chart, but having more bars.

After the breakout, there is a breakout pullback that\nretraces at least slightly into the prior trading range, which is not a requirement of other trending trading ranges. Two-way trading is taking\nplace but one side is in slightly more control, accounting for the slope. \nSTF See smaller time frame (STF). \nstrong bulls and bears Institutional traders and their cumulative buying and selling determine the direction of the market. \nsuccess Refers to traders achieving their objective. Their profit target was reached before their protective stop was hit. \nswing A smaller trend that breaks a trend line of any size; the term is used only when there are at least two on the chart. They can occur within\na larger trend or in a sideways market. \nswing high A bar that looks like a spike up on the chart and extends up beyond the neighboring bars. Its high is at or above that of the bar\nbefore it and that of the bar after it. \nswing high/low Either a swing high or a swing low. \nswing low A bar that looks like a spike down on the chart and extends down beyond the neighboring bars. Its low is at or below that of the bar\nbefore it and that of the bar after it. \nswing point Either a swing high or a swing low. \nswing trade For a day trader using a short-term intraday chart like the 5 minute, it is any trade that lasts longer than a scalp and that the\ntrader will hold through one or more pullbacks. For a trader using higher time frame charts, it is a trade that lasts for hours to several days.\nTypically, at least part of the trade is held without a profit target, since the trader is hoping for an extended move.

Most traders believe that if the market then reverses, the test was successful, and if it does not and\nthe move continues beyond the test area, the test failed and a breakout has occurred. \nthree pushes Three swing highs where each swing high is usually higher or three swing lows where each swing low is usually lower. It trades\nthe same as a wedge and should be considered a variant. When it is part of a flag, the move can be mostly horizontal and each push does not\nhave to extend beyond the prior one. For example, in a wedge bull flag or any other type of triangle, the second push down can be at, above,\nor below the first, and the third push down can be at, above, or below either the second or the first, or both. \ntick The smallest unit of price movement. For most stocks, it is one penny; for 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures, it is 1/64th of a point; and\nfor Eminis, it is 0.25 points. On tick charts and on time and sales tables, a tick is every trade that takes place no matter the size and even if\nthere is no price change. If you look at a time and sales table, every trade is counted as one tick when TradeStation charting software creates\na tick chart. \ntight channel A channel where the trend line and trend channel line are close together, and the pullbacks are small and last for only one to\nthree bars. \ntight trading range A trading range of two or more bars with lots of overlap in the bars and in which most reversals are too small to trade\nprofitably with stop entries. The bulls and bears are in balance. \ntime frame The length of time contained in one bar on the chart (a 5 minute time frame is made of bars that close every five minutes). It can\nalso refer to bars not based on time, such as those based on volume or the number of ticks traded. \ntradable A setup that you believe has a reasonable chance of leading to at least a scalper's profit. \ntrader's equation To take a trade, you must believe that the probability of success times the potential reward is greater than the probability of\nfailure times the risk. You set the reward and risk because the potential reward is the distance to your profit target and the risk is the distance\nto your stop. The difficulty in solving the equation is assigning a value to the probability, which can never be known with certainty. As a\nguideline, if you are uncertain, assume that you have a 50 percent chance of winning or losing, and if you are confident, assume that you have\na 60 percent chance of winning and a 40 percent chance of losing. \ntrading range The minimum requirement is a single bar with a range that is largely overlapped by the bar before it. It is sideways movement\nand neither the bull nor the bears are in control, although one side is often stronger. It is often a pullback in a trend where the pullback has\nlasted long enough to lose most of its certainty. In other words, traders have become uncertain about the direction of the breakout in the short\nterm, and the market will have repeated breakout attempts up and down that will fail. It will usually ultimately break out in the direction of the\ntrend, and is a pullback on a higher time frame chart. \ntrailing a stop As the trade becomes increasingly profitable, traders will often move, or trail, the protective stop to protect more of their open\nprofit. For example, if they are long in a bull trend, every time the market moves to a new high, they might raise the protective stop to just below\nthe most recent higher low. \ntrap An entry that immediately reverses to the opposite direction before a scalper's profit target is reached, trapping traders in their new\nposition and ultimately forcing them to cover at a loss. It can also scare traders out of a good trade. \ntrapped in a trade A trader with an open loss on a trade that did not result in a scalper's profit, and if there is a pullback beyond the entry or\nsignal bars, the trader will likely exit with a loss. \ntrapped out of a trade A pullback that scares a trader into exiting a trade, but then the pullback fails. The move quickly resumes in the\ndirection of the trade, making it difficult emotionally for the trader to get back in at the worse price that is now available. The trader will have to\nchase the market. \ntrend A series of price changes that are either mostly up (a bull trend) or down (a bear trend). There are three loosely defined smaller\nversions: swings, legs, and pullbacks. A chart will show only one or two major trends. If there are more, one of the other terms is more\nappropriate. \ntrend bar A bar with a body, which means that the close was above or below the open, indicating that there is at least a minor price\nmovement. \ntrend channel line A line in the direction of the trend but drawn on the opposite side of the bars compared to a trend line. A bull trend channel\nline is above the highs and rising to the right, and a bear trend channel line is below the lows and falling to the right. \ntrend channel line overshoot One or more bars penetrating a trend channel line. \ntrend channel line undershoot A bar approaches a trend channel line but the market reverses away from the line without reaching or\npenetrating it. \ntrend from the open A trend that begins at the first or one of the first bars of the day and extends for many bars without a pullback, and the\nstart of the trend remains as one of the extremes of the day for much if not all of the day. \ntrending closes Three or more bars where the closes are trending. In a bull trend, each close is above the prior close, and in a bear trend,\neach close is lower. If the pattern extends for many bars, there can be one or two bars where the closes are not trending. \ntrending highs or lows The same as trending closes except based on the highs or lows of the bars. \ntrending swings Three or more swings where the swing highs and lows are both higher than the prior swing highs and lows (trending bull\nswings), or both lower (trending bear swings). \ntrending trading ranges Two or more trading ranges separated by a breakout. \ntrend line A line drawn in the direction of the trend; it is sloped up and is below the bars in a bull trend, and it is sloped down and is above the\nbars in a bear trend. Most often, it is constructed from either swing highs or swing lows but can be based on linear regression or just a best fit\n(eyeballing). \ntrend reversal A trend change from up to down or down to up, or from a trend to a trading range. \n20 moving average gap bars Twenty or more consecutive bars that have not touched the moving average. Once the market finally touches\nthe moving average, it usually creates a setup for a test of the trend's extreme. \nundershoot The market approaches but does not reach a prior price of significance like a swing point or a trend line. \nunlikely At most 40 percent certain. \nunreasonable A setup with an unfavorable trader's equation. \nusually At least 60 percent certain. \nvacuum A buy vacuum occurs when the strong bears believe that the price will soon be higher so they wait to short until it reaches some\nmagnet above the market. The result is that there is a vacuum that sucks the market quickly up to the magnet in the form of one or more bull\ntrend bars.

Most traders believe that if the market then reverses, the test was successful, and if it does not and the move continues beyond the test area, the test failed and a breakout has occurred.\nthree pushes Three swing highs where each swing high is usually higher or three swing lows where each swing low is usually lower. It trades the same as a wedge and should be considered a variant. When it is part of a flag, the move can be mostly horizontal and each push does not have to extend beyond the prior one. For example, in a wedge bull flag or any other type of triangle, the second push down can be at, above, or below the first, and the third push down can be at, above, or below either the second or the first, or both.\ntick The smallest unit of price movement. For most stocks, it is one penny; for 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures, it is 1/64th of a point; and for Eminis, it is 0.25 points. On tick charts and on time and sales tables, a tick is every trade that takes place no matter the size and even if there is no price change. If you look at a time and sales table, every trade is counted as one tick when TradeStation charting software creates a tick chart.\ntight channel A channel where the trend line and trend channel line are close together, and the pullbacks are small and last for only one to three bars.\ntight trading range A trading range of two or more bars with lots of overlap in the bars and in which most reversals are too small to trade profitably with stop entries. The bulls and bears are in balance.\ntime frame The length of time contained in one bar on the chart (a 5 minute time frame is made of bars that close every five minutes). It can also refer to bars not based on time, such as those based on volume or the number of ticks traded.\ntradable A setup that you believe has a reasonable chance of leading to at least a scalper's profit.\ntrader's equation To take a trade, you must believe that the probability of success times the potential reward is greater than the probability of failure times the risk. You set the reward and risk because the potential reward is the distance to your profit target and the risk is the distance to your stop. The difficulty in solving the equation is assigning a value to the probability, which can never be known with certainty. As a guideline, if you are uncertain, assume that you have a 50 percent chance of winning or losing, and if you are confident, assume that you have a 60 percent chance of winning and a 40 percent chance of losing.\ntrading range The minimum requirement is a single bar with a range that is largely overlapped by the bar before it. It is sideways movement and neither the bull nor the bears are in control, although one side is often stronger. It is often a pullback in a trend where the pullback has lasted long enough to lose most of its certainty. In other words, traders have become uncertain about the direction of the breakout in the short term, and the market will have repeated breakout attempts up and down that will fail. It will usually ultimately break out in the direction of the trend, and is a pullback on a higher time frame chart.\ntrailing a stop As the trade becomes increasingly profitable, traders will often move, or trail, the protective stop to protect more of their open profit. For example, if they are long in a bull trend, every time the market moves to a new high, they might raise the protective stop to just below the most recent higher low.\ntrap An entry that immediately reverses to the opposite direction before a scalper's profit target is reached, trapping traders in their new position and ultimately forcing them to cover at a loss. It can also scare traders out of a good trade.\ntrapped in a trade A trader with an open loss on a trade that did not result in a scalper's profit, and if there is a pullback beyond the entry or signal bars, the trader will likely exit with a loss.\ntrapped out of a trade A pullback that scares a trader into exiting a trade, but then the pullback fails. The move quickly resumes in the direction of the trade, making it difficult emotionally for the trader to get back in at the worse price that is now available. The trader will have to chase the market.\ntrend A series of price changes that are either mostly up (a bull trend) or down (a bear trend). There are three loosely defined smaller versions: swings, legs, and pullbacks. A chart will show only one or two major trends. If there are more, one of the other terms is more appropriate.\ntrend bar A bar with a body, which means that the close was above or below the open, indicating that there is at least a minor price movement.\ntrend channel line A line in the direction of the trend but drawn on the opposite side of the bars compared to a trend line. A bull trend channel line is above the highs and rising to the right, and a bear trend channel line is below the lows and falling to the right.\ntrend channel line overshoot One or more bars penetrating a trend channel line.\ntrend channel line undershoot A bar approaches a trend channel line but the market reverses away from the line without reaching or penetrating it.\ntrend from the open A trend that begins at the first or one of the first bars of the day and extends for many bars without a pullback, and the start of the trend remains as one of the extremes of the day for much if not all of the day.\ntrending closes Three or more bars where the closes are trending. In a bull trend, each close is above the prior close, and in a bear trend, each close is lower. If the pattern extends for many bars, there can be one or two bars where the closes are not trending.\ntrending highs or lows The same as trending closes except based on the highs or lows of the bars.\ntrending swings Three or more swings where the swing highs and lows are both higher than the prior swing highs and lows (trending bull swings), or both lower (trending bear swings).\ntrending trading ranges Two or more trading ranges separated by a breakout.\ntrend line A line drawn in the direction of the trend; it is sloped up and is below the bars in a bull trend, and it is sloped down and is above the bars in a bear trend. Most often, it is constructed from either swing highs or swing lows but can be based on linear regression or just a best fit (eyeballing).\ntrend reversal A trend change from up to down or down to up, or from a trend to a trading range.\n20 moving average gap bars Twenty or more consecutive bars that have not touched the moving average.

It takes thousands of hours, and the financial\nreward is meager compared to that from trading. However, with my three girls now away in grad school, I have a void to fill and this has been a very\nsatisfying project. I originally planned on updating the first edition of Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar (John Wiley & Sons, 2009), but as I got into\nit, I decided instead to go into great detail about how I view and trade the markets. I am metaphorically teaching you how to play the violin.\nEverything you need to know to make a living at it is in these books, but it is up to you to spend the countless hours learning your trade. After a year\nof answering thousands of questions from traders on my website at www.brookspriceaction.com, I think that I have found ways to express my ideas\nmuch more clearly, and these books should be easier to read than that one. The earlier book focused on reading price action, and this series of\nbooks is instead centered on how to use price action to trade the markets. Since the book grew to more than four times as many words as the first\nbook, John Wiley & Sons decided to divide it into three separate books. This first book covers price action basics and trends. The second book is\non trading ranges, order management, and the mathematics of trading, and the final book is about trend reversals, day trading, daily charts,\noptions, and the best setups for all time frames. Many of the charts are also in Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar, but most have been updated and\nthe discussion about the charts has also been largely rewritten. Only about 5 percent of the 120,000 words from that book are present in the\n570,000 words in this new series, so readers will find little duplication.\nMy goals in writing this series of three books are to describe my understanding of why the carefully selected trades offer great risk/reward ratios,\nand to present ways to profit from the setups. I am presenting material that I hope will be interesting to professional traders and students in\nbusiness school, but I also hope that even traders starting out will find some useful ideas. Everyone looks at price charts but usually just briefly and\nwith a specific or limited goal. However, every chart has an incredible amount of information that can be used to make profitable trades, but much\nof it can be used effectively only if traders spend time to carefully understand what each bar on the chart is telling them about what institutional\nmoney is doing.\nNinety percent or more of all trading in large markets is done by institutions, which means that the market is simply a collection of institutions.\nAlmost all are profitable over time, and the few that are not soon go out of business. Since institutions are profitable and they are the market, every\ntrade that you take has a profitable trader (a part of the collection of institutions) taking the other side of your trade. No trade can take place without\none institution willing to take one side and another willing to take the other. The small-volume trades made by individuals can only take place if an\ninstitution is willing to take the same trade. If you want to buy at a certain price, the market will not get to that price unless one or more institutions\nalso want to buy at that price. You cannot sell at any price unless one or more institutions are willing to sell there, because the market can only go to\na price where there are institutions willing to buy and others willing to sell. If the Emini is at 1,264 and you are long with a protective sell stop at\n1,262, your stop cannot get hit unless there is an institution who is also willing to sell at 1,262. This is true for virtually all trades.\nIf you trade 200 Emini contracts, then you are trading institutional volume and are effectively an institution, and you will sometimes be able to\nmove the market a tick or two. Most individual traders, however, have no ability to move the market, no matter how stupidly they are willing to trade.\nThe market will not run your stops. The market might test the price where your protective stop is, but it has nothing to do with your stop. It will only\ntest that price if one or more institutions believe that it is financially sound to sell there and other institutions believe that it is profitable to buy there.\nAt every tick, there are institutions buying and other institutions selling, and all have proven systems that will make money by placing those trades.\nYou should always be trading in the direction of the majority of institutional dollars because they control where the market is heading.\nAt the end of the day when you look at a printout of the day's chart, how can you tell what the institutions did during the day? The answer is simple:\nwhenever the market went up, the bulk of institutional money was buying, and whenever the market went down, more money went into selling. Just\nlook at any segment of the chart where the market went up or down and study every bar, and you will soon notice many repeatable patterns. With\ntime, you will begin to see those patterns unfold in real time, and that will give you confidence to place your trades. Some of the price action is\nsubtle, so be open to every possibility. For example, sometimes when the market is working higher, a bar will trade below the low of the prior bar,\nyet the trend continues higher. You have to assume that the big money was buying at and below the low of that prior bar, and that is also what many\nexperienced traders were doing. They bought exactly where weak traders let themselves get stopped out with a loss or where other weak traders\nshorted, believing that the market was beginning to sell off. Once you get comfortable with the idea that strong trends often have pullbacks and big\nmoney is buying them rather than selling them, you will be in a position to make some great trades that you previously thought were exactly the\nwrong thing to do. Don't think too hard about it. If the market is going up, institutions are buying constantly, even at times when you think that you\nshould stop yourself out of your long with a loss. Your job is to follow their behavior and not use too much logic to deny what is happening right in\nfront of you. It does not matter if it seems counterintuitive. All that matters is that the market is going up and therefore institutions are predominantly\nbuying and so should you.\nInstitutions are generally considered to be smart money, meaning that they are smart enough to make a living by trading and they trade a large\nvolume every day. Television still uses the term institution to refer to traditional institutions like mutual funds, banks, brokerage houses, insurance\ncompanies, pension funds, and hedge funds; these companies used to account for most of the volume, and they mostly trade on fundamentals.\nTheir trading controls the direction of the market on daily and weekly charts and a lot of the big intraday swings. Until a decade or so ago, most of\nthe trade decisions were made and most trading was done by very smart traders, but it is now increasingly being done by computers. They have\nprograms that can instantly analyze economic data and immediately place trades based on that analysis, without a person ever being involved in\nthe trade. In addition, other firms trade huge volumes by using computer programs that place trades based on the statistical analysis of price\naction. Computer-generated trading now accounts for as much as 70 percent of the day's volume.\nComputers are very good at making decisions, and playing chess and winning at Jeopardy! are more difficult than trading stocks. Gary\nKasparov for years made the best chess decisions in the world, yet a computer made better decisions in 1997 and beat him. Ken Jennings was\nheralded as the greatest Jeopardy! player of all time, yet a computer destroyed him in 2011. It is only a matter of time before computers are widely\naccepted as the best decision makers for institutional trading.\nSince programs use objective mathematical analysis, there should be a tendency for support and resistance areas to become more clearly\ndefined. For example, measured move projections should become more precise as more of the volume is traded based on precise mathematical\nlogic. Also, there might be a tendency toward more protracted tight channels as programs buy small pullbacks on the daily chart. However, if\nenough programs exit longs or go short at the same key levels, sell-offs might become larger and faster. Will the changes be dramatic? Probably\nnot, since the same general forces were operating when everything was done manually, but nonetheless there should be some move toward\nmathematical perfection as more of the emotion is removed from trading. As these other firms contribute more and more to the movement of the\n", "text_clean": "Introduction There is a reason why there is no other comprehensive book about price action written by a trader.

Computer-generated trading now accounts for as much as 70 percent of the day's volume.\nComputers are very good at making decisions, and playing chess and winning at Jeopardy! are more difficult than trading stocks. Gary Kasparov for years made the best chess decisions in the world, yet a computer made better decisions in 1997 and beat him. Ken Jennings was heralded as the greatest Jeopardy! player of all time, yet a computer destroyed him in 2011. It is only a matter of time before computers are widely accepted as the best decision makers for institutional trading.\nSince programs use objective mathematical analysis, there should be a tendency for support and resistance areas to become more clearly defined. For example, measured move projections should become more precise as more of the volume is traded based on precise mathematical logic. Also, there might be a tendency toward more protracted tight channels as programs buy small pullbacks on the daily chart. However, if enough programs exit longs or go short at the same key levels, sell-offs might become larger and faster. Will the changes be dramatic? Probably not, since the same general forces were operating when everything was done manually, but nonetheless there should be some move toward mathematical perfection as more of the emotion is removed from trading.

No, because the institutions control the\nmarket and they already have the smartest traders in the world and those traders already know everything in these books, at least intuitively. At\nevery moment, there is an extremely smart institutional bull taking the opposite side of the trade being placed by an extremely smart institutional\nbear. Since the most important players already know price action, having more players know it will not tip the balance one way or the other. I\ntherefore have no concern that what I am writing will stop price action from working. Because of that balance, any edge that anyone has is always\ngoing to be extremely small, and any small mistake will result in a loss, no matter how well a person reads a chart. Although it is very difficult to\nmake money as a trader without understanding price action, that knowledge alone is not enough. It takes a long time to learn how to trade after a\ntrader learns to read charts, and trading is just as difficult as chart reading. I wrote these books to help people learn to read charts better and to\ntrade better, and if you can do both well, you deserve to be able to take money from the accounts of others and put it into yours.\nThe reason why the patterns that we all see do unfold as they do is because that is the appearance that occurs in an efficient market with\ncountless traders placing orders for thousands of different reasons, but with the controlling volume being traded based on sound logic. That is just\nwhat it looks like, and it has been that way forever. The same patterns unfold in all time frames in all markets around the world, and it would simply\nbe impossible for all of it to be manipulated instantaneously on so many different levels. Price action is a manifestation of human behavior and\ntherefore actually has a genetic basis. Until we evolve, it will likely remain largely unchanged, just as it has been unchanged for the 80 years of\ncharts that I have reviewed. Program trading might have changed the appearance slightly, although I can find no evidence to support that theory. If\nanything, it would make the charts smoother because it is unemotional and it has greatly increased the volume. Now that most of the volume is\nbeing traded automatically by computers and the volume is so huge, irrational and emotional behavior is an insignificant component of the markets\nand the charts are a purer expression of human tendencies.\nSince price action comes from our DNA, it will not change until we evolve. When you look at the two charts in Figure I.1, your first reaction is that\nthey are just a couple of ordinary charts, but look at the dates at the bottom. These weekly Dow Jones Industrial Average charts from the\nDepression era and from World War II have the same patterns that we see today on all charts, despite most of today's volume being traded by\ncomputers.\nFigure I.1 Price Action Has Not Changed over Time\nIf everyone suddenly became a price action scalper, the smaller patterns might change a little for a while, but over time, the efficient market will\nwin out and the votes by all traders will get distilled into standard price action patterns because that is the inescapable result of countless people\nbehaving logically. Also, the reality is that it is very difficult to trade well, and although basing trades on price action is a sound approach, it is still\nvery difficult to do successfully in real time. There just won't be enough traders doing it well enough, all at the same time, to have any significant\ninfluence over time on the patterns. Just look at Edwards and Magee. The best traders in the world have been using those ideas for decades and\nthey continue to work, again for the same reason—charts look the way they do because that is the unchangeable fingerprint of an efficient market\nfilled with a huge number of smart people using a huge number of approaches and time frames, all trying to make the most money that they can.\nFor example, Tiger Woods is not hiding anything that he does in golf, and anyone is free to copy him. However, very few people can play golf well\nenough to make a living at it. The same is true of trading. A trader can know just about everything there is to know and still lose money because\napplying all that knowledge in a way that consistently makes money is very difficult to do.\nWhy do so many business schools continue to recommend Edwards and Magee when their book is essentially simplistic, largely using trend\nlines, breakouts, and pullbacks as the basis for trading? It is because it works and it always has and it always will. Now that just about all traders\nhave computers with access to intraday data, many of those techniques can be adapted to day trading. Also, candle charts give additional\ninformation about who is controlling the market, which results in a more timely entry with smaller risk. Edwards and Magee's focus is on the overall\ntrend. I use those same basic techniques but pay much closer attention to the individual bars on the chart to improve the risk/reward ratio, and I\ndevote considerable attention to intraday charts.\nIt seemed obvious to me that if one could simply read the charts well enough to be able to enter at the exact times when the move would take off\nand not come back, then that trader would have a huge advantage. The trader would have a high winning percentage, and the few losses would be\nsmall. I decided that this would be my starting point, and what I discovered was that nothing had to be added. In fact, any additions are distractions\nthat result in lower profitability. This sounds so obvious and easy that it is difficult for most people to believe.\nI am a day trader who relies entirely on price action on the intraday Emini S&P 500 Futures charts, and I believe that reading price action well is\nan invaluable skill for all traders. Beginners often instead have a deep-seated belief that something more is required, that maybe some complex\nmathematical formula that very few use would give them just the edge that they need. Goldman Sachs is so rich and sophisticated that its traders\nmust have a supercomputer and high-powered software that gives them an advantage that ensures that all the individual traders are doomed to\nfailure. They start looking at all kinds of indicators and playing with the inputs to customize the indicators to make them just right. Every indicator\nworks some of the time, but for me, they obfuscate instead of elucidate. In fact, without even looking at a chart, you can place a buy order and have\n", "text_clean": "them into the red and make them too scared to continue using that approach.\nShould you be concerned that making the information in these books available will create lots of great price action traders, all doing the same thing at the same time, thereby removing the late entrants needed to drive the market to your price target?

It takes a long time to learn how to trade after a trader learns to read charts, and trading is just as difficult as chart reading. I wrote these books to help people learn to read charts better and to trade better, and if you can do both well, you deserve to be able to take money from the accounts of others and put it into yours.\nThe reason why the patterns that we all see do unfold as they do is because that is the appearance that occurs in an efficient market with countless traders placing orders for thousands of different reasons, but with the controlling volume being traded based on sound logic. That is just what it looks like, and it has been that way forever. The same patterns unfold in all time frames in all markets around the world, and it would simply be impossible for all of it to be manipulated instantaneously on so many different levels. Price action is a manifestation of human behavior and therefore actually has a genetic basis. Until we evolve, it will likely remain largely unchanged, just as it has been unchanged for the 80 years of charts that I have reviewed. Program trading might have changed the appearance slightly, although I can find no evidence to support that theory. If anything, it would make the charts smoother because it is unemotional and it has greatly increased the volume. Now that most of the volume is being traded automatically by computers and the volume is so huge, irrational and emotional behavior is an insignificant component of the markets and the charts are a purer expression of human tendencies.\nSince price action comes from our DNA, it will not change until we evolve. When you look at the two charts in Figure I.1, your first reaction is that they are just a couple of ordinary charts, but look at the dates at the bottom. These weekly Dow Jones Industrial Average charts from the Depression era and from World War II have the same patterns that we see today on all charts, despite most of today's volume being traded by computers.\nFigure I.1 Price Action Has Not Changed over Time If everyone suddenly became a price action scalper, the smaller patterns might change a little for a while, but over time, the efficient market will win out and the votes by all traders will get distilled into standard price action patterns because that is the inescapable result of countless people behaving logically. Also, the reality is that it is very difficult to trade well, and although basing trades on price action is a sound approach, it is still very difficult to do successfully in real time. There just won't be enough traders doing it well enough, all at the same time, to have any significant influence over time on the patterns. Just look at Edwards and Magee. The best traders in the world have been using those ideas for decades and they continue to work, again for the same reason—charts look the way they do because that is the unchangeable fingerprint of an efficient market filled with a huge number of smart people using a huge number of approaches and time frames, all trying to make the most money that they can.\nFor example, Tiger Woods is not hiding anything that he does in golf, and anyone is free to copy him. However, very few people can play golf well enough to make a living at it. The same is true of trading. A trader can know just about everything there is to know and still lose money because applying all that knowledge in a way that consistently makes money is very difficult to do.\nWhy do so many business schools continue to recommend Edwards and Magee when their book is essentially simplistic, largely using trend lines, breakouts, and pullbacks as the basis for trading? It is because it works and it always has and it always will. Now that just about all traders have computers with access to intraday data, many of those techniques can be adapted to day trading. Also, candle charts give additional information about who is controlling the market, which results in a more timely entry with smaller risk. Edwards and Magee's focus is on the overall trend. I use those same basic techniques but pay much closer attention to the individual bars on the chart to improve the risk/reward ratio, and I devote considerable attention to intraday charts.\nIt seemed obvious to me that if one could simply read the charts well enough to be able to enter at the exact times when the move would take off and not come back, then that trader would have a huge advantage. The trader would have a high winning percentage, and the few losses would be small. I decided that this would be my starting point, and what I discovered was that nothing had to be added. In fact, any additions are distractions that result in lower profitability. This sounds so obvious and easy that it is difficult for most people to believe.\nI am a day trader who relies entirely on price action on the intraday Emini S&P 500 Futures charts, and I believe that reading price action well is an invaluable skill for all traders. Beginners often instead have a deep-seated belief that something more is required, that maybe some complex mathematical formula that very few use would give them just the edge that they need. Goldman Sachs is so rich and sophisticated that its traders must have a supercomputer and high-powered software that gives them an advantage that ensures that all the individual traders are doomed to failure. They start looking at all kinds of indicators and playing with the inputs to customize the indicators to make them just right.

Almost every bar offers important clues as to where the market is going, and a trader who dismisses any activity as noise is passing up\nmany profitable trades each day. Most of the observations in these books are directly related to placing trades, but a few have to do with simple\ncurious price action tendencies without sufficient dependability to be the basis for a trade.\nI personally rely mainly on candle charts for my Emini, futures, and stock trading, but most signals are also visible on any type of chart and many\nare even evident on simple line charts. I focus primarily on 5 minute candle charts to illustrate basic principles but also discuss daily and weekly\ncharts as well. Since I also trade stocks, forex, Treasury note futures, and options, I discuss how price action can be used as the basis for this type\nof trading.\nAs a trader, I see everything in shades of gray and am constantly thinking in terms of probabilities. If a pattern is setting up and is not perfect but\nis reasonably similar to a reliable setup, it will likely behave similarly as well. Close is usually close enough. If something resembles a textbook\nsetup, the trade will likely unfold in a way that is similar to the trade from the textbook setup. This is the art of trading and it takes years to become\ngood at trading in the gray zone. Everyone wants concrete, clear rules or indicators, and chat rooms, newsletters, hotlines, or tutors that will tell them\nwhen exactly to get in to minimize risk and maximize profit, but none of it works in the long run. You have to take responsibility for your decisions,\nbut you first have to learn how to make them and that means that you have to get used to operating in the gray fog. Nothing is ever as clear as black\nand white, and I have been doing this long enough to appreciate that anything, no matter how unlikely, can and will happen. It's like quantum physics.\nEvery conceivable event has a probability, and so do events that you have yet to consider. It is not emotional, and the reasons why something\nhappens are irrelevant. Watching to see if the Federal Reserve cuts rates today is a waste of time because there is both a bullish and bearish\ninterpretation of anything that the Fed does. What is key is to see what the market does, not what the Fed does.\nIf you think about it, trading is a zero-sum game and it is impossible to have a zero-sum game where rules consistently work. If they worked,\neveryone would use them and then there would be no one on the other side of the trade. Therefore, the trade could not exist. Guidelines are very\nhelpful but reliable rules cannot exist, and this is usually very troubling to a trader starting out who wants to believe that trading is a game that can be\nvery profitable if only you can come up with just the right set of rules. All rules work some of the time, and usually just often enough to fool you into\nbelieving that you just need to tweak them a little to get them to work all of the time. You are trying to create a trading god who will protect you, but\nyou are fooling yourself and looking for an easy solution to a game where only hard solutions work. You are competing against the smartest people\nin the world, and if you are smart enough to come up with a foolproof rule set, so are they, and then everyone is faced with the zero-sum game\ndilemma. You cannot make money trading unless you are flexible, because you need to go where the market is going, and the market is extremely\nflexible. It can bend in every direction and for much longer than most would ever imagine. It can also reverse repeatedly every few bars for a long,\nlong time. Finally, it can and will do everything in between. Never get upset by this, and just accept it as reality and admire it as part of the beauty of\nthe game.\nThe market gravitates toward uncertainty. During most of the day, every market has a directional probability of 50–50 of an equidistant move up\nor down. By that I mean that if you don't even look at a chart and you buy any stock and then place a one cancels the other (OCO) order to exit on a\nprofit-taking limit order X cents above your entry or on a protective stop at X cents below your entry, you have about a 50 percent chance of being\nright. Likewise, if you sell any stock at any point in the day without looking at a chart and then place a profit-taking limit order X cents lower and a\nprotective stop X cents higher, you have about a 50 percent chance of winning and about a 50 percent chance of losing. There is the obvious\nexception of X being too large relative the price of the stock. You can't have X be $60 in a $50 stock, because you would have a 0 percent chance\nof losing $60. You also can't have X be $49, because the odds of losing $49 would also be minuscule. But if you pick a value for X that is within\nreasonable reach on your time frame, this is generally true. When the market is 50–50, it is uncertain and you cannot rationally have an opinion\nabout its direction. This is the hallmark of a trading range, so whenever you are uncertain, assume that the market is in a trading range. There are\nbrief times on a chart when the directional probability is higher. During a strong trend, it might be 60 or even 70 percent, but that cannot last long\nbecause it will gravitate toward uncertainty and a 50–50 market where both the bulls and bears feel there is value. When there is a trend and some\nlevel of directional certainty, the market will also gravitate toward areas of support and resistance, which are usually some type of measured move\naway, and those areas are invariably where uncertainty returns and a trading range develops, at least briefly.\nNever watch the news during the trading day. If you want to know what a news event means, the chart in front of you will tell you. Reporters believe\nthat the news is the most important thing in the world, and that everything that happens has to be caused by their biggest news story of the day.\nSince reporters are in the news business, news must be the center of the universe and the cause of everything that happens in the financial\nmarkets. When the stock market sold off in mid-March 2011, they attributed it to the earthquake in Japan. It did not matter to them that the market\nbegan to sell off three weeks earlier, after a buy climax. I told the members of my chat room in late February that the odds were good that the\nmarket was going to have a significant correction when I saw 15 consecutive bull trend bars on the daily chart after a protracted bull run. This was\nan unusually strong buy climax, and an important statement by the market. I had no idea that an earthquake was going to happen in a few weeks,\nand did not need to know that, anyway. The chart was telling me what traders were doing; they were getting ready to exit their longs and initiate\nshorts.\nTelevision experts are also useless. Invariably when the market makes a huge move, the reporter will find some confident, convincing expert who\npredicted it and interview him or her, leading the viewers to believe that this pundit has an uncanny ability to predict the market, despite the untold\nreality that this same pundit has been wrong in his last 10 predictions. The pundit then makes some future prediction and naïve viewers will attach\nsignificance to it and let it affect their trading. What the viewers may not realize is that some pundits are bullish 100 percent of the time and others\nare bearish 100 percent of the time, and still others just swing for the fences all the time and make outrageous predictions. The reporter just rushes\nto the one who is consistent with the day's news, which is totally useless to traders and in fact it is destructive because it can influence their trading\nand make them question and deviate from their own methods. No one is ever consistently right more than 60 percent of the time on these major\npredictions, and just because pundits are convincing does not make them reliable. There are equally smart and convincing people who believe the\nopposite but are not being heard. This is the same as watching a trial and listening to only the defense side of the argument. Hearing only one side\nis always convincing and always misleading, and rarely better than 50 percent reliable.\nInstitutional bulls and bears are placing trades all the time, and that is why there is constant uncertainty about the direction of the market. Even in\nthe absence of breaking news, the business channels air interviews all day long and each reporter gets to pick one pundit for her report. What you\nhave to realize is that she has a 50–50 chance of picking the right one in terms of the market's direction over the next hour or so. If you decide to\nrely on the pundit to make a trading decision and he says that the market will sell off after midday and instead it just keeps going up, are you going\nto look to short? Should you believe this very convincing head trader at one of Wall Street's top firms? He obviously is making over a million dollars\na year and they would not pay him that much unless he was able to correctly and consistently predict the market's direction. In fact, he probably can\nand he is probably a good stock picker, but he almost certainly is not a day trader.

Almost every bar offers important clues as to where the market is going, and a trader who dismisses any activity as noise is passing up many profitable trades each day. Most of the observations in these books are directly related to placing trades, but a few have to do with simple curious price action tendencies without sufficient dependability to be the basis for a trade.\nI personally rely mainly on candle charts for my Emini, futures, and stock trading, but most signals are also visible on any type of chart and many are even evident on simple line charts. I focus primarily on 5 minute candle charts to illustrate basic principles but also discuss daily and weekly charts as well.

If they worked, everyone would use them and then there would be no one on the other side of the trade. Therefore, the trade could not exist. Guidelines are very helpful but reliable rules cannot exist, and this is usually very troubling to a trader starting out who wants to believe that trading is a game that can be very profitable if only you can come up with just the right set of rules. All rules work some of the time, and usually just often enough to fool you into believing that you just need to tweak them a little to get them to work all of the time.

That means that they have to have\ninteresting guests, including some who will make outrageous predictions, others who are professorial and reassuring, and some who are just\nphysically attractive; most of them have to have some entertainment value. Although some guests are great traders, they cannot help you. For\nexample, if they interview one of the world's most successful bond traders, he will usually only speak in general terms about the trend over the next\nseveral months, and he will do so only weeks after he has already placed his trades. If you are a day trader, this does not help you, because every\nbull or bear market on the monthly chart has just about as many up moves on the intraday chart as down moves, and there will be long and short\ntrades every day. His time frame is very different from yours, and his trading has nothing to do with what you are doing. They will also often interview\na chartist from a major Wall Street firm, who, while his credentials are good, will be basing his opinion on a weekly chart, but the viewers are\nlooking to take profits within a few days.

When television\ninterviews a day trader instead, he will talk about the trades that he already took, and the information is too late to help you make money. By the\ntime he is on television, the market might already be going in the opposite direction. If he is talking while still in his day trade, he will continue to\nmanage his trade long after his two-minute interview is over, and he will not manage it while on the air. Even if you enter the trade that he is in, he\nwill not be there when you invariably will have to make an important decision about getting out as the market turns against you, or as the market\ngoes in your direction and you are thinking about taking profits.

They immediately perceive me as selfish, stubborn, and close-\nminded, and when it comes to trading, I am all of that and probably much more. The skills that make you money are generally seen as flaws to the\nlayperson. Why do I no longer read books or articles about trading, or talk to other traders about their ideas? As I said, the chart tells me all that I\nneed to know and any other information is a distraction. Several people have been offended by my attitude, but I think in part it comes from me\nturning down what they are presenting as something helpful to me when in reality they are making an offering, hoping that I will reciprocate with\nsome tutoring. They become frustrated and angry when I tell them that I don't want to hear about anyone else's trading techniques. I tell them that I\nhaven't even mastered my own and probably never will, but I am confident that I will make far more money perfecting what I already know than trying\nto incorporate non-price-action approaches into my trading. I ask them if James Galway offered a beautiful flute to Yo-Yo Ma and insisted that Ma\nstart learning to play the flute because Galway makes so much money by playing his flute, should Ma accept the offer? Clearly not. Ma should\ncontinue to play the cello and by doing so he will make far more money than if he also started playing the flute. I am no Galway or Ma, but the\nconcept is the same. Price action is the only instrument that I want to play, and I strongly believe that I will make far more money by mastering it than\nby incorporating ideas from other successful traders.\nThe charts, not the experts on television, will tell you exactly how the institutions are interpreting the news.\nYesterday, Costco's earnings were up 32 percent on the quarter and above analysts’ expectations (see Figure I.2). COST gapped up on the\nopen, tested the gap on the first bar, and then ran up over a dollar in 20 minutes. It then drifted down to test yesterday's close. It had two rallies that\nbroke bear trend lines, and both failed. This created a double top (bars 2 and 3) bear flag or triple top (bars 1, 2, and 3), and the market then\nplunged $3, below the prior day's low. If you were unaware of the report, you would have shorted at the failed bear trend line breaks at bars 2 and 3\nand you would have sold more below bar 4, which was a pullback that followed the breakout below yesterday's low.

Several people have been offended by my attitude, but I think in part it comes from me turning down what they are presenting as something helpful to me when in reality they are making an offering, hoping that I will reciprocate with some tutoring. They become frustrated and angry when I tell them that I don't want to hear about anyone else's trading techniques. I tell them that I haven't even mastered my own and probably never will, but I am confident that I will make far more money perfecting what I already know than trying to incorporate non-price-action approaches into my trading. I ask them if James Galway offered a beautiful flute to Yo-Yo Ma and insisted that Ma start learning to play the flute because Galway makes so much money by playing his flute, should Ma accept the offer? Clearly not. Ma should continue to play the cello and by doing so he will make far more money than if he also started playing the flute. I am no Galway or Ma, but the concept is the same. Price action is the only instrument that I want to play, and I strongly believe that I will make far more money by mastering it than by incorporating ideas from other successful traders.\nThe charts, not the experts on television, will tell you exactly how the institutions are interpreting the news.\nYesterday, Costco's earnings were up 32 percent on the quarter and above analysts’ expectations (see Figure I.2). COST gapped up on the open, tested the gap on the first bar, and then ran up over a dollar in 20 minutes. It then drifted down to test yesterday's close. It had two rallies that broke bear trend lines, and both failed. This created a double top (bars 2 and 3) bear flag or triple top (bars 1, 2, and 3), and the market then plunged $3, below the prior day's low. If you were unaware of the report, you would have shorted at the failed bear trend line breaks at bars 2 and 3 and you would have sold more below bar 4, which was a pullback that followed the breakout below yesterday's low. You would have reversed to long on the bar 5 big reversal bar, which was the second attempt to reverse the breakout below yesterday's low and a climactic reversal of the breakout of the bottom of the steep bear trend channel line.\nFigure I.2 Ignore the News", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["making 1 percent two or three times a day and maybe 1,000 percent a year.

This is a huge difference and makes me see gambling and trading as fundamentally different, despite\npublic perception. In trading, everyone is dealt the same cards so the game is always fair and, over time, you get rewarded or penalized entirely\ndue to your skill as a trader. Obviously, sometimes you can trade correctly and lose, and this can happen several times in a row due to the\nprobability curve of all possible outcomes. There is a real but microscopic chance that you can trade well and lose 10 or even 100 times or more in\na row; but I cannot remember the last time I saw as many as four good signals fail in a row, so this is a chance that I am willing to take.

In both sports betting and poker,\ngamblers are trying to take money from other gamblers rather than from the house, and therefore they can create odds in their favor if they are\nsignificantly better than their competitors. However, the “commissions” that they pay can be far greater than those that a trader pays, especially with\nsports betting, where the vig is usually 10 percent, and that is why incredibly successful sports gamblers like Billy Walters are so rare: they have to\nbe at least 10 percent better than the competition just to break even. Successful poker players are more common, as can be seen on all of the\npoker shows on TV. However, even the best poker players do not make anything comparable to what the best traders make, because the practical\nlimits to their trading size are much smaller.\nI personally find trading not to be stressful, because the luck factor is so tiny that it is not worth considering. However, there is one thing that\ntrading and playing poker share, and that is the value of patience. In poker, you stand to make far more money if you patiently wait to bet on only the\nvery best hands, and traders make more when they have the patience to wait for the very best setups. For me, this protracted downtime is much\neasier in trading because I can see all of the other “cards” during the slow times, and it is intellectually stimulating to look for subtle price action\nphenomena.\nThere is an important adage in gambling that is true in all endeavors, and that is that you should not bet until you have a good hand. In trading,\nthat is true as well. Wait for a good setup before placing a trade. If you trade without discipline and without a sound method, then you are relying on\nluck and hope for your profits, and your trading is unquestionably a form of gambling.\nOne unfortunate comparison is from nontraders who assume that all day traders, and all market traders for that matter, are addicted gamblers\nand therefore have a mental illness. I suspect that many are addicted, in the sense that they are doing it more for excitement than for profit. They are\nwilling to make low-probability bets and lose large sums of money because of the huge rush they feel when they occasionally win. However, most\nsuccessful traders are essentially investors, just like an investor who buys commercial real estate or a small business. The only real differences\nfrom any other type of investing are that the time frame is shorter and the leverage is greater.\nUnfortunately, it is common for beginners to occasionally gamble, and it invariably costs them money. Every successful trader trades on the basis\nof rules. Whenever traders deviate from those rules for any reason, they are trading on hope rather than logic and are then gambling. Beginning\ntraders often find themselves gambling right after having a couple of losses. They are eager to be made whole again and are willing to take some\nchances to make that happen. They will take trades that they normally would not take, because they are eager to get back the money they just lost.\nSince they are now taking a trade that they believe is a low-probability trade and they are taking it because of anxiety and sadness over their\nlosses, they are now gambling and not trading. After they lose on their gamble, they feel even worse. Not only are they even further down on the day,\nbut they feel especially sad because they are faced with the reality that they did not have the discipline to stick to their system when they know that\ndiscipline is one of the critical ingredients to success.\nInterestingly, neurofinance researchers have found that brain scan images of traders about to make a trade are indistinguishable from those of\ndrug addicts about to take a hit. They found a snowball effect and an increased desire to continue, regardless of the outcome of their behavior.\nUnfortunately, when faced with losses, traders assume more risk rather than less, often leading to the death of their accounts. Without knowing the\nneuroscience, Warren Buffett clearly understood the problem, as seen in his statement, “Once you have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the\ntemperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing.” The great traders control their emotions and constantly follow their\nrules.\nOne final point about gambling: There is a natural tendency to assume that nothing can last forever and that every behavior regresses toward a\nmean. If the market has three or four losing trades, surely the odds favor the next one being a winner. It's just like flipping a coin, isn't it?\nUnfortunately, that is not how markets behave. When a market is trending, most attempts to reverse fail. When it is in a trading range, most\nattempts to break out fail. This is the opposite of coin flips, where the odds are always 50–50. In trading, the odds are more like 70 percent or\nbetter that what just happened will continue to happen again and again. Because of the coin flip logic, most traders at some point begin to consider\ngame theory.\nMartingale techniques work well in theory but not in practice because of the conflict between math and emotion. That is the martingale paradox. If\nyou double (or even triple) your position size and reverse at each loss, you will theoretically make money. Although four losers in a row is\nuncommon on the 5 minute Emini chart if you choose your trades carefully, they will happen, and so will a dozen or more, even though I can't\nremember ever seeing that. In any case, if you are comfortable trading 10 contracts, but start with just one and plan to double up and reverse with\neach loss, four consecutive losers would require 16 contracts on your next trade and eight consecutive losers would require 256 contracts! It is\nunlikely that you would place a trade that is larger than your comfort zone following four or more losers. Anyone willing to trade one contract initially\nwould never be willing to trade 16 or 256 contracts, and anyone willing to trade 256 contracts would never be willing to initiate this strategy with just\none. This is the inherent, insurmountable, mathematical problem with this approach.\nSince trading is fun and competitive, it is natural for people to compare it to games, and because wagering is involved, gambling is usually the\nfirst thing that comes to mind. However, a far more apt analogy is to chess. In chess, you can see exactly what your opponent is doing, unlike in\ncard games where you don't know your opponent's cards. Also, in poker, the cards that you are dealt are yours purely by chance, but in chess, the\n", "text_clean": "buy a blue-chip stock, or even buy Treasury bonds (the government might choose to devalue the dollar to reduce the real size of our debt, and in so doing, the purchasing power of the dollars that you will get back from those bonds would be much less than when you originally bought the bonds).\nSome traders use simple game theory and increase the size of a trade after one or more losing trades (this is called a martingale approach to trading).

The only real differences from any other type of investing are that the time frame is shorter and the leverage is greater.\nUnfortunately, it is common for beginners to occasionally gamble, and it invariably costs them money. Every successful trader trades on the basis of rules. Whenever traders deviate from those rules for any reason, they are trading on hope rather than logic and are then gambling. Beginning traders often find themselves gambling right after having a couple of losses. They are eager to be made whole again and are willing to take some chances to make that happen. They will take trades that they normally would not take, because they are eager to get back the money they just lost.\nSince they are now taking a trade that they believe is a low-probability trade and they are taking it because of anxiety and sadness over their losses, they are now gambling and not trading. After they lose on their gamble, they feel even worse. Not only are they even further down on the day, but they feel especially sad because they are faced with the reality that they did not have the discipline to stick to their system when they know that discipline is one of the critical ingredients to success.\nInterestingly, neurofinance researchers have found that brain scan images of traders about to make a trade are indistinguishable from those of drug addicts about to take a hit. They found a snowball effect and an increased desire to continue, regardless of the outcome of their behavior.\nUnfortunately, when faced with losses, traders assume more risk rather than less, often leading to the death of their accounts. Without knowing the neuroscience, Warren Buffett clearly understood the problem, as seen in his statement, “Once you have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing.” The great traders control their emotions and constantly follow their rules.\nOne final point about gambling: There is a natural tendency to assume that nothing can last forever and that every behavior regresses toward a mean. If the market has three or four losing trades, surely the odds favor the next one being a winner. It's just like flipping a coin, isn't it?\nUnfortunately, that is not how markets behave. When a market is trending, most attempts to reverse fail. When it is in a trading range, most attempts to break out fail. This is the opposite of coin flips, where the odds are always 50–50. In trading, the odds are more like 70 percent or better that what just happened will continue to happen again and again. Because of the coin flip logic, most traders at some point begin to consider game theory.\nMartingale techniques work well in theory but not in practice because of the conflict between math and emotion. That is the martingale paradox. If you double (or even triple) your position size and reverse at each loss, you will theoretically make money. Although four losers in a row is uncommon on the 5 minute Emini chart if you choose your trades carefully, they will happen, and so will a dozen or more, even though I can't remember ever seeing that. In any case, if you are comfortable trading 10 contracts, but start with just one and plan to double up and reverse with each loss, four consecutive losers would require 16 contracts on your next trade and eight consecutive losers would require 256 contracts! It is unlikely that you would place a trade that is larger than your comfort zone following four or more losers. Anyone willing to trade one contract initially would never be willing to trade 16 or 256 contracts, and anyone willing to trade 256 contracts would never be willing to initiate this strategy with just one. This is the inherent, insurmountable, mathematical problem with this approach.\nSince trading is fun and competitive, it is natural for people to compare it to games, and because wagering is involved, gambling is usually the first thing that comes to mind. However, a far more apt analogy is to chess. In chess, you can see exactly what your opponent is doing, unlike in card games where you don't know your opponent's cards.

For example, in a bull spike, many bars have lows that are at or just one tick\nbelow the closes of the prior bar.

If it closes on or near its high tick, traders\ncontinued their strong buying in anticipation of new buyers entering right after the bar closes. They were willing to buy going into the\nclose because they were afraid that if they waited for the bar to close, they might have to buy a tick or two higher.\nOccasionally, there are gaps between the bodies (for example, the open of a bar might be above the close of the prior bar in a bull\ntrend).\nA breakout gap appears in the form of a strong trend bar at the start of the trend.\nMeasuring gaps occur where the breakout test does not overlap the breakout point. For example, the pullback from a bull breakout does\nnot drop below the high of the bar where the breakout occurred.\nMicro measuring gaps appear where there is a strong trend bar and a gap between the bar before it and the bar after it. For example, if\nthe low of the bar after a strong bull trend bar in a bull trend is at or above the high of the bar before the trend bar, this is a gap and a\nbreakout test and a sign of strength.\nNo big climaxes appear.\nNot many large bars appear (not even large trend bars). Often, the largest trend bars are countertrend, trapping traders into looking for\ncountertrend trades and missing with-trend trades. The countertrend setups almost always look better than the with-trend setups.\nNo significant trend channel line overshoots occur, and the minor ones result in only sideways corrections.\nThere are sideways corrections after trend line breaks.\nFailed wedges and other failed reversals occur.\nThere is a sequence of 20 moving average gap bars (20 or more consecutive bars that do not touch the moving average, discussed in\nbook 2).\nFew if any profitable countertrend trades are found.\nThere are small, infrequent, and mostly sideways pullbacks. For example, if the Emini's average range is 12 points, the pullbacks will all\nlikely be less than three or four points, and the market will often go for five or more bars without a pullback.\nThere is a sense of urgency. You find yourself waiting through countless bars for a good with-trend pullback and one never comes, yet\nthe market slowly continues to trend.\nThe pullbacks have strong setups. For example, the high 1 and high 2 pullbacks in a bull trend have strong bull reversal bars for signal\nbars.\nIn the strongest trends, the pullbacks usually have weak signal bars, making many traders not take them, and forcing traders to chase the\nmarket.

For example, when there is a bull channel and a large bear bar forms, this breakout\nbar has a low and close that are below the lows and closes of five or even 20 or more bars. A large number of bars reversed by the\nclose of the bear bar is a stronger sign than a similar number of bars reversed by only its low.\nBAR COUNTING BASICS: HIGH 1, HIGH 2, LOW 1, LOW 2\nA reliable sign that a pullback in a bull trend or in a trading range has ended is when the current bar's high extends at least one tick above the high\nof the prior bar. This leads to a useful concept of counting the number of times that this occurs, which is called bar counting. In a sideways or\ndownward move in a bull trend or a trading range, the first bar whose high is above the high of the prior bar is a high 1, and this ends the first leg of\nthe sideways or down move, although this leg may become a small leg in a larger pullback.

This is the most fundamental aspect of all trading\nand is at the heart of everything that we do. One of the most important skills that a trader can acquire is the ability to reliably determine when a\nbreakout will succeed or fail (creating a reversal). Remember, every trend bar is a breakout, and there are buyers and sellers at the top and bottom\nof every bull and bear trend bar, no matter how strong the bar appears. Since every trend bar is a breakout and trend bars are common, traders\nmust understand that they have to be assessing every few bars all day long whether a breakout will continue or fail and then reverse. This is the\nmost fundamental concept in trading, and it is crucial to a trader's financial success to understand it. A breakout of anything is the same. Even a\nclimactic reversal like a V bottom is simply a breakout and then a failed breakout. There are traders placing trades based on the belief that the\nbreakout will succeed, and other traders placing trades in the opposite direction, betting it will fail. The better traders become at assessing whether\na breakout will succeed or fail, the better positioned they are to make a living as a trader. Will the breakout succeed? If yes, then look to trade in\nthat direction. If no (and become a failed breakout, which is a reversal), then look to trade in the opposite direction. All trading comes down to this\ndecision.\nBreakout is a misleading term because out implies that it refers only to a market attempting to transition from a trading range into a trend, but it\ncan also be a buy or sell climax attempting to reverse into a trend in the opposite direction. The most important thing to understand about breakouts\nis that most breakouts fail. There is a strong propensity for the market to continue what it has been doing, and therefore there is a strong resistance\nto change. Just as most attempts to end a trend fail, most attempts to end a trading range and begin a trend also fail.\nA breakout is simply a move beyond some prior point of significance such as a trend line or a prior high or low, including the high or low of the\nprevious bar. That point becomes the breakout point, and if the market later comes back to test that point, the pullback is the breakout test (a\nbreakout pullback that reaches the area of the breakout point). The space between the breakout point and the breakout test is the breakout gap. A\nsignificant breakout, one that makes the always-in position clearly long or short and is likely to have follow-through for at least several bars, almost\nalways appears as a relatively large trend bar without significant tails. “Always in” is discussed in detail in the third book, and it means that if you\nhad to be in the market at all times, either long or short, the always-in position is whatever your current position is. The breakout is an attempt by the\nmarket either to reverse the trend or to move from a trading range into a new trend. Whenever the market is in a trading range, it should be\nconsidered to be in breakout mode. There is two-sided trading until one side gives up and the market becomes heavily one-sided, creating a spike\nthat becomes a breakout. All breakouts are spikes and can be made up of one or several consecutive trend bars. Breakouts of one type or another\nare very common and occur as often as every few bars on every chart. As is discussed in Chapter 6 on gaps, all breakouts are functionally\nequivalent to gaps, and since every trend bar is a breakout (and also a spike and a climax), it is also a gap. Many breakouts are easily overlooked,\nand any single one may be breaking out of many things at one time. Sometimes the market will have setups in both directions and is therefore in\nbreakout mode; this is sometimes referred to as being in an inflection area. Traders will be ready to enter in the direction of the breakout in either\ndirection. Because breakouts are one of the most common features of every chart, it is imperative to understand them, their follow-through, and\ntheir failure.\nThe high of the prior bar is usually a swing high on some lower time frame chart, so if the market moves above the high of the prior bar, it is\nbreaking above a lower time frame swing high. Also, when the market breaks above a prior swing high on the current chart, that high is simply the\nhigh of the prior bar on some higher time frame chart. The same is true for the low of the prior bar. It is usually a swing low on a lower time frame\nchart, and any swing low on the current chart is usually just the low of the prior bar on a higher time frame chart.\nIt is important to distinguish a breakout into a new trend from a breakout of a small trading range within a larger trading range. For example, if the\nchart on your screen is in a trading range, and the market breaks above a small trading range in the bottom half of the screen, most traders will\nassume that the market is still within the larger trading range, and not yet in a bull trend. The market might simply be forming a buy vacuum test of\nthe top of the larger trading range. Because of this, smart traders will not buy the closes of the strong bull trend bars near the top of the screen. In\nfact, many will sell out of their longs to take profits and others will short them, expecting the breakout attempt to fail. Similarly, even though buying a\nhigh 1 setup in strong bull spike can be a great trade, it is great only in a bull trend, not at the top of a trading range, where most breakout attempts\nwill fail. In general, if there is a strong bull breakout, but it is still below the high of the bars on the left half of the screen, make sure that the there is a\nstrong trend reversal underway before looking to buy near the top of the spike. If you believe that the market might still be within a trading range,\nonly consider buying pullbacks, instead of looking to buy near the top of the spike.\nBig traders don't hesitate to enter a trend during its spike phase, because they expect significant follow-through, even if there is a pullback\nimmediately after their entry. If a pullback occurs, they increase the size of their position. For example, if there is a strong bull breakout lasting\nseveral bars, more and more institutions become convinced that the market has become always-in long with each new higher tick, and as they\nbecome convinced that the market will go higher, they start buying, and they press the trades by buying more as the market continues to rise. This\nmakes the spike grow very quickly. They have many ways to enter, like buying at the market, buying a one- or two-tick pullback, buying above the\nprior bar on a stop, or buying on a breakout above a prior swing high. It does not matter how they get in, because their focus is to get at least a\nsmall position on, and then look to buy more as the market moves higher or if it pulls back. Because they will add on as the market goes higher, the\nspike can extend for many bars. A beginning trader sees the growing spike and wonders how anyone could be buying at the top of such a huge\nmove. What they don't understand is that the institutions are so confident that the market will soon be higher that they will buy all of the way up,\nbecause they don't want to miss the move while waiting for a pullback to form. Beginners are also afraid that their stops would have to be below the\nbottom of the spike, or at least below its midpoint, which is far away. The institutions know this, and simply adjust their position size down to a level\nwhere their dollars at risk are the same as for any other trade.\nAt some resistance level, the early buyers take some profits, and then the market pulls back a little. When it does, the traders who want a larger\nposition quickly buy, thereby keeping the initial pullback small. Also, the bulls who missed the earlier entries will use the pullback to finally get long.\nSome traders don't like to buy spikes, because they don't like to risk too much (the stop often needs to be below the bottom of the spike). They\nprefer to feel like they are buying at a better price (a discount) and therefore will wait for a pullback to form before buying. If everyone is looking to\nbuy a pullback, why would one ever develop? It is because not everyone is looking to buy. Experienced traders who bought early on know that the\nmarket can reverse at any time, and once they feel that the market has reached a resistance area where they think that profit taking might come in\nor the market might reverse, they will take partial profits (they will begin to scale out of their longs), and sometimes will sell out of their entire\n", "text_clean": "Part I\nBreakouts: Transitioning into a New Trend The market is always trying to break out, and then the market tries to make every breakout fail.

These are not the bulls who are looking to buy a few ticks lower on the first pullback. The experienced traders who are taking partial profits\nare scaling out because they are afraid of a reversal, or of a deeper pullback where they could buy back many ticks lower. If they believed that the\npullback was only going to last for a few ticks, and then the bull was going to resume, they would never have exited. They always take their profits at\nsome resistance level, like a measured move target, a trend line, a trend channel line, a new high, or at the bottom of a trading range above. Most\nof the trading is done by computers, so everything has a mathematical basis, which means that the profit taking targets are based on the prices on\nthe screen. With practice, traders can learn to spot areas where the computers might take profits, and they can take their profits at the same prices,\nexpecting a pullback to follow. Although trends have inertia and will go above most resistance areas, when a reversal finally does come, it will\nalways be at a resistance area, whether or not it is obvious to you.\nSometimes the spike will have a bar or a pattern that will allow aggressive bears to take a small scalp, if they think that the pullback is imminent\nand that there is enough room for a profit. However, most traders who attempt this will lose, because most of the pullbacks do not go far enough for\na profit, or the trader's equation is weak (the probability of making a scalp times the size of the profit is smaller than the probability of losing times\nthe size of the protective stop). Also, traders who take the short are hoping so much for their small profit that they invariably end up missing the\nmuch more profitable long that forms a few minutes later.\nTraders enter in the direction of the breakout or in the opposite direction, depending on whether they expect it to succeed or to fail. Are they\nbelievers or nonbelievers? There are many ways to enter in the direction of the breakout. Once traders feel a sense of urgency because they\nbelieve that a significant move might be underway, they need to get into the market. Entering during a breakout is difficult for many traders because\nthe risk is larger and the move is fast. They will often freeze and not take the trade. They are worried about the size of the potential loss, which\nmeans that they are caring too much to trade. They have to get their position size down to the “I don't care” size so that they can quickly get in the\ntrade. The best way for them to take a scary trade is to automatically trade only a third or a quarter of their normal trade size and use the wide stop\nthat is required. They might catch a big move, and making a lot on a small position is much better than making nothing on their usual position size. It\nis important to avoid making the mistake of not caring to the point that you begin to trade weak setups and then lose money. First spot a good\nsetup and then enter the “I don't care” mode.\nAs soon as traders feel that the market has had a clear always-in move, they believe that a trend is underway and they need to get in as soon as\npossible. For example, if there is a strong bull breakout, they can buy the close of the bar that made them believe that the trend has begun. They\nmight need to see the next bar also have a bull close. If they wait and they get that bull close, they could buy as soon as the bar closes, either with a\nlimit order at the level of the close of the bar or with a market order. They could wait for the first pause or pullback bar and place a limit order to buy\nat its close, a tick above its low, at its low, or a tick or two below its low. They can place a limit order to buy any small pullback, like a one- to four-\ntick pullback in the Emini, or a 5 to 10 cent pullback in a stock. If the breakout bar is not too large, the low of the next bar might test the high of the\nbar before the breakout, creating a breakout test. They might place a limit order to buy at or just above the high of that bar, and risk to the low of the\nbreakout bar. If they try to buy at or below a pause bar and they do not get filled, they can place a buy stop order at one tick above the high of the\nbar. If the spike is strong, they can look to buy the first high 1 setup, which is a breakout pullback. Earlier on, they can look at a 1, 2, or 3 minute\nchart and buy at or below the low of a prior bar, above a high 1 or high 2 signal bar, or with a limit order at the moving average. Once they are in,\nthey should manage the position like any trend trade, and look for a swing to a measured move target to take profits and not exit with a small scalp.\nThe bulls will expect every attempt by the bears to fail, and therefore look to buy each one. They will buy around the close of every bear trend bar,\neven if the bar is large and closes on its low. They will buy as the market falls below the low of the prior bar, any prior swing low, and any support\nlevel, like a trend line. They also will buy every attempt by the market to go higher, like around the high of a bull trend bar or as the market moves\nabove the high of the prior bar or above a resistance level. This is the exact opposite of what traders do in strong bear markets, when they sell\nabove and below bars, and above and below both resistance and support. They sell above bars (and around every type of resistance), including\nstrong bull trend bars, because they see each move up as an attempt to reverse the trend, and most trend reversal attempts fail. They will sell below\nbars (and around every type of support), because they see each move down as an attempt to resume the bear trend, and expect that most will\nsucceed.\nSince most breakout attempts fail, many traders enter breakouts in the opposite direction. For example, if there is a bull trend and it forms a\nlarge bear trend bar closing on its low, most traders will expect this reversal attempt to fail, and many will buy at the close of the bar. If the next bar\nhas a bull body, they will buy at the close of the bar and above its high. The first target is the high of the bear trend bar, and the next target is a\nmeasured move up, equal to the height of the bear trend bar. Some traders will use an initial protective stop that is about the same number of ticks\nas the bear trend bar is tall, and others will use their usual stop, like two points in the Emini. Information comes fast during a breakout, and traders\ncan usually formulate increasingly strong opinions with the close of each subsequent bar. If there is a second strong bear trend bar and then a third,\nmore traders will believe that the always-in position has reversed to down, and the bears will short more. The bulls who bought the bear spike will\nsoon decide that the market will work lower over the next several bars and will therefore exit their longs. It does not make sense for them to hold\nlong when they believe that the market will be lower in the near future. It makes more sense for them to sell out of their longs, take the loss, and then\nbuy again at a lower price once they think that the bull trend will resume. Because the bulls have become sellers, at least for the next several bars,\nthere is no one left to buy, and the market falls to the next level of support. If the market rallied after that first bear bar, the bears would quickly see\nthat they were wrong and would buy back their shorts. With no one left to short and everyone buying (the bulls initiating new longs and the bears\nbuying back their shorts), the market will probably rally, at least for several more bars.\nTraders have to assess a breakout in relation to the entire chart and not just the current leg. For example, if the market is breaking out in a strong\nbull spike, look across the chart to the left side of the screen. If there are no bars at the level of the current price, then buying closes and risking to\nbelow the bottom of the spike is often a good strategy. Since the risk is big, trade small, but because a strong breakout has at least a 60 percent\nchance of reaching a measured move that is approximately equal to the size of the spike, the trader's equation is good (the probability of success\ntimes the potential reward is greater than the probability of failure times the risk). However, when you look to the left side of the screen, if you see\nthat the current breakout is still below the high from 20 or 30 bars earlier, the market might still be in a trading range. Trading ranges regularly have\nsharp bull spikes that race to the top, only to reverse. The market then races to the bottom and that breakout attempt also fails. Because of this,\nbuying the closes of strong bull trend bars near the top of the trading range is risky, and it is usually better to look to buy pullbacks instead. Traders\nshould trade the market like a trading range until it is clearly in a trend.\nA move above a prior high in a bull trend will generally lead to one of three outcomes: more buying, profit taking, or shorting. When the trend is\nstrong, strong bulls will press (add to) their longs by buying the breakout above the old high and there will be a measured move up of some kind. If\nthe market goes up far enough above the breakout to enable a trader to make at least a profitable scalp before there is a pullback, then assume\nthat there was mostly new buying at the high. If it goes sideways and the breakout shows signs of weakness (discussed further on), assume that\nthere was profit taking and that the bulls are looking to buy again a little lower. If the market reverses down hard, assume that the strong bears\n", "text_clean": "position. These are not the bulls who are looking to buy a few ticks lower on the first pullback. The experienced traders who are taking partial profits are scaling out because they are afraid of a reversal, or of a deeper pullback where they could buy back many ticks lower. If they believed that the pullback was only going to last for a few ticks, and then the bull was going to resume, they would never have exited. They always take their profits at some resistance level, like a measured move target, a trend line, a trend channel line, a new high, or at the bottom of a trading range above. Most of the trading is done by computers, so everything has a mathematical basis, which means that the profit taking targets are based on the prices on the screen. With practice, traders can learn to spot areas where the computers might take profits, and they can take their profits at the same prices, expecting a pullback to follow. Although trends have inertia and will go above most resistance areas, when a reversal finally does come, it will always be at a resistance area, whether or not it is obvious to you.\nSometimes the spike will have a bar or a pattern that will allow aggressive bears to take a small scalp, if they think that the pullback is imminent and that there is enough room for a profit. However, most traders who attempt this will lose, because most of the pullbacks do not go far enough for a profit, or the trader's equation is weak (the probability of making a scalp times the size of the profit is smaller than the probability of losing times the size of the protective stop). Also, traders who take the short are hoping so much for their small profit that they invariably end up missing the much more profitable long that forms a few minutes later.\nTraders enter in the direction of the breakout or in the opposite direction, depending on whether they expect it to succeed or to fail. Are they believers or nonbelievers? There are many ways to enter in the direction of the breakout. Once traders feel a sense of urgency because they believe that a significant move might be underway, they need to get into the market. Entering during a breakout is difficult for many traders because the risk is larger and the move is fast. They will often freeze and not take the trade. They are worried about the size of the potential loss, which means that they are caring too much to trade. They have to get their position size down to the “I don't care” size so that they can quickly get in the trade. The best way for them to take a scary trade is to automatically trade only a third or a quarter of their normal trade size and use the wide stop that is required. They might catch a big move, and making a lot on a small position is much better than making nothing on their usual position size. It is important to avoid making the mistake of not caring to the point that you begin to trade weak setups and then lose money. First spot a good setup and then enter the “I don't care” mode.\nAs soon as traders feel that the market has had a clear always-in move, they believe that a trend is underway and they need to get in as soon as possible. For example, if there is a strong bull breakout, they can buy the close of the bar that made them believe that the trend has begun. They might need to see the next bar also have a bull close. If they wait and they get that bull close, they could buy as soon as the bar closes, either with a limit order at the level of the close of the bar or with a market order. They could wait for the first pause or pullback bar and place a limit order to buy at its close, a tick above its low, at its low, or a tick or two below its low. They can place a limit order to buy any small pullback, like a one- to fourtick pullback in the Emini, or a 5 to 10 cent pullback in a stock. If the breakout bar is not too large, the low of the next bar might test the high of the bar before the breakout, creating a breakout test. They might place a limit order to buy at or just above the high of that bar, and risk to the low of the breakout bar. If they try to buy at or below a pause bar and they do not get filled, they can place a buy stop order at one tick above the high of the bar. If the spike is strong, they can look to buy the first high 1 setup, which is a breakout pullback. Earlier on, they can look at a 1, 2, or 3 minute chart and buy at or below the low of a prior bar, above a high 1 or high 2 signal bar, or with a limit order at the moving average. Once they are in, they should manage the position like any trend trade, and look for a swing to a measured move target to take profits and not exit with a small scalp.\nThe bulls will expect every attempt by the bears to fail, and therefore look to buy each one. They will buy around the close of every bear trend bar, even if the bar is large and closes on its low. They will buy as the market falls below the low of the prior bar, any prior swing low, and any support level, like a trend line. They also will buy every attempt by the market to go higher, like around the high of a bull trend bar or as the market moves above the high of the prior bar or above a resistance level. This is the exact opposite of what traders do in strong bear markets, when they sell above and below bars, and above and below both resistance and support. They sell above bars (and around every type of resistance), including strong bull trend bars, because they see each move up as an attempt to reverse the trend, and most trend reversal attempts fail. They will sell below bars (and around every type of support), because they see each move down as an attempt to resume the bear trend, and expect that most will succeed.\nSince most breakout attempts fail, many traders enter breakouts in the opposite direction. For example, if there is a bull trend and it forms a large bear trend bar closing on its low, most traders will expect this reversal attempt to fail, and many will buy at the close of the bar. If the next bar has a bull body, they will buy at the close of the bar and above its high.

There is a gradual\ntransition. A trader becomes less bullish, then neutral, and then bearish. Once enough traders make this transition, the market reverses into a\ndeeper correction or into a bear trend. Every trading firm has its own measure of excess, and at some point enough firms decide that the trend has\ngone too far. They believe that there is little risk of missing a great move up if they stop buying above the old high, and they will buy only on\npullbacks. If the market hesitates above the old high, the market is becoming two-sided, and the strong bulls are using the new high to take profits.\nProfit taking means that traders are still bullish and are looking to buy a pullback. Most new highs are followed by profit taking. Every new high is\na potential top, but most reversal attempts fail and become the beginning of bull flags, only to be followed by another new high. If a rally to test the\nhigh has several small pullbacks within the leg up, with lots of overlapping bars, several bear bodies, and big tails on the tops of the bars, and most\nof the bull trend bars are weak, then the market is becoming increasingly two-sided. The bulls are taking profits at the tops of the bars and buying\nonly at the bottoms of the bars, and the bears are beginning to short at the tops of the bars. Similarly, the bulls are taking profits as the market\napproaches the top of the bull trend and the bears are shorting more. If the market goes above the bull high, it is likely that the profit taking and\nshorting will be even stronger.\nMost traders do not like to reverse, so if they are anticipating a reversal signal, they prefer to exit their longs and then wait for that signal. The loss\nof these bulls on the final leg up in the trend contributes to the weakness of the rally to the final high. If there is a strong reversal down after the\nmarket breaks above the prior high, the strong bears are taking control of the market, at least for the near term. Once that happens, then the bulls\nwho were hoping to buy a small pullback believe instead that the market will fall further. They therefore wait to buy until there is a much larger\npullback, and their absence of buying allows the bears to drive the market down into a deeper correction lasting 10 or more bars and often having\ntwo or more legs. Whenever there is a new trend, traders reverse their mind-set. When a bull trend reverses to a bear trend, they stop buying above\nbars on stops and buying below bars on limit orders, and begin selling above bars on limit orders and selling below bars on stops. When a bear\ntrend reverses to a bull trend, they stop selling below bars on stops and selling above bars on limit orders, and begin buying above bars on stops\nand buying below bars on limit orders.\nThere is one situation where the breakout in a bull trend is routinely met by aggressive shorts who will usually take over the market. A pullback is\na minor trend in the opposite direction, and traders expect it to end soon and for the larger trend to resume. When there is a pullback in a strong\nbear trend, the market will often have two legs up in the minor bull trend. As the market goes above the high of the first leg up, it is breaking out\nabove a prior swing high in a minor bull trend. However, since most traders will see the move up as a pullback that will end very soon, the dominant\ntraders on the breakout will usually be aggressive sellers, instead of aggressive new buyers, and the minor bull trend will usually reverse back down\ninto the direction of the major bear trend after breaking out above the first or second swing high in the pullback.\nThe same is true of new lows in a bear trend. When the bear trend is strong, strong bears will press their shorts by adding to their positions on\nthe breakout to a new low and the market will continue to fall until it reaches some measured move target. As the trend weakens, the price action at\na new low will be less clear, which means that the strong bears are using the new low as an area to take profits on their shorts rather than as an\narea to add to their shorts. As the bear trend further loses strength, the strong bulls will eventually see a new low as a great price to initiate longs\nand they will be able to create a reversal pattern and then a significant rally.\nAs a trend matures, it usually transitions into a trading range, but the first trading ranges that form are usually followed by a continuation of the\ntrend. How do the strong bulls and bears act as a trend matures? In a bull trend, when the trend is strong, the pullbacks are small because the\nstrong bulls want to buy more on a pullback. Since they suspect that there may not be a pullback until the market is much higher, they begin to buy in\npieces, but relentlessly. They look for any reason to buy, and with so many big traders in the market, there will be some buying for every imaginable\nreason. They place limit orders to buy a few ticks down and other limit orders to buy a few ticks above the low of the prior bar, at the low of the prior\nbar, and below the low of the prior bar. They place stop orders to buy above the high of the prior bar and on a breakout above any prior swing high.\nThey also buy on the close of both any bull or bear trend bar. They see the bear trend bar as a brief opportunity to buy at a better price and the bull\ntrend bar as a sign that the market is about to move up quickly.\nThe strong bears are smart and see what is going on. Since they believe, just like the strong bulls, that the market is going to be higher before\nlong, it does not make sense for them to be shorting. They just step aside and wait until they can sell higher. How much higher? Each institution has\nits own measure of excess, but once the market gets to a price level where enough bear firms believe that it might not go any higher, they will begin\nto short. If enough of them short around the same price level, more and larger bear trend bars form and bars start to get tails on the tops. These are\nsigns of selling pressure, and they tell all traders that the bulls are becoming weaker and the bears are becoming stronger. The strong bulls\neventually stop buying above the last swing high and instead begin to take profits as the market goes to a new high. They are still bullish but are\nbecoming selective and will buy only on pullbacks. As the two-sided trading increases and the sell-offs have more bear trend bars and last for more\nbars, the strong bulls will want to buy only at the bottom of the developing trading range and will look to take profits at the top. The strong bears\nbegin to short at new highs and are now willing to scale in higher. They might take partial profits near the bottom of the developing trading range if\nthey think that the market might reverse back up and break out to a new high, but they will keep looking to short new highs. At some point, the\nmarket becomes a 50–50 market and neither the bulls nor the bears are in control; eventually the bears become dominant, a bear trend begins,\nand the opposite process unfolds.\nA protracted trend will often have an unusually strong breakout, but it can be an exhaustive climax. For example, in a protracted bull trend, all\nstrong bulls and bears love to see a large bull trend bar or two, especially if it is exceptionally large, because they expect it to be a brief, unusually\ngreat opportunity. Once the market is close to where the strong bulls and bears want to sell, like near a measured move target or a trend channel\nline, especially if the move is the second or third consecutive buy climax, they step aside. The absence of selling by the strongest traders results in\na vacuum above the market. The programs that detect the momentum early on in a bar see this and quickly buy repeatedly until the momentum\nslows. Since few strong traders are selling, the result is one or two relatively large bull trend bars. This bull spike is just the sign that the strong\ntraders have been waiting for, and once it is there, they appear as if out of nowhere and begin their selling. The bulls take profits on their longs and\nthe bears initiate new shorts. Both sell aggressively at the close of the bar, above its high, at the close of the next bar (especially if it is a weaker\nbar), and at the close of the following bar, especially if the bars are starting to have bear bodies. They also short below the low of the prior bar.\nWhen they see a strong bear trend bar, they short at its close and below its low. The momentum programs also take profits. Both the bulls and the\nbears expect a larger correction, and the bulls will not consider buying again until at least a 10-bar, two-legged correction, and even then only if the\nsell-off looks weak. The bears expect the same sell-off and will not be eager to take profits too early.\nWeak traders see that large bull trend bar in the opposite way. The weak bulls, who had been sitting on the sidelines hoping for an easy pullback\nto buy, see the market running away from them and want to make sure they catch this next leg up, especially since the bar is so strong and the day\nis almost over. The weak bears, who shorted early and maybe scaled in, were terrified by the rapidity with which the bar broke to a new high.

If the market goes above the bull high, it is likely that the profit taking and shorting will be even stronger.\nMost traders do not like to reverse, so if they are anticipating a reversal signal, they prefer to exit their longs and then wait for that signal. The loss of these bulls on the final leg up in the trend contributes to the weakness of the rally to the final high.

A pullback is a minor trend in the opposite direction, and traders expect it to end soon and for the larger trend to resume. When there is a pullback in a strong bear trend, the market will often have two legs up in the minor bull trend. As the market goes above the high of the first leg up, it is breaking out above a prior swing high in a minor bull trend. However, since most traders will see the move up as a pullback that will end very soon, the dominant traders on the breakout will usually be aggressive sellers, instead of aggressive new buyers, and the minor bull trend will usually reverse back down into the direction of the major bear trend after breaking out above the first or second swing high in the pullback.\nThe same is true of new lows in a bear trend. When the bear trend is strong, strong bears will press their shorts by adding to their positions on the breakout to a new low and the market will continue to fall until it reaches some measured move target. As the trend weakens, the price action at a new low will be less clear, which means that the strong bears are using the new low as an area to take profits on their shorts rather than as an area to add to their shorts. As the bear trend further loses strength, the strong bulls will eventually see a new low as a great price to initiate longs and they will be able to create a reversal pattern and then a significant rally.\nAs a trend matures, it usually transitions into a trading range, but the first trading ranges that form are usually followed by a continuation of the trend. How do the strong bulls and bears act as a trend matures? In a bull trend, when the trend is strong, the pullbacks are small because the strong bulls want to buy more on a pullback. Since they suspect that there may not be a pullback until the market is much higher, they begin to buy in pieces, but relentlessly. They look for any reason to buy, and with so many big traders in the market, there will be some buying for every imaginable reason. They place limit orders to buy a few ticks down and other limit orders to buy a few ticks above the low of the prior bar, at the low of the prior bar, and below the low of the prior bar. They place stop orders to buy above the high of the prior bar and on a breakout above any prior swing high.\nThey also buy on the close of both any bull or bear trend bar. They see the bear trend bar as a brief opportunity to buy at a better price and the bull trend bar as a sign that the market is about to move up quickly.\nThe strong bears are smart and see what is going on. Since they believe, just like the strong bulls, that the market is going to be higher before long, it does not make sense for them to be shorting. They just step aside and wait until they can sell higher. How much higher? Each institution has its own measure of excess, but once the market gets to a price level where enough bear firms believe that it might not go any higher, they will begin to short. If enough of them short around the same price level, more and larger bear trend bars form and bars start to get tails on the tops. These are signs of selling pressure, and they tell all traders that the bulls are becoming weaker and the bears are becoming stronger. The strong bulls eventually stop buying above the last swing high and instead begin to take profits as the market goes to a new high. They are still bullish but are becoming selective and will buy only on pullbacks. As the two-sided trading increases and the sell-offs have more bear trend bars and last for more bars, the strong bulls will want to buy only at the bottom of the developing trading range and will look to take profits at the top. The strong bears begin to short at new highs and are now willing to scale in higher. They might take partial profits near the bottom of the developing trading range if they think that the market might reverse back up and break out to a new high, but they will keep looking to short new highs. At some point, the market becomes a 50–50 market and neither the bulls nor the bears are in control; eventually the bears become dominant, a bear trend begins, and the opposite process unfolds.\nA protracted trend will often have an unusually strong breakout, but it can be an exhaustive climax. For example, in a protracted bull trend, all strong bulls and bears love to see a large bull trend bar or two, especially if it is exceptionally large, because they expect it to be a brief, unusually great opportunity. Once the market is close to where the strong bulls and bears want to sell, like near a measured move target or a trend channel line, especially if the move is the second or third consecutive buy climax, they step aside. The absence of selling by the strongest traders results in a vacuum above the market. The programs that detect the momentum early on in a bar see this and quickly buy repeatedly until the momentum slows. Since few strong traders are selling, the result is one or two relatively large bull trend bars. This bull spike is just the sign that the strong traders have been waiting for, and once it is there, they appear as if out of nowhere and begin their selling. The bulls take profits on their longs and the bears initiate new shorts. Both sell aggressively at the close of the bar, above its high, at the close of the next bar (especially if it is a weaker bar), and at the close of the following bar, especially if the bars are starting to have bear bodies. They also short below the low of the prior bar.\nWhen they see a strong bear trend bar, they short at its close and below its low. The momentum programs also take profits. Both the bulls and the bears expect a larger correction, and the bulls will not consider buying again until at least a 10-bar, two-legged correction, and even then only if the sell-off looks weak. The bears expect the same sell-off and will not be eager to take profits too early.\nWeak traders see that large bull trend bar in the opposite way. The weak bulls, who had been sitting on the sidelines hoping for an easy pullback to buy, see the market running away from them and want to make sure they catch this next leg up, especially since the bar is so strong and the day is almost over. The weak bears, who shorted early and maybe scaled in, were terrified by the rapidity with which the bar broke to a new high.

If it is to the downside and strong, the market is in a strong bear trend.\nOnce the bears are strong enough to push a pullback well below the bull trend line and the moving average, they are confident enough that the\nmarket will likely not go much higher and they will aggressively short above the old high. At this point, the bulls will have decided that they should buy\nonly a deep pullback. A new mind-set is now dominant at the new high. It is no longer a place to buy, because it no longer represents much strength.\nYes, there is profit taking by the bulls, but most big traders now look at the new high as a great opportunity to initiate shorts. The market has\nreached the tipping point, and most traders have stopped looking to buy small pullbacks and instead are looking to sell rallies. The bears are\ndominant and the strong selling will likely lead to a large correction or even a trend reversal. After the next strong push down, the bears will look for a\nlower high to sell again or to add to their short positions, and the bulls who bought the pullback will become concerned that the trend might have\nreversed or at least that there will be a much larger pullback. Instead of hoping for a new bull high to take profits on their longs, they will now take\nprofits at a lower high and not look to buy again until after a larger correction. Bulls know that most reversal attempts fail, and many who rode the\ntrend up will not exit their longs until after the bears have demonstrated the ability to push the market down hard. Once these bulls see this\nimpressive selling pressure, they will then look for a rally to finally exit their longs. Their supply will limit the rally, and their selling, added to the\nshorting by aggressive bears and the profit taking by bulls who saw the sell-off as a buying opportunity, will create a second leg down.\nIf the market enters a bear trend, the process will reverse. When the bear trend is strong, traders will short below prior lows. As the trend\nweakens, the bears will take profits at new lows and the market will likely enter a trading range. After a strong rally above the bull trend line and the\nmoving average, the bears will take profits at a new low and strong bulls will aggressively buy and try to take control of the market. The result will be\na larger bear rally or possibly a reversal into a bull trend.\nA similar situation occurs when there is a pullback that is large enough to make traders wonder if the trend has reversed. For example, if there is\na deep, sharp pullback in a bull trend, traders will begin to wonder if the market has reversed. They are looking at moves below prior swing lows,\nbut this is in the context of a pullback in a bull trend instead of as part of a bear trend. They will watch what happens as the market falls (breaks out)\nbelow a prior swing low. Will the market fall far enough for bears, who entered on a sell stop below that swing low, to make a profit? Did the new low\nfind more sellers than buyers? If it did, that is a sign that the bears are strong and that the pullback will probably go further. The trend might even\nhave reversed.\nAnother possibility on the breakout to a new low is that the market enters a trading range, which is evidence that the shorts took profits and that\nthere was unimpressive buying by the bulls. The final alternative is that the market reverses up after the breakout to a new low. This means that\nthere were strong bulls below that swing low just waiting for the market to test there. This is a sign that the sell-off is more likely just a big pullback in\nan ongoing bull trend. The shorts from higher up took profits on the breakout to the new low because they believed that the trend was still up. The\nstrong bulls bought aggressively because they believed that the market would not fall further and that it would rally to test the bull high.\nWhenever there is any breakout below a swing low, traders will watch carefully for evidence that the bulls have returned or that the bears have\ntaken control. They need to decide what influence is greater at the new low, and will use the market's behavior to make that decision. If there is a\nstrong breakout, then new selling is dominant. If the market's movement is uncertain, then profit taking by the shorts and weak buying by the bulls\nare taking place, and the market will likely enter a trading range. If there is a strong reversal up, then aggressive buying by the longs is the most\nimportant factor.\nSometimes, when the market is in a weak trend, there is a large breakout bar in the direction of the trend. That breakout bar often acts as a\nspike, and it is usually followed by several more trend bars, but they usually overlap and have tails. These bars create a tight bull channel. Like with\nany spike and channel trend, the market often tests back to the start of the channel, which in this case is the breakout gap area. For example, if\nthere is a relatively weak bull swing and then the market breaks to the upside with a large bull trend bar, and this is followed by three or four more\nsmaller bull trend bars, these bars usually act as a channel. Once the market trades down to the area of the first of those channel bars, it often goes\nslightly below its low, and that puts the market in the gap area that was created by the breakout bar. The gap is both a measuring gap and a\nbreakout gap, and the test of the gap is usually followed by a resumption of the trend rather than the start of a reversal down.\nAn inflection is a mathematical term that means that there has been a change of direction. For example, if there is a horizontal wave that goes up\nand down repeatedly, when the wave is going down, at some point the slope changes from steeply down to less steeply down as it begins to form a\nbottom. For example, the middle of the letter S is the inflection point in the curve, because it is the point where the slope begins to change direction.\nIn trading, an inflection is just an area where you expect a trend reversal, which may or may not develop. Since the move can go in either direction,\nthe market is in breakout mode and traders will be ready to enter in the direction of the breakout. In either case, the market will often make a\nmeasured move, which is a move that covers about the same number of points as the pattern that led up to it. For example, a double top often\nleads to a breakout to the upside or downside. After the breakout, the market often runs beyond the breakout point to a measured move target that\nis about the same number of points away as the distance from the bottom to the top of the double top. There is often a gap between the breakout\npoint and the first pullback, and the middle of the gap often leads to a measured move (measuring gaps are discussed in Chapter 6 on gaps).\nBreakout mode situations can behave in an opposite way in a trading range. For example, if there is a breakout mode setup in the middle of a\ntrading range, there may be more buyers than sellers below the bar and more sellers than buyers above. If the situation is too uncertain to make\ntraders believe that they have a good trader's equation, it is usually better to wait for clarity. At the extremes of a trading range, three things can\nhappen: there can be (1) a reversal, (2) a breakout that fails and is followed by a reversal, or (3) a successful breakout. Only one of the three leads\nto a trend. This is consistent with the concept that most breakout attempts fail.\nWhen there is a breakout against a trend, the countertrend traders are trying to create a channel (a spike and channel trend) or some other form\nof a new trend after their spike. However, the trend traders are usually able to reverse the breakout within a few bars, turning it into a flag. For\nexample, if there is a bear channel that has a large bull trend bar or two breaking above the channel, the bulls are hoping to form a bull channel after\na pullback. However, they will usually fail and the bull spike will end up as simply part of a bear flag.

If the trend that preceded\nthe breakout is starting out and is very strong, there will be some profit taking, like after bars 5, 12, and 17, but the new buyers will overwhelm the\nbears, and the trend will quickly resume. Later in the trend, there will be much less new buying and much more profit taking, like after bar 19. There\nare many measures of excess, and once enough trading firms believe that the bull trend is overdone, they will take profits on their longs and buy\nagain only after about a 10-bar, two-legged correction. I use the phrase “10-bar, two-legged” often, and my intention is to say that the correction will\nlast longer and be more complex than a small pullback. That usually requires at least 10 bars and two legs, and sometimes can result in a trend\nreversal.\nWhenever there is a breakout, it might fail and lead to a trend reversal. The chance of a successful reversal is greater if the context is right and\nthe reversal bar is strong. If the breakout bar and spike leading to the breakout is stronger than the reversal bar, and the chance of a climactic\nreversal is not great, the odds are that the reversal attempt will fail within a few bars and form a breakout pullback setup that will lead to a\nresumption of the trend. For example, bar 12 was a small bear reversal bar, but it followed a much stronger three-bar bull spike and the market was\ntrending up in a tight channel all day following a large gap up. This made the odds of a successful reversal small, so bulls bought at and below the\nlow of bar 12. The next bar was a doji and therefore a weak entry bar for the bears, so there were almost certainly going to be more buyers than\nsellers above its high. It became a breakout pullback buy signal bar (here, a high 1 buy setup). The next bar was a bull bar, and more buyers bought\nabove its high. In general, the odds of a successful buy signal are greater when traders wait to enter above a bull bar. Bar 14 was the breakout bar,\nbut it closed on its low and formed a bear doji reversal bar, which is a weak sell signal in the face of such a tight bull channel. The bulls were so\naggressive that they did not want the short to trigger. They placed limit orders at and above the low of the bear bar, and there were enough buy\norders to overwhelm the bears.

Bar 14 was simply another pullback from the breakout\n(and it was also the breakout), and traders bought above the high of bar 15, which was another breakout pullback buy signal.\nAnother example of comparing the strength of the breakout with that of the reversal occurred on the bar 5 breakout. The bear bar after bar 5 was\nthe signal bar for the failed breakout of the bar 4 one bar bull flag and the breakout above bar 3. The bear signal was small compared to the 3 bar\nbull spike up from bar 4, and was therefore unlikely to reverse the trend. The next bar was a breakout pullback buy setup, but had a bear body,\nwhich is not a strong buy signal bar. The bar after had a bull body and therefore buying above its high had a higher probability of success.\nBar 10 was a breakout of an ii bull flag, but the breakout bar was a bear reversal bar, which is a weak breakout bar. This increased the chances\nthat the breakout would fail. The breakout bar was also the signal bar for the failed breakout.\nThe correction sometimes breaks the bull trend line and creates enough selling pressure for the bears to become aggressive at the next new\nhigh, as they were at bar 25. There was still some profit taking by the bulls, but very little new buying. The bears took control going into the close.\nBoth the strong bulls and bears looked forward to the final, strong breakout up to bar 19. They liked seeing a large bull spike after a protracted\nbull trend, because the expected correction provided both of them with a temporary trading opportunity. It was the third consecutive bull climax\nwithout a correction since the bar 11 low (bars 11 to 12 and 15 to 17 were the first two), and consecutive buy climaxes often lead to a two-legged\ncorrection lasting about 10 bars and falling below the moving average. Both the strong bulls and bears sold at the close of the two-bar bull spike\nbefore bar 19, above its high, at the close of bar 19 (especially since it had a bear body), and below its low. The bulls didn't look to buy again and\nthe bears did not take profits on their shorts until after the two-legged correction was complete, which was in the bar 21 to bar 24 area. The sell-off\nwas strong enough for both to think that the market might have a trend reversal into a bear trend after a lower high or higher high test of the bar 19\nbull high, and this resulted in the sell-off from bar 25 into the close.\nSince most reversal attempts fail, traders often fade them. Bar 22 was a strong bear trend bar in a bull trend, and many traders bought its close.\nTheir first target was a move to the high of the bar, which occurred two bars later, and then a measured move up, which was reached by the end of\nthe day.\nThe bear bar after bar 5 was a breakout mode setup. Since it was a bear bar after a bull breakout above the bar 3 swing high, it was a failed\nbreakout short setup. It was also a one-bar pullback in a bull breakout, so it was a high 1 breakout pullback buy setup. In this case, since the three-\nbar bull spike was so strong, it was more likely that the bulls would outnumber the bears both below and above the bar. Some bought at the low of\nthe bear inside bar with limit orders, whereas others bought above it and above bar 6 with stop orders.\nFigure PI.2 Low-Volume Bull Breakout in a Bear Trend\n", "text_clean": "to add to their shorts at a brief, high price, which represented correctly value to them.\nFigure PI.1 New Highs Find New Buyers, Profit Takers, and Shorts When a bull trend breaks above a prior swing high, there will be new buyers, profit takers, and shorts (see Figure PI.1). If the trend that preceded the breakout is starting out and is very strong, there will be some profit taking, like after bars 5, 12, and 17, but the new buyers will overwhelm the bears, and the trend will quickly resume. Later in the trend, there will be much less new buying and much more profit taking, like after bar 19. There are many measures of excess, and once enough trading firms believe that the bull trend is overdone, they will take profits on their longs and buy again only after about a 10-bar, two-legged correction. I use the phrase “10-bar, two-legged” often, and my intention is to say that the correction will last longer and be more complex than a small pullback. That usually requires at least 10 bars and two legs, and sometimes can result in a trend reversal.\nWhenever there is a breakout, it might fail and lead to a trend reversal. The chance of a successful reversal is greater if the context is right and the reversal bar is strong. If the breakout bar and spike leading to the breakout is stronger than the reversal bar, and the chance of a climactic reversal is not great, the odds are that the reversal attempt will fail within a few bars and form a breakout pullback setup that will lead to a resumption of the trend. For example, bar 12 was a small bear reversal bar, but it followed a much stronger three-bar bull spike and the market was trending up in a tight channel all day following a large gap up. This made the odds of a successful reversal small, so bulls bought at and below the low of bar 12. The next bar was a doji and therefore a weak entry bar for the bears, so there were almost certainly going to be more buyers than sellers above its high. It became a breakout pullback buy signal bar (here, a high 1 buy setup). The next bar was a bull bar, and more buyers bought above its high. In general, the odds of a successful buy signal are greater when traders wait to enter above a bull bar. Bar 14 was the breakout bar, but it closed on its low and formed a bear doji reversal bar, which is a weak sell signal in the face of such a tight bull channel. The bulls were so aggressive that they did not want the short to trigger. They placed limit orders at and above the low of the bear bar, and there were enough buy orders to overwhelm the bears. The short never triggered and the market continued to rally.

However, if a trader learns to identify one that is likely to be successful,\nthe trader's equation can be very strong.\nFigure 1.1 Breakouts Are Reliable Setups\nWhen a chart discussion runs for multiple pages, remember that you can go to the Wiley website (www.wiley.com/go/tradingranges) and either view\nthe chart or print it out, allowing you to read the description in the book without having to repeatedly flip pages back to see the chart.\nSuccessful breakouts, like the bull breakouts in Figure 1.1, have excellent math, but can be emotionally very difficult to trade. They happen quickly\nand traders instinctively know that the risk is to the bottom of the spike (they put their protective stop at one tick below the low of the lowest bar in\nthe bull spike, like below bar 14), which is often more than their usual risk tolerance. They want a pullback but know it will likely not come until the\nmarket is higher, and they are afraid to buy at the market because they are buying at the top of a spike. If the market reverses on the next tick, they\nwill have bought at the top of a spike and their protective stop is very far away. However, what they often fail to appreciate is that the math is on their\nside. Once there is a strong spike in a breakout like this, the probability of at least a measured move up based on the height of the spike is at least\n60 percent and may even sometimes be 80 percent. This means that they have at least a 60 percent chance of making at least as much as their\ninitial risk, and if the spike continues to grow after they enter, their risk stays the same but the measured move target gets higher and higher. For\nexample, if traders bought at the close of bar 15 on the 5 minute chart of the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures in Figure 1.1, they would risk to\none tick (one 64th of a point) below the bottom of the two-bar spike, which is one tick below the bar 14 low, or seven ticks below the entry price. At\nthis point, since the traders believed that the market was always-in long, they thought that there was at least a 60 percent chance of it being higher\nwithin a few bars. They should also have assumed that there would be at least a measured move up. Since the spike was six ticks tall, the market\nhad at least a 60 percent chance of trading up at least six ticks before falling to their protective stops.\nAt the close of bar 19, the spike had grown to 17 ticks tall and since it was still a breakout spike, there was still at least a 60 percent chance of at\nleast a measured move up. If traders were flat at this point, they could have bought small positions at the market and risked to one tick below the\nbar 14 bottom of the spike, or 18 ticks, to make 16 ticks (if the market went 17 ticks higher, they could get out with 16 ticks of profit). The traders\nwho bought the bar 15 close were still risking seven ticks to below the bar 14 low, but now had a 60 percent chance of the market trading 17 ticks\nabove the bar 19 high, which would be about a 28-tick profit (14 32nds). The spike ended at bar 19, once the next bar was a bear inside bar\ninstead of another strong bull trend bar. This was the first in a series of pullbacks in the channel phase of the bull trend. Bar 24 went above the\nmeasured move target, and the market traded even higher about an hour later.\nIn practice, most traders would have tightened their stops as the spike grew, so they would have risked less than what was just discussed. Many\ntraders who bought the bar 15 close might have raised their stops to below bar 17 once it closed because they would not have wanted the market\nto fall below such a strong bull trend bar. If it did, they would have believed that their premise was wrong and they would not want to risk a larger\nloss. When bar 19 closed and traders saw that it was a strong bull trend bar, many might have put their protective stops in the micro measuring gap\ncreated by the bar 17 breakout. The low of bar 18 was above the high of bar 16, and this gap is a sign of strength. Traders would want the market\nto continue up and not trade below bar 18 and into the gap, so some traders would have trailed their stop to below the bar 18 low. Many\nexperienced traders use spikes to press their trades. They add to their longs as the spike continues up, because they know that the spike has an\nexceptional trader's equation and that the great opportunity will be brief. A trader needs to be aggressive when the market is offering trades with\nstrong trader's equations. He also needs to trade little or not at all when it does not, like in a tight trading range.\nThe bull spike up from bar 5 flipped the market to always-in long for most traders. When the market traded above the bar 11 wedge bear flag\nhigh, it was likely to have approximately a measured move up. Bar 15 was a second consecutive strong bull trend bar and confirmed the breakout\nin the minds of many traders. Both bars 14 and 15 were strong bull trend bars with good-sized bodies and without significant tails. There was good\nbuying pressure all of the way up from the bar 5 low, as seen by many strong bull trend bars, little overlap, and only a few bear trend bars and the\nabsence of consecutive strong bear trend bars. The market might have been in the early stages of a bull trend, and smart traders were looking for a\nbull breakout. They were eager to get long once bars 14 and 15 broke out, and traders kept buying relentlessly in pieces all the way up to the bar 19\nhigh.\nThe most important thing that traders must force themselves to do, and it is usually difficult, is as soon as they believe that there is a reliable\n", "text_clean": "Chapter 1\nExample of How to Trade a Breakout Many beginners find breakouts difficult to trade because the market moves fast, requiring quick decisions, and often has large bars, which means that there is more risk and traders then have to reduce their position size.

They add to their longs as the spike continues up, because they know that the spike has an exceptional trader's equation and that the great opportunity will be brief. A trader needs to be aggressive when the market is offering trades with strong trader's equations. He also needs to trade little or not at all when it does not, like in a tight trading range.\nThe bull spike up from bar 5 flipped the market to always-in long for most traders. When the market traded above the bar 11 wedge bear flag high, it was likely to have approximately a measured move up. Bar 15 was a second consecutive strong bull trend bar and confirmed the breakout in the minds of many traders. Both bars 14 and 15 were strong bull trend bars with good-sized bodies and without significant tails. There was good buying pressure all of the way up from the bar 5 low, as seen by many strong bull trend bars, little overlap, and only a few bear trend bars and the absence of consecutive strong bear trend bars. The market might have been in the early stages of a bull trend, and smart traders were looking for a bull breakout. They were eager to get long once bars 14 and 15 broke out, and traders kept buying relentlessly in pieces all the way up to the bar 19 high.\nThe most important thing that traders must force themselves to do, and it is usually difficult, is as soon as they believe that there is a reliable", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["Chapter 1", "Example of How to Trade a Breakout", "Many beginners find breakouts difficult to trade because the market moves fast, requiring quick decisions, and often has large bars, which means", "that there is more risk and traders then have to reduce their position size.

When they feel themselves hoping for a pullback but fearing that it won't come for many\nmore bars, they should assume that the breakout is strong. They must decide where a worst-case protective stop would be, which is usually\nrelatively far away, and use that as their stop. Because the stop will be large, their initial position should be small if they are entering late. Once the\nmarket moves in their direction and they can tighten their stop, they can look to add to their position, but should never exceed their normal risk level.\nWhen everyone wants a pullback, it usually will not come for a long time. This is because everyone believes that the market will soon be higher but\nthey do not necessarily believe that it will be lower anytime soon. Smart traders know this and therefore they start buying in pieces. Since they have\nto risk to the bottom of the spike, they buy small. If their risk is three times normal, they will buy only one-third of their usual size to keep their\nabsolute risk within their normal range. When the strong bulls keep buying in small pieces, this buying pressure works against the formation of a\npullback. The strong bears see the trend and they, too, believe that the market will soon be higher. If they think it will be higher soon, they will stop\nlooking to short. It does not make sense for them to short if they think that they can short at a better price after a few more bars. So the strong bears\nare not shorting and the strong bulls are buying in small pieces, in case there is no pullback for a long time.\nWhat is the result? The market keeps working higher. Since you need to be doing what the smart traders are doing, you need to buy at least a\nsmall amount at the market or on a one- or two-tick pullback and risk to the bottom of the spike. Even if the pullback begins on the next tick, the\nodds are that it won't fall too far before smart bulls see it as value and they buy aggressively. Remember, everyone is waiting to buy a pullback, so\nwhen it finally comes it will only be small and not last long. All of those traders who have been waiting to buy will see this as the opportunity that they\nwanted. The result is that your position will once again be profitable very soon. Once the market goes high enough, you can look to take partial\nprofits or you can look to buy more on a pullback, which will probably be at a price above your original entry. The important point is that as soon as\nyou decide that buying a pullback is a great idea, you should do exactly what the strong bulls are doing and buy at least a small position at the\nmarket.\nSome traders like to buy breakouts as the market moves above a prior swing high, entering on a buy stop at one tick above the old high. In\ngeneral, the reward is greater, the risk is smaller, and the probability of success is higher when entering on pullbacks. If traders buy these\nbreakouts, they usually will then have to hold through a pullback before they can make much profit. It is usually better to buy the pullback than the\nbreakout. For example, rather than buying above bar 6 as the market moved up to bar 9, the trader's equation was probably stronger for a buy\nabove the bar 10 pullback instead.\nThe same is true for the bar 11 move above bar 9. With every breakout, traders have to decide if it will succeed or fail. If they believe that it will\nsucceed, they will look to buy the close of the breakout or follow-through bars, at and below the low of the prior bar, and above the high of the prior\nbar. If they believe that it will fail, they will not buy and if they are long, they will exit their positions. If they believe that the failure will trade down far\nenough for a scalp, they might go short for a scalp. If they think that the failure will lead to a trend reversal, they might look to swing a short down. In\nthis particular case, as the market moved strongly above the bar 9 and bar 11 double top, it was reasonable to buy the breakout, but traders who\nbought the close of bar 15 entered around the same price and had a more sound reason to take the trade (buying the close of a strong bull trend\nbar in a strong bull spike).\nIf any bull trend or breakout that does not look quite strong enough to buy near the top of the spike, like on the close of the most recent bar, the\ntrader's equation is stronger if traders instead wait to buy pullbacks. Bar 22 was the second bar of a breakout from an ii pattern and therefore the\nbeginning of a possible final flag reversal setup. This was likely a minor buy climax (discussed in book 3 in the chapter on climax reversals). At this\npoint, the trader's equation was stronger for buying a pullback than for buying the close of bar 22. The same was true for bar 24. As a trend\nbecomes more two-sided, it is better to look to buy pullbacks. Once the two-side trading becomes strong enough and the prior pullbacks have\nbeen deeper and lasted for more than five bars or so, traders can begin to short for scalps, like at the two bar reversal at bar 24 (shorting below the\nlow of then bear bar that followed). After the market has transitioned into a trading range, the bears will begin to short for swing trades, expecting\ndeeper pullbacks and a possible trend reversal.\nOther examples of breakout pullback buy setups in this bull trend include the bar 8 high 2 bull flag (a pullback from the rally to bar 6, which broke\nout of the bear channel from bar 3 to bar 5), the bar 12 high 2 at the moving average (bar 11 broke above the trading range and out of the bar 10\nhigh 1 bull flag; the first push down was the bear bar that formed two bars after bar 11), the bar 14 outside up bar (traders could have bought as it\nwent outside up, but the probability of success was higher if they bought above bar 14, because it was a bull trend bar), the bar 20 ii, the high 2 at\nbar 23 (bar 23 was the entry bar), and the bar 25 high 2 (all double bottoms are high 2 patterns). The signal bar is more reliable when it has a bull\nbody.\nIn general, whenever there is an initial pullback in a trend that has just become strongly always-in long, a trader should immediately place a buy\nstop to buy above the high of the spike. This is because many traders are afraid to buy below the low of the prior bar or above a high 1, thinking that\nthe market might have a two-legged pullback. However, if they wait for a two-legged pullback, they will miss many of the very strongest trends. To\nprevent themselves from being trapped out of a strong trend, traders need to get into the habit of placing that last-ditch buy stop. If they buy the high\n1, they can cancel their buy stop. But if they miss the earlier entries, at least they will get into the trend, which is what they need to do. By bar 19, the\ntrend was clearly very strong and was likely to continue up for about a measured move based on the height of the spike. As soon as the market\ngave a sign of a possible pullback, traders needed to place their worst-case entry buy stop orders above the spike high. The bar after bar 19 was a\nbear trend bar and a possible start of a pullback. They needed to place a buy stop at one tick above the bar 19 high, in case the trend quickly\nresumed. If they instead bought the bar 20 ii high 1 setup, they would have canceled the buy stop above bar 19. However, if they missed buying the\nhigh 1 for any reason, at least they would have been swept into the trend as the market moved to the new high. Their initial protective stop would\nhave been below the most recent minor pullback, which was the bar 20 low.\nBar 24 was a two-bar bull spike and the third consecutive buy climax without a correction. There was not enough time left in the day for a 10-bar,\ntwo-legged correction, so not many bears were willing to short it, especially since the move up from bars 5 and 12 had had so little selling pressure.\nHowever, some bulls used it as an opportunity to take profits, which turned out to be a reasonable decision, since the market did not get back\nabove its high for the rest of the day.\nTraders know that most attempts to reverse a trend fail, and many like to fade the attempts. The bar before bar 12 was a large bear trend bar,\nwhich was a break below the trend line and an attempt to reverse down from the bar 11 bull breakout. Bulls bought the close of the bear trend bar,\nexpecting a move back up to its high, and probably a measured move up equal to the height of the bar. Once they saw that bar 12 had a bull close,\nthey bought the close of bar 12 and above its high. A successful bear breakout usually is followed by another bear trend bar or at least a doji bar,\nand if there is instead a bull body, even a small one, the odds of a failed breakout attempt become higher, especially when the bar is at the moving\naverage in a bull trend. The bears wanted a bear channel after the bear spike, or some other type of bear trend, but the bulls saw the bear spike as\nan opportunity to buy during a brief discount. Bear spikes, especially on daily charts, can be due to news items, but most fail to have follow-through,\nand the longer-term bullish fundamentals win out, leading to a failed bear breakout and a resumption of the bull trend.

This is because trading range breakouts generally fail and the odds favor a move back into the\nmiddle of the range where the directional probability is neutral. That middle of the range is the target of the breakout, and its location is unknown\nuntil after it forms.\nA breakout begins with a trend bar, which can be large or small, but it is usually at least somewhat large compared to the size of the recent bars.\nRemember, all trend bars should be viewed as breakouts, spikes, gaps, and climaxes. When it is small, it is easy to dismiss its importance, but if it\nis followed by some sideways price action and then a steady directional move, a breakout is underway. The easiest breakouts to spot occur when\nan unusually large trend bar quickly moves the market out of a trading range and it is soon followed by other trend bars in the same direction.\nWhether the breakout is a single trend bar or a series of trend bars, it is a spike. As mentioned earlier, almost all trends can be considered to be\nsome type of spike and channel trend. For example, if a bull breakout bar has a strong close and the next several bars also have strong closes,\nsmall or nonexistent tails, and trending highs and lows (no pullback bars), and there is very little overlap between the bodies of consecutive bull\ntrend bars, then the market will likely be higher than it is at the current moment at some point before the market reverses back beyond the start of\nthe breakout move. If the trend continues, eventually its momentum will slow and there will generally be some type of channel.\nOne of the most important concepts in trading is that most breakouts fail. Because of this, entering on every breakout in the direction of the\nbreakout is a losing strategy. However, there are often price action events that increase the likelihood that a breakout will succeed. For example, if\nthere is a strong bear trend and then a two-legged rally to the moving average, going short on the downside breakout of this bear flag is a sensible\ntrade. However, if the market is not in a trend and there are lots of overlapping bars and many bars with large tails, the market is in balance. Both\nthe bulls and the bears are comfortable taking positions and a trading range is developing. If the market then has a bull trend bar that extends to the\ntop of or even above the trading range, the bears who were happy to sell in the middle of the range are going to be even more aggressive at this\nbetter price. Also, the bulls who were happy to buy in the middle of the range will become hesitant to buy higher and instead will be quick to exit at\nthe top of the range. This behavior by the bulls and the bears creates a magnetic pull in the middle of the range, and the result is that most of the\ntrading will be in the middle of the range. Even once the market successfully breaks out and travels for maybe a measured move equal to the height\nof the range, the magnetic pull will still tend to draw the market back into the range. This is what makes final flag reversals so reliable (discussed in\nbook 3).\nIf you look at any chart, you will notice lots of bull and bear trend bars with relatively large bodies and small tails. Each of these is a breakout\nattempt and almost all fail to lead to a trend, and instead the trading range continues. On a 5 minute Emini chart, these probably represent buy and\nsell programs trying to move the market. Some algorithms are designed to fade these trend bars, expecting most to fail. Experienced traders will\ndo this as well when they believe that the breakout will probably fail. For example, if there is a breakout in the form of a large bull trend bar, these\nprograms might short on the close of the bar, above its high, on the close of the next bar or two, or below their lows. If enough program trading\ndollars come in on the fade side (the sell side), they will overwhelm those programs that are trying to initiate the bull trend, and the trading range will\ncontinue. Eventually, a breakout will succeed. The breakout bar will be large, the pullbacks as the bar is forming will be small, and the breakout will\nhave good follow-through over the next several bars. The programs that are trying to fade the move are failing and they will cover their losing\npositions and drive the trend further. The strength will attract other trend traders, many of whom are momentum traders and quickly enter whenever\nthey see momentum.\nOnce everyone is convinced that the market is now trending, it might go far before there is a pullback. Why is that? Consider an example of a\nmarket breaking into a strong bull trend with a spike formed by three strong bull trend bars. Traders believe that the market will be higher at some\npoint before long and they are not confident that it will be lower within the next few bars. This makes bears buy back their shorts, lifting the market\neven more. Bulls who are underinvested believe the market is going higher in the near term and that they will make more money by simply buying at\nthe market or on a two- or three-tick pullback than they would if they waited for an eight- or 10-tick pullback or a pullback to the moving average.\nThis also lifts the market. Since bulls and bears are both essentially buying at the market as it is going up, the pullback never comes, or at least it\ndoes not come for five or more bars after the market is well above the current price.\nThis is discussed in more detail in Chapter 8, but traders are willing to buy at the market at any time in a breakout because they believe that the\nodds are better than 50–50 that they will make at least as many points as they are risking. When the breakout is strong, the probability is usually 60\nto 70 percent or more. If they buy the 5 minute Emini on the high tick when the top of the spike is four points above the low of the spike, they believe\nthat the odds are probably 60 percent or better that the market will go up four more points before their four-point stop is hit. How can you be sure of\nthis? Because it is mathematically unwise to have your risk equal your reward if the chance of success is much less than 60 percent, and\ninstitutions would therefore not be taking this trade. Since the market is still going up, then institutions are taking the trade. Since the trade remains\nvalid as long as the market stays above the bottom of the spike, they are risking to the bottom of the spike. They know that the spike usually goes\nup to about a measured move, so their profit target, which is their reward, is equal to their risk. If the spike grows another two points before\npausing, the spike is then six points tall. If that is the end of the spike, they will assume that there is about a 60 percent chance that the market will\ngo another six points higher before it falls six points. This means that all of the bulls who bought lower have a 60 percent chance that the market will\ngo another six points higher before their four-point stop is hit. For example, the bulls who bought when the spike was four points tall are now risking\nfour points to make a total of eight points on a 60 percent bet, which is a great mathematical situation. They expect that the market has a 60\npercent chance of testing six points above the close of the spike, which is two points above their entry, giving them an eight-point profit target.\nWhen a breakout is successful and leads to a trend, the momentum slows after the initial fast move, and signs of two-sided trading develop, like\noverlapping bars, increasing tails, trend bars in the opposite direction, and pullback bars. Even though the trend may continue for a long time, this\npart of the trend usually gets retraced and becomes part of a trading range. For example, in a spike and channel bull trend pattern, the spike is the\nbreakout and the channel usually becomes the first leg of a trading range and therefore will usually be retraced. Typically, the market eventually pulls\nback all the way to the start of the channel, completing the second leg of the incipient trading range. In the example of that bull breakout, the market\nwill then usually try to bounce off that support. This results in a double bottom bull flag that sometimes leads to a breakout above the new range, and\nother times it evolves into a protracted trading range like a tight trading range or a triangle. Less often, it is followed by a reversal.\nOn the 5 minute Emini chart, there are usually many attempts to break out every day but most fail after one or two trend bars. They most likely\nrepresent the start of a program trade by some institution, but they get overwhelmed by opposite programs by other institutions. When enough\ninstitutions have programs running in the same direction at the same time, their programs will be able to move the market to a new price level and\nthe breakout will be successful. However, nothing is ever 100 percent certain and even the strongest breakouts fail about 30 percent of the time.\nWhen a breakout is very strong, there will be three or more trend bars with small tails and very little overlap. This means that traders are not\nwaiting for a significant pullback. They are afraid that there might not be a pullback until after the market has run a long way, and they want to be\ncertain to capture at least part of the trend. They will enter at the market and on tiny pullbacks of one or two ticks, and their relentless orders will give\nthe trend strength and work against the formation of a significant pullback.\n", "text_clean": "a reversal when it reaches the end of the channel.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 41, "text_raw": "The breakout bars often have large volume and sometimes they will have 10 to 20 times the volume of an average bar. The higher the volume\nand the more bars in the spike, the more likely it is that there will be significant follow-through. Prior to the breakout, both the bulls and the bears\nwere scaling into their positions, fighting over control of the market and each trying to create a successful breakout in their direction. Once there is a\nclear breakout, the losing side will cover their large position quickly with a loss, and the winning side will enter even more aggressively. The result is\none or more trend bars, often with high volume. Volume is not always especially high but when it is 10 or more times the average of the recent bars,\nthe probability of a successful breakout, meaning that there will be follow-through for many bars, is higher. Also, volume can be unusually high on\nbreakouts that fail within a few bars, but this is less common. Volume is not reliable enough to warrant following it, and the large trend bars that\ncomprise the spike will already tell you whether the breakout is likely to be successful. Trying to think about the volume in addition will, more often\nthan not, distract you and hinder your ability to trade at your best.\nAll successful breakouts should be viewed as spikes, since most are followed by channels and create a spike and channel trend pattern.\nHowever, the breakout can also fail and the trading range that preceded it then becomes a final flag, if it was a flag in a trend. In fact, most\nbreakouts do fail but the breakout bar is so unremarkable that most traders don't even realize that there was an attempted breakout. Less\ncommonly, the market can enter a tight trading range after the breakout, and this is usually followed by trend resumption, but sometimes the\nbreakout of that tight trading range can be in the other direction, resulting in a reversal.\nA breakout can be a single large trend bar or a series of large or small trend bars, and the breakout usually becomes part of one of the trend\npatterns previously discussed. For example, if there is a “trend from the open” bear trend, it is likely a breakout below a pattern from the previous\nday. If the trend is orderly, it might be followed by a tight trading range for several hours and then the day could turn into a trend resumption bear into\nthe close. If instead the breakout is accelerating to the downside with each bar resulting in a steeper slope, and the chart assumes a parabolic and\ntherefore climactic look, it might be followed by a pullback and then a channel. The day could become a spike and channel bear trend day.\nSometimes, after the market has been in a strong trend for many bars, it creates an unusually large trend bar in the direction of the trend. That\nlarge bar typically either becomes a breakout into an even steeper, stronger trend, or at least another leg in the trend, or can signify a climactic end\nof the trend. If the market pulls back for a few bars and does not retrace too much of the breakout bar, the odds of the breakout being successful\nare good, and traders will enter on the high 1 breakout pullback if this was a bull breakout (or short a low 1 in a bear breakout).\nThe trend can continue even if the pullback retraces beyond the breakout point, but the deeper the pullback, the more likely it is that the breakout\nwill fail and the market will reverse. In this case, the large bar will represent a climactic end of the trend rather than a breakout. If the pullback is fairly\ndeep, traders might hesitate to enter with the trend for an hour or so. For example, if there is a large bull trend bar that breaks above a swing high or\ntrading range but the pullback is fairly deep, maybe a little below the top of the swing high, traders will not be certain if the breakout has failed or if\nthe rally is just a little overdone. The bulls in this case often will not buy for about 10 bars or so and the market will frequently enter a small trading\nrange. Instead of buying a high 1, they will likely wait for a high 2, especially if it forms after an hour or so. If the trading range is holding above the\nmoving average and about an hour has passed, bulls will look to buy a two-legged sideways or down pullback. Sometimes the sideways move is\nfollowed by a second leg down. That second leg can lead to a new high, or to a trend reversal and more selling.\nOnce there is a pullback, which is a small trading range, traders will look for the trend to resume. The breakout from the pullback has an initial\ntarget of an approximate measured move equal to about the height of the trading range. Many traders will take partial or total profits in that area,\nand aggressive countertrend traders will initiate new positions.\nThe easiest breakout failures to spot are those where the market quickly reverses direction and does not make any significant attempt to\ncontinue in the direction of the breakout. This is more likely to happen when there is other evidence of a possible reversal, like a breakout above a\ntrend channel line and then a reversal down with a strong signal bar.\nThe breakout can be of anything, such as a trend line, a trading range, or the high or low of the day or yesterday. It does not matter because they\nare all traded the same. Fade it if it fails and reenter in the direction of the breakout if the reversal attempt fails and therefore becomes a breakout\npullback. Enter on the breakout only if it is very strong. An example of this is if there is a strong bull trend and then a two-bar pullback to a high 1 buy\nsetup. Traders can buy at one tick above the high of the prior bar, and they can buy more on a breakout to a new high by placing an order to buy on\na stop at one tick above the old high. Usually, however, it is better to buy a pullback or to look to short a failed breakout.\nOn most days, traders look at new swing highs and lows as possible fade setups. On a strong trend day, however, the breakouts are usually on\nhuge volume and there is very little pullback even on a 1 minute chart. It is clear that the trend traders are in control. For example, when a bull trend\nis that strong, price action traders will be buying on high 1 and high 2 pullbacks instead of waiting for a breakout above the prior high of the trend.\nThey are always trying to minimize the risk of the trade. However, once a strong trend is underway, entering with the trend for any reason is a good\ntrade. In a strong trend, every tick is a with-trend entry, so you can simply enter at the market at any point and use a reasonable stop.\nIf there is a breakout with a large trend bar and the bar has not yet closed, you have a decision to make. If you just scalped out of part of your\ntrade and are now thinking about swinging the remainder, always consider how much risk you have. One way to help decide if you should continue\nto hold your swing position is to ask yourself what you would do at this moment if you were not holding a position. If you would be willing to enter at\nthe market using a swing-size position and the swing protective stop, then you should stay in your current swing position. If instead you think that it\nwould be too risky to enter at the market with that amount of risk, then you should exit your swing position at the market.\nWhen there is a breakout, both buyers and sellers see it as an opportunity. For example, if the market has a swing high and then pulls back, both\nbulls and bears will enter as the market moves above that prior swing high. Bulls will be buying the breakout because they see it as a sign of\nstrength and they believe the market will go high enough above their entry for them to exit with a profit. Bears will also see the breakout as an\nopportunity to make money. For example, bears might sell on a limit order at the level of that prior high or maybe a few ticks above it. If the market\nreverses and comes down, they will look to exit with a profit. If, however, the market continues up, they will look to add to their short position if they\nthink the market might pull back to test the breakout. Since most pullbacks come all the way back to the prior swing high, they can exit on that\nbreakout test at about breakeven on their first entry and with a profit on their second, higher entry.\nWhen traders think of breakouts they usually immediately have the image of a trading range. However, the breakout can be of anything. One\ncommon breakout that many traders overlook is a flag breaking out in the unexpected direction, like a bear flag breaking out of the top or a bull flag\nbreaking out of a bottom. For example, if there is a reasonably strong bear trend and traders are not sure if a tradable low is in and they see a bear\nflag forming, they might start buying below the low of the prior bars, expecting a low 1 and then a low 2 or even a low 3 to fail. Sometimes the bear\nflag will have a good shape and trigger the low 2 short or the wedge bear flag short and then immediately reverse up into one or two bull trend bars.\nThis breakout usually creates a measuring gap that leads to a measured move up. Traders will enter on the breakout and on any small pullback;\nand since bears were trapped, they will likely not be eager to short again until the market has had at least two legs up. The opposite is true of bull\nflags in bull trends.\nThere is a special type of breakout that sometimes occurs on trend days in the final hour. For example, if the market is trending down with no sign\n", "text_clean": "The breakout bars often have large volume and sometimes they will have 10 to 20 times the volume of an average bar. The higher the volume and the more bars in the spike, the more likely it is that there will be significant follow-through. Prior to the breakout, both the bulls and the bears were scaling into their positions, fighting over control of the market and each trying to create a successful breakout in their direction. Once there is a clear breakout, the losing side will cover their large position quickly with a loss, and the winning side will enter even more aggressively. The result is one or more trend bars, often with high volume. Volume is not always especially high but when it is 10 or more times the average of the recent bars, the probability of a successful breakout, meaning that there will be follow-through for many bars, is higher. Also, volume can be unusually high on breakouts that fail within a few bars, but this is less common. Volume is not reliable enough to warrant following it, and the large trend bars that comprise the spike will already tell you whether the breakout is likely to be successful. Trying to think about the volume in addition will, more often than not, distract you and hinder your ability to trade at your best.\nAll successful breakouts should be viewed as spikes, since most are followed by channels and create a spike and channel trend pattern.\nHowever, the breakout can also fail and the trading range that preceded it then becomes a final flag, if it was a flag in a trend. In fact, most breakouts do fail but the breakout bar is so unremarkable that most traders don't even realize that there was an attempted breakout. Less commonly, the market can enter a tight trading range after the breakout, and this is usually followed by trend resumption, but sometimes the breakout of that tight trading range can be in the other direction, resulting in a reversal.\nA breakout can be a single large trend bar or a series of large or small trend bars, and the breakout usually becomes part of one of the trend patterns previously discussed. For example, if there is a “trend from the open” bear trend, it is likely a breakout below a pattern from the previous day. If the trend is orderly, it might be followed by a tight trading range for several hours and then the day could turn into a trend resumption bear into the close. If instead the breakout is accelerating to the downside with each bar resulting in a steeper slope, and the chart assumes a parabolic and therefore climactic look, it might be followed by a pullback and then a channel. The day could become a spike and channel bear trend day.\nSometimes, after the market has been in a strong trend for many bars, it creates an unusually large trend bar in the direction of the trend. That large bar typically either becomes a breakout into an even steeper, stronger trend, or at least another leg in the trend, or can signify a climactic end of the trend. If the market pulls back for a few bars and does not retrace too much of the breakout bar, the odds of the breakout being successful are good, and traders will enter on the high 1 breakout pullback if this was a bull breakout (or short a low 1 in a bear breakout).\nThe trend can continue even if the pullback retraces beyond the breakout point, but the deeper the pullback, the more likely it is that the breakout will fail and the market will reverse. In this case, the large bar will represent a climactic end of the trend rather than a breakout. If the pullback is fairly deep, traders might hesitate to enter with the trend for an hour or so. For example, if there is a large bull trend bar that breaks above a swing high or trading range but the pullback is fairly deep, maybe a little below the top of the swing high, traders will not be certain if the breakout has failed or if the rally is just a little overdone. The bulls in this case often will not buy for about 10 bars or so and the market will frequently enter a small trading range. Instead of buying a high 1, they will likely wait for a high 2, especially if it forms after an hour or so. If the trading range is holding above the moving average and about an hour has passed, bulls will look to buy a two-legged sideways or down pullback. Sometimes the sideways move is followed by a second leg down. That second leg can lead to a new high, or to a trend reversal and more selling.\nOnce there is a pullback, which is a small trading range, traders will look for the trend to resume. The breakout from the pullback has an initial target of an approximate measured move equal to about the height of the trading range. Many traders will take partial or total profits in that area, and aggressive countertrend traders will initiate new positions.\nThe easiest breakout failures to spot are those where the market quickly reverses direction and does not make any significant attempt to continue in the direction of the breakout. This is more likely to happen when there is other evidence of a possible reversal, like a breakout above a trend channel line and then a reversal down with a strong signal bar.\nThe breakout can be of anything, such as a trend line, a trading range, or the high or low of the day or yesterday. It does not matter because they are all traded the same. Fade it if it fails and reenter in the direction of the breakout if the reversal attempt fails and therefore becomes a breakout pullback. Enter on the breakout only if it is very strong. An example of this is if there is a strong bull trend and then a two-bar pullback to a high 1 buy setup. Traders can buy at one tick above the high of the prior bar, and they can buy more on a breakout to a new high by placing an order to buy on a stop at one tick above the old high. Usually, however, it is better to buy a pullback or to look to short a failed breakout.\nOn most days, traders look at new swing highs and lows as possible fade setups. On a strong trend day, however, the breakouts are usually on huge volume and there is very little pullback even on a 1 minute chart. It is clear that the trend traders are in control. For example, when a bull trend is that strong, price action traders will be buying on high 1 and high 2 pullbacks instead of waiting for a breakout above the prior high of the trend.\nThey are always trying to minimize the risk of the trade. However, once a strong trend is underway, entering with the trend for any reason is a good trade. In a strong trend, every tick is a with-trend entry, so you can simply enter at the market at any point and use a reasonable stop.\nIf there is a breakout with a large trend bar and the bar has not yet closed, you have a decision to make. If you just scalped out of part of your trade and are now thinking about swinging the remainder, always consider how much risk you have. One way to help decide if you should continue to hold your swing position is to ask yourself what you would do at this moment if you were not holding a position. If you would be willing to enter at the market using a swing-size position and the swing protective stop, then you should stay in your current swing position. If instead you think that it would be too risky to enter at the market with that amount of risk, then you should exit your swing position at the market.\nWhen there is a breakout, both buyers and sellers see it as an opportunity. For example, if the market has a swing high and then pulls back, both bulls and bears will enter as the market moves above that prior swing high. Bulls will be buying the breakout because they see it as a sign of strength and they believe the market will go high enough above their entry for them to exit with a profit. Bears will also see the breakout as an opportunity to make money. For example, bears might sell on a limit order at the level of that prior high or maybe a few ticks above it. If the market reverses and comes down, they will look to exit with a profit. If, however, the market continues up, they will look to add to their short position if they think the market might pull back to test the breakout. Since most pullbacks come all the way back to the prior swing high, they can exit on that breakout test at about breakeven on their first entry and with a profit on their second, higher entry.\nWhen traders think of breakouts they usually immediately have the image of a trading range. However, the breakout can be of anything. One common breakout that many traders overlook is a flag breaking out in the unexpected direction, like a bear flag breaking out of the top or a bull flag breaking out of a bottom. For example, if there is a reasonably strong bear trend and traders are not sure if a tradable low is in and they see a bear flag forming, they might start buying below the low of the prior bars, expecting a low 1 and then a low 2 or even a low 3 to fail. Sometimes the bear flag will have a good shape and trigger the low 2 short or the wedge bear flag short and then immediately reverse up into one or two bull trend bars.\nThis breakout usually creates a measuring gap that leads to a measured move up. Traders will enter on the breakout and on any small pullback; and since bears were trapped, they will likely not be eager to short again until the market has had at least two legs up. The opposite is true of bull flags in bull trends.\nThere is a special type of breakout that sometimes occurs on trend days in the final hour.

Strictly\nspeaking, if the high of a bar is above the high of any prior bar or the low of the bar is below the low of any prior bar, it is a breakout of that bar.\nAlso, every trend bar is a breakout (remember from book 1, every trend bar is a spike, breakout, gap, and climax). Many different types of\nbreakouts and failures are highlighted on this chart.\nBar 1 broke above a trend channel line and was followed by a breakout below its low on the next bar, setting up a two-bar reversal, which was\ntriggered on the bar 3 entry bar. Bar 2 was a second attempt to break out above the bull channel and it broke out above another two-bar reversal\nbut the breakouts failed and the market reversed down.\nBar 4 was a breakout below a swing low and it was the sixth bar is a sell climax down from bar 2. Since the range of the bar was large and it had\nsmall tails, it might represent a sell climax that needed a correction before there was follow-through selling. This turned out to be the case, because\nbar 5 was a strong bull reversal bar that turned bar 4 into a failed breakout.\nThere was a two-legged pullback to the moving average and bar 8 broke out of the bear flag.\nBar 9 broke above the bear trend line.\nBar 10 broke above a swing high but the breakout failed when the next bar traded below its low.\nBar 12 fell below the bar 9 entry bar and below the signal bar just before it.\nBar 13 tried to reverse back up and create a failed breakout, but that failed breakout failed on the bar 14 reversal back down. Bar 14 was also a\nreversal down from the failed breakout above a micro trend line and above a bull reversal bar. When a failed breakout fails to reverse the market, it\nbecomes a breakout pullback.\nThe bar 16 break above the bear trend line failed and the bar reversed down into an outside down reversal, falling below the bear flag trend line\nof the prior three bars.\nBars 16 to 18 created a four-bar breakout composed of strong bear trend bars with large bodies, small tails, and very little overlap. The bulls who\nscaled into longs within the trading range finally capitulated and not only stopped buying, but had to sell out of their large long positions quickly\nwithout waiting for a pullback. They were not confident that a pullback would come soon and were confident that the market would be lower within a\nfew bars. This means that getting out at the market or on a tiny pullback within the bar was their best option. Their long liquidation and their lack of\nbuying for several bars contributed to the strength of the sell-off. When a breakout is that strong, it usually is followed by a channel and often leads to\na measured move from the open of the first bar to the close of the final bar in the spike. The bar 36 low was just below that measured move\nprojection, and that ended the channel. The market then usually works its way back up to test the first reasonable buy signal after the spike, which\nwas the high of the bar 19 bull inside bar. If it gets there, it next tries to test the start of the bear channel, which was the bar 20 high.\nBar 20 was an attempt to make the four-bar breakout fail but when a breakout is that strong, there is usually follow-through and the failure will\ntypically fail and just become a breakout pullback, as it did here. The market reversed back down just shy of the bar 15 breakout point and the\nmoving average.

There might be a long scalp or two, but a trader should take them only if the trader is able to immediately reverse back to short as soon as\na bar falls below the low of the prior bar, indicating that the small pullback might be ending. Incidentally, Elliott Wave traders see the pullback as the\ntop of wave 4 and the breakout point as the bottom of wave 1. The two cannot overlap if the downward wave 3 in between is in fact wave 3, which is\nusually the strongest wave of the trend.\nBar 22 was a large-range bear bar that broke below the bottom of a four-bar channel. It was arguably the third consecutive sell climax (the first\nwas bar 14 and the second was the four-bar spike down to bar 18). The market usually has at least a 10-bar, two-legged correction after two or\nthree consecutive climaxes. Here, however, that four-bar bear spike was the overwhelming feature of the day and was the beginning of a strong\nbreakout. Yes, it was a spike and therefore a sell climax, but it was so large that the character of the market changed and any counting has to start\nall over. Once it formed, traders decided that there was going to be a strong move down, and a channel is the most common pattern that follows a\nstrong spike. Channels often have three pushes before they correct, and this one did as well. The three pushes were bars 18, 25, and 36, and they\nwere followed by a weak rally into the close.\nBar 23 was a reversal attempt after the bar 22 sell climax and overshoot through the bottom of the three-bar bear channel. However, it is a\nmistake to be looking for a long based on these few bars when the big picture is so bearish. The market is always trying to reverse trends, and it is\neasy to get caught up in the emotion of a bottoming pattern as it happens in real time; but you should never lose sight of the big picture. That four-\nbar bear spike was very strong, and the always-in position is still short. Any attempt at a bottom at this point will almost certainly result in a bear flag,\nas it did here. The market always has inertia, and when it is trending, expect all reversal attempts to fail.\nBar 25 was a second attempt to reverse up after the breakout below the bars 20 to 21 channel. Since the signal bars for both attempts had\nstrong bull bodies, the market might test the moving average. Most traders should not take this trade and instead should stay short. Too often,\ntraders will scalp the countertrend trade for a point and then do not reverse back to short, and they miss out on making four or more points on the\nwith-trend trade. It can be difficult to change your mind-set quickly back to short if you just went long, and if you cannot do this easily, do not take the\ncountertrend scalp and then miss the swing down.\nBar 26 broke out of the top of the channel, as expected.\nBar 27 broke above the bear trend line and above the bar 18 breakout point but failed and reversed down on the next bar.\nBar 28 was a breakout of a three-bar bear flag.\nBar 29 broke below the bar 26 long entry bar but it found buyers, as seen by the large tail.\nBar 32 was another test of a bear trend line and therefore an attempted breakout, but it failed.\nBar 35 was another large bear trend bar and therefore another possible sell climax. When the market begins to form second and third sell\nclimaxes within a short time, it is likely to reverse for at least a two-legged correction.\nBar 36 broke below the measured move but did not find sellers. Instead, it found quiet trading, which might be signaling a failed breakout of the\nbars 22 to 34 bear flag.

This breakout also led to a measured\nmove up.

There might be a long scalp or two, but a trader should take them only if the trader is able to immediately reverse back to short as soon as a bar falls below the low of the prior bar, indicating that the small pullback might be ending. Incidentally, Elliott Wave traders see the pullback as the top of wave 4 and the breakout point as the bottom of wave 1. The two cannot overlap if the downward wave 3 in between is in fact wave 3, which is usually the strongest wave of the trend.\nBar 22 was a large-range bear bar that broke below the bottom of a four-bar channel. It was arguably the third consecutive sell climax (the first was bar 14 and the second was the four-bar spike down to bar 18). The market usually has at least a 10-bar, two-legged correction after two or three consecutive climaxes. Here, however, that four-bar bear spike was the overwhelming feature of the day and was the beginning of a strong breakout. Yes, it was a spike and therefore a sell climax, but it was so large that the character of the market changed and any counting has to start all over. Once it formed, traders decided that there was going to be a strong move down, and a channel is the most common pattern that follows a strong spike. Channels often have three pushes before they correct, and this one did as well. The three pushes were bars 18, 25, and 36, and they were followed by a weak rally into the close.\nBar 23 was a reversal attempt after the bar 22 sell climax and overshoot through the bottom of the three-bar bear channel. However, it is a mistake to be looking for a long based on these few bars when the big picture is so bearish. The market is always trying to reverse trends, and it is easy to get caught up in the emotion of a bottoming pattern as it happens in real time; but you should never lose sight of the big picture. That fourbar bear spike was very strong, and the always-in position is still short. Any attempt at a bottom at this point will almost certainly result in a bear flag, as it did here. The market always has inertia, and when it is trending, expect all reversal attempts to fail.\nBar 25 was a second attempt to reverse up after the breakout below the bars 20 to 21 channel. Since the signal bars for both attempts had strong bull bodies, the market might test the moving average. Most traders should not take this trade and instead should stay short. Too often, traders will scalp the countertrend trade for a point and then do not reverse back to short, and they miss out on making four or more points on the with-trend trade. It can be difficult to change your mind-set quickly back to short if you just went long, and if you cannot do this easily, do not take the countertrend scalp and then miss the swing down.\nBar 26 broke out of the top of the channel, as expected.\nBar 27 broke above the bear trend line and above the bar 18 breakout point but failed and reversed down on the next bar.\nBar 28 was a breakout of a three-bar bear flag.\nBar 29 broke below the bar 26 long entry bar but it found buyers, as seen by the large tail.\nBar 32 was another test of a bear trend line and therefore an attempted breakout, but it failed.\nBar 35 was another large bear trend bar and therefore another possible sell climax. When the market begins to form second and third sell climaxes within a short time, it is likely to reverse for at least a two-legged correction.\nBar 36 broke below the measured move but did not find sellers. Instead, it found quiet trading, which might be signaling a failed breakout of the bars 22 to 34 bear flag. A horizontal bear flag after a long bear trend often becomes a final flag and is typically followed by at least two legs sideways to up. Bar 36 was also the third push down in the bear channel and that usually leads to at least a reversal attempt.\nThe bar after bar 36 broke above the bar 36 high and became the entry bar for the long.\nBar 37 was a bull breakout bar above the bear trend line.\nBar 38 broke above the strong bar 35 bear trend bar, and there were certainly many buy stops for shorts above this bar because its large bear body represented strong selling.

The exact probability is\nnever knowable, but from experience this is a very strong breakout and the probability of the measured move is likely greater than 70 percent here.\nThe measured move up from the open of bar 1 to the close of bar 4 was the price level where the market paused at the top of bar 8. The measured\nmove based on the open of bar 1 to the close of bar 8 was exceeded by 3 cents on the close of the day (not shown).\nFigure 3.2 Successful Breakouts Need Follow-Through\nBreakouts are common on the 5 minute Emini chart, but strong, successful ones that have several bars of follow-through, like at bar 1 and bar 11 in\nFigure 3.2, usually happen only one to three times a day.\nBar 1 broke above the top of a small wedge, and it had a small tail at the top and bottom and was a large bull trend bar.\nBar 2 was a small bear inside bar and is a signal bar both for a failed breakout short and a breakout pullback long. Remember that an inside bar\nis a one-bar trading range and a setup for a breakout in either direction. Breakouts often lead to measured moves, and one common pattern is a\nmeasured move from the open or low of the spike to the close or high of the spike, and then projected up from the close or high of the spike. Here,\nthe move to the bar 3 high of the day was a measured move from the open to the close of the bar 1 breakout bar.\nThe opening range often leads to a breakout to a measured move, but there are usually several possibilities for the measurement points and it is\nbest to watch the nearest target first. Traders should look at the low of bar 4 to the high of bar 5. Once that measured move was exceeded, traders\nshould look at other possibilities. A failed wedge often leads to a measured move, but traders need to consider every option that they can see. For\nexample, they might look at the low of bar 7 to the high of the wedge (two bars after bar 9). However, the wedge began at bar 4, and the bar 7 lower\nlow might be viewed as an overshoot of the actual bar 4 low. The market tried to form a wedge bear flag beginning at the bar 4 low, and it had three\npushes up (bar 5, and the spikes before and after bar 9). Using the bar 4 low to the top of the wedge for the measurement projected a move that\nwas exceeded by only one tick at the bar 14 high of the day. The purpose of finding these measured move targets is to find reasonable areas to\ntake profits, and, if there is a strong countertrend setup, to initiate trades in the opposite direction.\nBar 6 was a strong breakout to a new low of the day, but it was reversed up by the bar 7 outside up bull trend bar. When traders saw the\nsideways action to bar 8, they were thinking that this was a possible breakout pullback (a bear flag) and it could be followed by another move down.\nYou must always consider both bull and bear alternatives. Instead of more selling, the market moved up quickly. How can such a strong bear trend\nbar be reversed up so quickly? If the institutions had a huge number of buy orders, they would like to fill them at the best prices, and if they thought\nthat the market was likely to test below the bar 4 low before going up, they would wait to buy until after that test. As the market is getting close to\ntheir buy zone, it does not make sense for them to buy because they believe the market will be a little lower over the next several minutes. So these\nvery eager bulls are stepping aside. The absence of the strongest buyers creates an imbalance to the sell side, so the market has to fall quickly for\nthe shorts to find someone willing to take the other side of their trade. The result is a large bear trend bar. Once the market is at a level where the\nbulls think it will not fall further, they appear out of nowhere and begin to buy heavily and relentlessly, overwhelming the bears. The bears realize\nwhat is going on and they stop shorting and begin to buy back their shorts. This means that both the bulls and the bears believe that the market will\ngo up, and this creates a directional probability of an equidistant move of 60 percent or more in favor of the bulls. In other words, there is a 60\npercent or more chance that the market will go up two points before falling two points, and up three points before falling three points. In fact, there is\nprobably better than a 60 percent chance that the market will break out above the opening range and have a measured move up before there is a\ntwo-point pullback, and this is a great trade for the bulls.\nBars 9 and 10 were breakout pullbacks after new highs of the day.\nBar 11 was a breakout of the wedge that began with the bar 5 high. It was a strong two-bar bull spike, and it was followed by two more pushes\nup. Bull channels after spikes often have three pushes up, where the top of the spike is the first push up.\nBar 12 was a two-legged high 2 breakout pullback in a strong bull trend and is a great buy setup.\nBar 13 was another breakout pullback but since it would lead to a third push up, bulls had to be cautious. Once bar 14 hit five ticks above the long\nentry, many bulls moved their stops to breakeven because they were wondering if the bar 14 wedge high would lead to a lengthy (10 bars or more)\ntwo-legged pullback or even a trend reversal. Therefore, bar 15 was a bad signal for longs, who expected that any rally would end below the bar 14\nwedge high and be followed by at least one more leg down.

They are risking six ticks to\nmake eight ticks and are 60 percent confident that they will win, and this is a logical bet.\nBar 16 was a bear breakout below a head and shoulders top, but since most topping patterns are really just bull flags, there was a good chance\nthat the breakout would fail. Bulls could have bought above the small doji inside bar that followed, but this would be somewhat risky because doji\nbars are not reliable signal bars.

Traders who memorize candle reversal patterns will be eager to buy these very large candles\nwith long bull tails because they will see the long tails and the closes near the highs as evidence that the bulls were gaining control. When you see a\nbig bar with a long tail and a small body in a bear trend, it tells you that if you buy above its high, you are paying way too much. In a bear trend, you\nwant to buy low, not at the top of a huge bar with a small body when the market is in a tight bear channel and there has been no prior bull strength or\ntrend line break. Bar 5 was an even better candle pattern trap than bar 3 since it was a gravestone doji, which candle novices worship.

Just wait for the small bar that usually follows. Its lack of upside\nfollow-through makes these early bulls very scared. Everyone knows where those bulls are putting their protective stops, so that is exactly where you\nshould be putting your entry stop to go short.

Traders then knew that the bulls were getting eager to buy, so a perfect long setup\nwould be a failed breakout to new lows. Smart traders just waited for a one- or two-bar break below bars 3 and 5 and then started placing buy\norders at one tick above the high of the prior bar. They were prepared to keep moving the orders down if they didn't get filled. If the move continued\ntoo far down, they would have waited for another trend line break before looking to buy again because the trend would have resumed and this setup\nwould have failed to trigger. The earlier bulls with two or three losses would wait for confirmation this time and enter late, and this would provide\nadditional fuel for the upward move after the price action longs got in.\nEven though bar 7 had a bear body, at least it closed above its midpoint, indicating some strength. Presumably, bulls were a little cautious after\nlosing on entries from bars 1, 3, and 5. Also, it was a failed breakout from barbwire, which often forms the final flag of a trend.

The breakout usually has strong\nvolume, a large breakout bar (a strong trend bar), and follow-through over the next several bars. Smart money is clearly entering on the breakout.\nHowever, that is rarely the best way to trade a breakout, and price action traders almost always find an earlier price action entry like a high 1 or 2 in\na bull trend. It is important to recognize that when a trend is strong, you can enter at any time and make a profit if you use an adequate stop. Once\ntraders see that a trend is strong, some traders do not take the first entries because they are hoping for a larger pullback, like a two-legged\npullback to the moving average. For example, if the market just became clearly always-in long and the initial bull spike has three good-sized bull\ntrend bars with small tails, a trader might be afraid that the move was a little climactic and decide that he wants to wait for a high 2 buy setup.\nHowever, when a trend is very strong like this, the first couple of entries are usually just high 1 buy setups. Aggressive traders will place limit orders\nto buy below the low of the prior bar, expecting any reversal attempt to fail. Once the market trades below the low of the prior bar, they will expect a\nhigh 1 buy setup to lead to at least a new high and probably a measured move up, based on the height of the bull spike. If traders fail to take either\nof these two early entries, they should train themselves to guarantee that they get into this strong trend. When they are looking at the pullback\nbeginning, they should put a buy stop at one tick above the high of the spike, in case the pullback is only one bar and reverses up quickly. If they fail\nto take either of the early pullback entries and the market begins to race up without them, they will be swept into the trade and not be left behind. On\nthe strongest trades, you will usually see that the bar that breaks above the bull spike is usually a large bull trend bar, and this tells you that many\nstrong bulls believe that there is value buying the new high. If it is a great entry for so many of them, it is a great entry for you as well.\nOne quick way to determine the strength of a trend is to see how it reacts after it breaks beyond prior trend extremes. For example, if a bull trend\nhas a pullback and then breaks above the high of the day, does it find more buyers or sellers on the breakout? If the market moves far enough up\nfor the breakout buyers to make at least a scalper's profit, then the breakout found more buyers than sellers. That is one of the hallmarks of a strong\ntrend. By contrast, if the market raced to a new swing high but then reversed down within a bar or two, then the breakout found more sellers than\nbuyers, which is more characteristic of trading ranges, and the market could be transitioning into a trading range. Watching how the market\nbehaves at a new high gives a clue as to whether there is a still strong trend in effect. If not, even though the trend may still be in effect, it is less\nstrong and longs should be taking profits at the new extreme and even looking to go short, instead of buying the breakout to the new high or looking\nto buy a small pullback. The opposite is true in bear trends.\nIn general, if you are entering on a stop at a new extreme, you should scalp most or all of your trade unless the trend is especially strong. If so, you\ncan swing most or all of your position. For example, if the market is in a strong bull trend, bulls will buy above the most recent high on a stop but\nmost will scalp out of their trade. If the market is extremely strong, they might swing most of their position. If not, bears will be shorting on every new\nswing high with a limit order at the old swing high or slightly above, and they will add on higher. If the market drops after their first entry, they will exit\nwith a profit. If instead the market continued up, they expect the old high to be tested by a pullback within a few bars, and this would allow them to\nexit their first entry at breakeven and to exit their higher entry with a profit.\nFigure 4.1 Strong Breakouts Have Many Consecutive Strong Trend Bars\nAs shown in Figure 4.1, the rally from the bar 4 higher low became a strong bull trend (higher low after a trend line break), with seven bull trend bars\nin a row as the market reversed through the bar 1 high of the day.

Bar 6 was a large bull trend bar with no tails, which\nindicated that many strong bulls bought on that same bar. Once traders saw that the strong bulls bought the breakout to the new high, they should\nhave been reassured that the trade was good. Their initial protective stop was below the most recent minor swing low, which was the high 1 signal\nbar before bar 6.\nPullback traders would have entered earlier in every instance, on the breakout pullbacks, which were bull flags—for example, at the bar 6 high 1,\nthe bar 8 high 2, the bar 10 failed wedge reversal, the bar 12 high 2 and failed trend line break (not shown), and the bar 15 high 2 test below the\nmoving average (first moving average gap bar buy setup) and double bottom with bar 12 (the high 2 was based on the two clear, larger legs down\nfrom bar 14). Breakout traders are initiating their longs in the exact area where price action traders are selling their longs for a profit. In general, it is\nnot wise to be buying where a lot of smart traders are selling. However, when the market is strong, you can buy anywhere, including above the high,\nand still make a profit. However, the risk/reward ratio is much better when you buy pullbacks than it is when you buy breakouts.\nBlindly buying breakouts is foolish, and smart money would not have bought the bar 11 breakout because it was a possible third push up after the\nexceptionally strong bar 6 breakout bar reset the count and formed the first push up. Also, they would not have bought the bar 16 breakout, which\nwas a higher high test of the old bar 14 high after a trend line break, since there was too much risk of a trend reversal. It is far better to fade\nbreakouts when they fail or enter in the direction of the breakout after it pulls back. When traders think that a breakout looks too weak to buy, they\nwill often instead short at and above the prior high.\nBears can make money on breakouts above prior swing highs by shorting the breakout and adding on higher. Then, when the market comes\nback to test the breakout, they can exit their entire short position and make a profit on their second entry and get out around breakeven on their first\nshort. This strategy would have been possible if a bear shorted as the market moved above bars 5, 7, 9, and 14. For example, as the market pulled\nback from the bar 7 swing high, bears could place orders to go short at or slightly above that high. Their shorts would be filled during bar 8. They\nwould then add to their short positions when they thought that the market might begin to pull back again or at a couple of points higher. They would\nthen try to exit all their short trades on a limit order at the original entry price, at the bar 7 high. Because bears are buying back their shorts on that\nbreakout test and because bulls are adding to their longs in that same area, the pullback often ends at that price and the market once again goes\nup.\nThe reversal up at bar 4 was a breakout of the final flag of the bear trend. Sometimes final flag reversals come from higher lows and not lower\nlows. The test of the old extreme can exceed the old extreme or fall short. Bar 15 was the end of the final flag in the bull trend, and the reversal at bar\n16 was from a new extreme (a higher high).\nFigure 4.2 A Strong Trend Usually Has Follow-Through on the Next Day\nAs shown in Figure 4.2, yesterday (only the final hour is visible) was a strong trend from the open bull trend day, so the odds were high that there\nwould be enough follow-through today to close above the open, and even if there was a pullback on the open today, the bull trend would likely reach\nat least a nominal new high. Traders were all watching for a buy setup.\nBar 2 was a small higher low after a high 4 buy setup, and a double bottom with the final pullback of yesterday. The signal bar had a bear close\nbut at least its close was above its midpoint. Traders who missed that entry saw the market form a strong bull spike over the next two and three\nbars and decided that the market was now always-in long. Smart traders bought at least a small position at the market, just in case there was no\npullback until after the market went much higher.\nThere were two large bull trend bars on the breakout, each with strong closes and small tails. Had you gone long at the close of bar 3, you would\nbe swinging a portion of your trade at this point. This means that if you were instead flat, you could buy that same position size at the market and\nuse the stop that you would have used had you bought earlier. That stop would now be below the bar 3 strong bull trend bar.\nBar 4 was a pause bar just below yesterday's high, and buying one tick above its high is another good entry. A pause bar is a possible reversal\nsetup, so buying above its high will be going long where the early bears are buying back their shorts and where the longs who exited early would\nalso be buying back their longs.\nAt this point, the trend was clear and strong and you should be buying every pullback.\nBar 6 was followed by a two-bar reversal and a third push up and was an acceptable short setup for a pullback to the moving average.\nBar 8 was a reasonable countertrend scalp (a failed breakout to a new high after a trend line break) since it was a strong bear reversal bar and\nan expanding triangle top, but the trend was still up. Note that there had not yet been a close below the moving average and the market had been\nabove the moving average for more than 20 bars, both of which are signs of strength. If you were thinking about taking a countertrend scalp, you\nwould do so only if you would immediately look to get long again as the trend reversed back up. You do not want to exit a long, take a short scalp,\nand then miss out on a swing up as the trend resumes. If you cannot process the two changes of direction reliably, do not take the countertrend\ntrade; simply hold long.\nBar 9 was a bull inside bar after the first close below the moving average and the second bar of a two-bar reversal, so a breakout above the\nsetup was expected to test the bull high at a minimum.\n", "text_clean": "that was likely to continue for at least a measured move up based on the height of the bull spike.

For example, as the market pulled back from the bar 7 swing high, bears could place orders to go short at or slightly above that high. Their shorts would be filled during bar 8. They would then add to their short positions when they thought that the market might begin to pull back again or at a couple of points higher. They would then try to exit all their short trades on a limit order at the original entry price, at the bar 7 high. Because bears are buying back their shorts on that breakout test and because bulls are adding to their longs in that same area, the pullback often ends at that price and the market once again goes up.\nThe reversal up at bar 4 was a breakout of the final flag of the bear trend. Sometimes final flag reversals come from higher lows and not lower lows. The test of the old extreme can exceed the old extreme or fall short. Bar 15 was the end of the final flag in the bull trend, and the reversal at bar 16 was from a new extreme (a higher high).\nFigure 4.2 A Strong Trend Usually Has Follow-Through on the Next Day As shown in Figure 4.2, yesterday (only the final hour is visible) was a strong trend from the open bull trend day, so the odds were high that there would be enough follow-through today to close above the open, and even if there was a pullback on the open today, the bull trend would likely reach at least a nominal new high.

On a larger scale, it is the basis for a\nmajor trend reversal, which is discussed in book 3, where there is a trend line break and then a breakout pullback that tests the trend's extreme.\nThe sequence occurs with all breakouts, but most often with a breakout of a bull or bear flag, which is a small trend in the opposite direction of the\nmain trend on the screen.\nWhenever there is a breakout, the market eventually pulls back and tests previous significant prices. The start of the pullback converts the\nbreakout into a failure, and you should look at all breakouts as failing at this point, even if they subsequently resume. If the failure succeeds in\nreversing the trend, the breakout will have failed and the reversal will have succeeded. If the reversal only goes for a bar or two and the breakout\nresumes, the reversal attempt will simply become a pullback from the breakout (all failed breakouts that fail to reverse the market are breakout\npullback setups for trades in the direction of the breakout). For example, if there is a bull breakout and then the market pulls back to around the\nentry price, forms a buy signal bar, and triggers the long, this pullback tested the breakout (it is a breakout test), and set up a long above the high of\nthe most recent pullback bar. If the trend resumes, the breakout bar usually becomes a measuring gap, and if the trend reverses, the bull trend bar\nbecomes an exhaustion gap, and the bear trend bar becomes a breakout gap (gaps are discussed in Chapter 6). Tests can be on the bar after the\nbreakout or 20 or more bars later. What exactly got tested? The test is whether the breakout will succeed or fail. The market pulls back from the\nbreakout because of selling. The bulls are selling to take partial profits on their longs, and the bears are selling in an attempt to make the breakout\nfail and flip the direction of the always-in trade to down. Both the bulls and the bears assess the strength of the breakout. If the setup and the entry\nbar are strong, traders will expect higher prices. When the market pulls back to the area of the breakout, bulls who are already long, whether or not\nthey scalped out of some of their position on the breakout, will use the pullback as an opportunity to buy again. Bulls who missed the original entry\nwill also use this pullback to get long. Bears who shorted prior to the breakout, below the entry price, will believe that the market has flipped to\nalways-in long and it will trend higher. They will therefore use the pullback to buy back their shorts with a small loss. The bears who shorted the\nbreakout will see that the breakout was strong and that the attempt to make the breakout fail was weak, and they will buy back their shorts with\neither a small profit or loss, or at breakeven. Since the bears now believe the breakout will be successful and that the market will rally, they will not\nwant to short again until the market is higher, and only if a sell signal develops.\nIf the setup or the breakout was weak, and if a strong bear reversal bar developed shortly after the breakout, traders will expect the breakout to\nfail and for the bear trend to begin or resume. The bulls will sell out of their longs and not look to buy again for at least several bars, and the bears\nwill initiate new shorts or add to their current shorts. The result will be that the market will fall below the bull breakout entry price, the test of that level\nwill have failed, and the bear trend will have at least one more leg sideways to down.\nIf the breakout and the reversal are about equally strong, traders will then look at the bar after the bear reversal signal bar. If it has a strong bear\nclose and is a strong bear trend bar, the chances that the reversal will continue down increase. If instead it is a strong bull reversal bar, chances are\nthe failed breakout will not succeed, and this bull reversal bar then becomes a signal bar for a breakout pullback buy at one tick above its high.\nRemember, the single most important determination that a trader makes, and he makes this after the close of every bar, is whether there will be\nmore buyers or sellers above and below the prior bar. This is particularly true with breakouts and failed breakouts, because the move that follows\nusually determines the always-in direction and therefore lasts for many bars, and is not just a scalp.\nThis same process is repeated many times every day on all time frames. The breakout might simply be a quiet push above the high of the prior\nbar, and the pullback can begin on the next bar; when that is the case, the breakout might be a 10-bar breakout on a smaller time frame chart. The\nbreakout can also be huge, like a 10-bar bull spike, and the pullback can occur 20 or more bars later. When the process involves many bars, it is a\nsmall breakout on a higher time frame chart, with the breakout and pullback on that chart simply lasting a few bars.\nFollowing a bull breakout, these are some of the common areas that often get by the pullback:\nThe breakout point (the price where the breakout began).\nThe top of a spike in a spike and channel bull trend. Once the market breaks below the channel, it usually tests down to the top of the\nspike, and eventually to the bottom of the channel.\nThe top of the spike in a final flag breakout. Once the market begins to pull back after breaking out of a potential final flag, it usually tests\nthe swing high that preceded the flag.\nThe most recent swing high in a stairs pattern. Bull stairs usually have pullbacks that fall at least a little below the most recent swing high.\nThe top of the lower trading range in a bull trending trading range day. If it does not reverse back up, it can retrace to the bottom of that\nlower trading range.\nAfter the market rallies to the third push up in a potential wedge (a rising convergent channel), the odds are very high that it will test the\ntop of the second push up. Once it reverses, it usually tests to the bottom of the wedge (the bottom of the first pullback, which is the\nbottom of the wedge channel).\nThe high of the signal bar. Even if the breakout bar breaks out above a swing high from 10 bars earlier, there will often be a test of the\nhigh of the bar just before the breakout bar.\nThe low of the entry bar. If the market falls below the entry bar, it often does so in a strong bear trend bar, and the move down from there\nis usually big enough for at least a scalp.\nThe bottom of the swing low at the start of the leg up. The market sometimes falls below the entry bar and signal bar and retraces to the\nbottom of the bull leg, where it often will form a double bottom bull flag.\nAny support area like the moving average, a prior swing low, a trend line, or a trend channel line (like if the market forms a wedge bull\nflag).\nWhenever there is a breakout, traders have to decide whether it will be followed by a trend or it will fail and reverse.

The countertrend traders will see the pullback as a sign that the breakout has failed, and they will enter on the assumption that the market\nwill reverse, at least enough for a scalp. The with-trend traders will be taking some profits, but they expect that the failed breakout won't go far\nbefore it sets up a breakout pullback and then the trend will resume. For example, if there is a bull breakout, the first bar with a low below the low of\nthe prior bar is a pullback. However, traders need to decide if instead it is a failed breakout and about to lead to a reversal back down. The more\nthat the breakout has characteristics of a strong trend, the more likely it will have follow-through. If it has few or none of those characteristics, the\nodds of it failing and reversing back down increase. Characteristics of strong trends are detailed in the first book, Trading Price Action Trends, but\nimportant features of a strong bull trend are several consecutive bull trend bars with very little overlap of the bodies, small tails, and bull strength\nearlier in the day. If, however, the second bar is a relatively strong bear reversal or a bear inside bar, the breakout bar is not too large, the breakout\nis the third push up, and that bar reverses back below the trend channel line, the odds of a failed breakout and a tradable short are better. If you\nshort below the low of that bar and the next bar is a strong bull reversal bar, you usually should reverse back to long because that failed breakout\nmight be failing and instead setting up a breakout pullback buy setup.\nAfter a breakout, eventually there will be a pullback to test the strength of the traders who initiated the breakout, and the success of the test will be\ndetermined by whether the traders enter in this area for a second time. The strongest breakouts usually do not come all the way back to the\nbreakout point, but some pullbacks can retrace well beyond the breakout point and still be followed by a strong trend. For example, in a bull stair\npattern, each breakout to a new swing high is followed by a deep breakout pullback. That breakout pullback stays above the prior higher low,\ncreating a bull trend of higher highs and lows, and then is followed by another higher high. If the breakout pullback comes back to within a few ticks\nof the entry price, it is a breakout test. The test can occur on the bar after the breakout or even 20 or more bars later, or both. This test bar is a\npotential signal bar, and smart traders look to place a buy stop entry order at one tick above it in case the test is successful and the trend resumes.\nIt is a particularly reliable breakout pullback setup.\nIn an upside breakout, there was probably heavy buying in the area of the breakout price and the buyers overwhelmed the sellers. On the\nbreakout pullback, the market is coming back down to that price area to see if the buyers will once again overwhelm the sellers. If they do, the result\nwill likely be at least two legs up, with the breakout being the first leg up. If, however, the sellers overpower the buyers, then the breakout failed and\nthere will likely be a tradable move down since the remaining longs will be trapped and new longs will be hesitant to buy again after the failure. The\nbuyers will have made two attempts to go up from this price area and failed, so the market will now likely do the opposite and have at least two legs\ndown.\nIf there is a pullback within a bar or two of the breakout, the breakout has failed. However, even the strongest breakouts will have a one- or two-\nbar failure that in fact becomes just a breakout pullback instead of a reversal. Once the trend resumes, the failed breakout will have failed, which is\nthe case in all breakout pullbacks. A breakout pullback is simply a failed attempt to reverse the breakout. Consecutive failures are second entries\nand therefore have an excellent chance of setting up a profitable trade. A breakout pullback is also referred to as a cup and handle, and it is one of\nthe most reliable with-trend setups.\nBreakout pullbacks can happen in the absence of an actual breakout. If the market strongly runs close to the old extreme but does not exceed it,\nand then quietly pulls back for one to four bars or so, this will likely function exactly like a breakout pullback and it should be traded as if the pullback\nfollowed an actual breakout. Remember that when something is close to a textbook pattern, it will usually behave like a textbook pattern.\nIf there was a strong move or a first leg of a trend earlier in the day, then a with-trend breakout later in the day is more likely to be successful; a\nfailure will likely not succeed in reversing the trend, and it will become a breakout pullback. However, if most of the day has been trendless with one-\nor two-bar breakouts in both directions, the odds of a failure leading to a reversal are increased.\nAfter an initial run, many traders will take partial profits and then place a breakeven stop on the balance. The breakeven stop is not necessarily\nexactly at the entry price on every trade. Depending on the stock, a trader might be willing to risk 10 or even 30 or more cents and it is still basically\nconsidered a breakeven stop, even though the trader will be losing money. For example, if Google (GOOG) is trading at $750 and a trader just took\npartial profits on half and wants to protect the rest, but GOOG has recently been running breakeven stops by 10 to 20 cents but rarely by 30 cents,\nthe trader might place a breakeven stop at 30 cents beyond the breakout, even though it would result in at least a 30 cent loss and not an exactly\nbreakeven trade.\nIn the past year or so, Apple (AAPL) and Research in Motion (RIMM) have been very respectful of exact breakeven stops, and most breakout\npullback tests in fact end about 5 cents shy of the entry price. Goldman Sachs (GS), in contrast, routinely runs the stops before the pullback ends,\nso traders would have to be willing to risk a little if they are trying to hold on to their positions. Alternatively, they could exit at breakeven and then\nreenter on a stop at one tick beyond the test bar, but they will invariably be getting back in at 60 or more cents worse than their initial entry. If the\nprice action is still good, it makes more sense to hold through the breakout test and risk maybe 10 cents rather than getting out and then back in at\n60 cents worse.\nMost major trend reversals can be thought of as breakout pullback trades. For example, if the market has been in a bear trend and then there is a\nrally above the bear trend line, the pullback to a lower low or higher low is a breakout pullback buy setup. It is important to realize that the pullback\nfrom the breakout can exceed the old extreme, so in a bull reversal, after the breakout to the upside, the pullback can fall below the bear low and the\nbull reversal can still be valid and controlling the price action.\nSometimes the final pullback of a trend can also function as the first leg of a new trend in the opposite direction. For example, if there is a bear\ntrend, followed by a slow rally that may last 10 to 20 bars or more and then a sell climax and a reversal up into a bull trend, the channel that\ncontained the final bear flag, if projected up and to the right, will sometimes also approximately contain the new bull trend. That final bear flag can in\nfact in hindsight be viewed as actually the first move up in the new bull trend. The plunge down can be thought of as a lower low pullback in the new\nbull trend. If you recognize this pattern, you should look to swing more of your position and not be too quick to exit. Once the new bull trend\nsurpasses the bear flag high, it will hit the protective stops of the shorts who saw the bear flag as a weak attempt to rally and therefore likely not the\nfinal lower high of the bear trend. After the market reverses above that high, the bears will not look for new shorting opportunities for a while. This\noften leads to little or no pullback after the bear flag is surpassed, and the move up can be protracted. This same phenomenon is common as a\nwedge flag is forming. For example, a wedge bear flag has three pushes up. It will often have a breakout down to a lower low after the first push up.\nIt will then have two more pushes up after that low to complete the wedge bear flag. Once the bear flag is complete, the market then usually will\nbreak out of the downside of the wedge bear flag and form a new trend low.\nBreakouts often fail, and the failure can happen at any point, even after just the first bar. A one-bar breakout of a tight trading range is as likely to\nfail and reverse back into the range as it is to continue into a trend. Sharp breakouts on the open that last for a few bars often fail and lead to a\ntrend day in the opposite direction. This is discussed in book 3 in the chapter on the first hour of trading.\nOn daily charts, there are often sharp countertrend breakouts due to surprising news events. However, instead of the spike having follow-through\n(like a channel) and becoming a successful breakout, the breakout usually fails and the spike becomes just part of a brief pullback. For example, if\n", "text_clean": "pullback. The countertrend traders will see the pullback as a sign that the breakout has failed, and they will enter on the assumption that the market will reverse, at least enough for a scalp. The with-trend traders will be taking some profits, but they expect that the failed breakout won't go far before it sets up a breakout pullback and then the trend will resume. For example, if there is a bull breakout, the first bar with a low below the low of the prior bar is a pullback. However, traders need to decide if instead it is a failed breakout and about to lead to a reversal back down. The more that the breakout has characteristics of a strong trend, the more likely it will have follow-through. If it has few or none of those characteristics, the odds of it failing and reversing back down increase. Characteristics of strong trends are detailed in the first book, Trading Price Action Trends, but important features of a strong bull trend are several consecutive bull trend bars with very little overlap of the bodies, small tails, and bull strength earlier in the day. If, however, the second bar is a relatively strong bear reversal or a bear inside bar, the breakout bar is not too large, the breakout is the third push up, and that bar reverses back below the trend channel line, the odds of a failed breakout and a tradable short are better. If you short below the low of that bar and the next bar is a strong bull reversal bar, you usually should reverse back to long because that failed breakout might be failing and instead setting up a breakout pullback buy setup.\nAfter a breakout, eventually there will be a pullback to test the strength of the traders who initiated the breakout, and the success of the test will be determined by whether the traders enter in this area for a second time. The strongest breakouts usually do not come all the way back to the breakout point, but some pullbacks can retrace well beyond the breakout point and still be followed by a strong trend. For example, in a bull stair pattern, each breakout to a new swing high is followed by a deep breakout pullback. That breakout pullback stays above the prior higher low, creating a bull trend of higher highs and lows, and then is followed by another higher high. If the breakout pullback comes back to within a few ticks of the entry price, it is a breakout test. The test can occur on the bar after the breakout or even 20 or more bars later, or both. This test bar is a potential signal bar, and smart traders look to place a buy stop entry order at one tick above it in case the test is successful and the trend resumes.\nIt is a particularly reliable breakout pullback setup.\nIn an upside breakout, there was probably heavy buying in the area of the breakout price and the buyers overwhelmed the sellers. On the breakout pullback, the market is coming back down to that price area to see if the buyers will once again overwhelm the sellers. If they do, the result will likely be at least two legs up, with the breakout being the first leg up. If, however, the sellers overpower the buyers, then the breakout failed and there will likely be a tradable move down since the remaining longs will be trapped and new longs will be hesitant to buy again after the failure. The buyers will have made two attempts to go up from this price area and failed, so the market will now likely do the opposite and have at least two legs down.\nIf there is a pullback within a bar or two of the breakout, the breakout has failed. However, even the strongest breakouts will have a one- or twobar failure that in fact becomes just a breakout pullback instead of a reversal. Once the trend resumes, the failed breakout will have failed, which is the case in all breakout pullbacks. A breakout pullback is simply a failed attempt to reverse the breakout. Consecutive failures are second entries and therefore have an excellent chance of setting up a profitable trade. A breakout pullback is also referred to as a cup and handle, and it is one of the most reliable with-trend setups.\nBreakout pullbacks can happen in the absence of an actual breakout. If the market strongly runs close to the old extreme but does not exceed it, and then quietly pulls back for one to four bars or so, this will likely function exactly like a breakout pullback and it should be traded as if the pullback followed an actual breakout. Remember that when something is close to a textbook pattern, it will usually behave like a textbook pattern.\nIf there was a strong move or a first leg of a trend earlier in the day, then a with-trend breakout later in the day is more likely to be successful; a failure will likely not succeed in reversing the trend, and it will become a breakout pullback. However, if most of the day has been trendless with oneor two-bar breakouts in both directions, the odds of a failure leading to a reversal are increased.\nAfter an initial run, many traders will take partial profits and then place a breakeven stop on the balance. The breakeven stop is not necessarily exactly at the entry price on every trade. Depending on the stock, a trader might be willing to risk 10 or even 30 or more cents and it is still basically considered a breakeven stop, even though the trader will be losing money. For example, if Google (GOOG) is trading at $750 and a trader just took partial profits on half and wants to protect the rest, but GOOG has recently been running breakeven stops by 10 to 20 cents but rarely by 30 cents, the trader might place a breakeven stop at 30 cents beyond the breakout, even though it would result in at least a 30 cent loss and not an exactly breakeven trade.\nIn the past year or so, Apple (AAPL) and Research in Motion (RIMM) have been very respectful of exact breakeven stops, and most breakout pullback tests in fact end about 5 cents shy of the entry price. Goldman Sachs (GS), in contrast, routinely runs the stops before the pullback ends, so traders would have to be willing to risk a little if they are trying to hold on to their positions. Alternatively, they could exit at breakeven and then reenter on a stop at one tick beyond the test bar, but they will invariably be getting back in at 60 or more cents worse than their initial entry. If the price action is still good, it makes more sense to hold through the breakout test and risk maybe 10 cents rather than getting out and then back in at 60 cents worse.\nMost major trend reversals can be thought of as breakout pullback trades. For example, if the market has been in a bear trend and then there is a rally above the bear trend line, the pullback to a lower low or higher low is a breakout pullback buy setup. It is important to realize that the pullback from the breakout can exceed the old extreme, so in a bull reversal, after the breakout to the upside, the pullback can fall below the bear low and the bull reversal can still be valid and controlling the price action.\nSometimes the final pullback of a trend can also function as the first leg of a new trend in the opposite direction. For example, if there is a bear trend, followed by a slow rally that may last 10 to 20 bars or more and then a sell climax and a reversal up into a bull trend, the channel that contained the final bear flag, if projected up and to the right, will sometimes also approximately contain the new bull trend. That final bear flag can in fact in hindsight be viewed as actually the first move up in the new bull trend. The plunge down can be thought of as a lower low pullback in the new bull trend. If you recognize this pattern, you should look to swing more of your position and not be too quick to exit. Once the new bull trend surpasses the bear flag high, it will hit the protective stops of the shorts who saw the bear flag as a weak attempt to rally and therefore likely not the final lower high of the bear trend. After the market reverses above that high, the bears will not look for new shorting opportunities for a while. This often leads to little or no pullback after the bear flag is surpassed, and the move up can be protracted. This same phenomenon is common as a wedge flag is forming. For example, a wedge bear flag has three pushes up. It will often have a breakout down to a lower low after the first push up.\nIt will then have two more pushes up after that low to complete the wedge bear flag. Once the bear flag is complete, the market then usually will break out of the downside of the wedge bear flag and form a new trend low.\nBreakouts often fail, and the failure can happen at any point, even after just the first bar. A one-bar breakout of a tight trading range is as likely to fail and reverse back into the range as it is to continue into a trend. Sharp breakouts on the open that last for a few bars often fail and lead to a trend day in the opposite direction. This is discussed in book 3 in the chapter on the first hour of trading.\nOn daily charts, there are often sharp countertrend breakouts due to surprising news events. However, instead of the spike having follow-through (like a channel) and becoming a successful breakout, the breakout usually fails and the spike becomes just part of a brief pullback.

All climaxes end with a trading range, which can be as brief as a single bar. During the trading range, the bulls and bears continue\nto trade, and both try to get follow-through in their direction. In Figure 5.1, in both the sell climax down to bar 5 and the buy climax up to bar 19, the\nbulls won the struggles.\nBars 1, 2, 3, and 5 ended bear spikes, and consecutive sell climaxes often lead to a correction that lasts at least 10 bars and has at least two\nlegs. Bar 4 was the largest bear trend bar of the bear trend and it could therefore represent the last weak longs finally giving up and exiting at any\nprice. This was probably the case, and the market corrected up in two legs into the close, with the first leg ending at bar 8 and the second leg\nending with the last bar of the day.\nThe next day, bars 15, 16, 17, and 19 were buy climaxes. The market successfully broke out of the downside of the bull channel that followed the\ngap spike up to bar 15 and ended with the three pushes up to bar 17. However, whenever a correction is sideways instead of down, the bulls are\nstrong, and they were able to create a breakout above the three-push top. Although the large bull bar could have been caused by the last bears\nfinally giving up, in this case it was created by aggressive bulls successfully breaking the market above the wedge top. This bull spike was followed\nby a channel that tried to end at bar 21 but was able to extend up to bar 25.\nFigure 5.2 Breakout Pullbacks\nAs shown in Figure 5.2, bar 8 was a potential failed breakout but the breakout was strong, made up of three bear trend bars that covered most of\nthe day's range and had small tails and little overlap. The market pulled back to the moving average and led to a low 2 short (or a small wedge bear\nflag) signal at bar 10, which was the second bear trend bar and the end of the second leg of the pullback to the moving average. A breakout\npullback is one of the most reliable setups.\nBar 12 again was a potential failed breakout to a new low of the day. This is a reversal up from a second consecutive sell climax, and reversals\nfrom consecutive climaxes usually lead to pullbacks that have at least 10 bars and two legs. Even though the bar 12 signal bar was a doji and not a\nbull reversal bar, it had a bigger bull tail than bear tail, indicating some buying and some weakening of the bears. Also, the bar 8 to bar 10 bear flag\nwas a tight trading range and therefore had a magnetic pull, increasing the chances that any breakout would get pulled back up to that level. Bar 11\nwas a breakout bar and therefore it created a breakout gap. Breakout gaps usually get tested, as do breakout points. The bar 1 low was the\nbreakout point. The bears wanted the pullback to stay below bar 1, and the bulls wanted the opposite. At a minimum, the bulls wanted the market to\nget back above the bar 1 low and stay there so that most traders would see the breakout as a failure. This would have probably ended the bear\ntrend.

Therefore, bulls should be expected\nto come in around the bar 12 price level, which was a measured move down from the first leg down on the day (bar 2 to bar 4).\nBar 31 is a pullback from a small rally that broke above a minor swing high and almost broke to a new high of the day.

On daily, weekly, and monthly charts, traditional gaps are easy to spot. For example, if the market is in\na bull trend and today's low is above the high of yesterday, then today gapped up. These traditional gaps are called breakaway or breakout gaps\nwhen they form at the start of a trend, measuring gaps when they are in the middle of a trend, and exhaustion gaps when they form at the end of a\ntrend. When a gap forms at other times, like within the spike phase of a trend or within a trading range, it is simply called a gap. Traders usually\ncannot classify a gap until after they see what the market does next. For example, if the market is breaking out of the top of a trading range on the\ndaily chart and the breakout bar is a large bull trend bar with a low above the high of the prior bar, traders will see the gap as a sign of strength and\nwill think of it as a potential breakaway gap. If the new bull trend continues for dozens of bars, they will look back at the gap and definitively call it a\nbreakaway gap. If instead the market reverses down into a bear trend within a few bars, they will call it an exhaustion gap.\nIf the bull trend goes for five or 10 bars or so and gaps again, traders will think that this second gap might become the middle of the bull trend.\nThey will see it as a possible measuring gap, and many traders will look to take profits on their longs once the market makes a measured move up.\nThe measured move is based on the height from the bottom of the bull trend to the middle of the gap, and this height is added to the middle of the\ngap. This type of gap usually is in the spike phase of a trend, and it gives traders confidence to enter at the market or on small pullbacks because\nthey believe that the market will work its way toward a measured move target.\nAfter the bull trend has gone on for dozens of bars, reaches a resistance area, and is beginning to show signs of a possible reversal, traders will\npay attention to the next gap up, if there is one. If one forms, they will see it as a potential exhaustion gap. If, before going much higher, the market\ntrades back down to below the high of the bar before the gap, traders will see that as a sign of weakness and will think that the gap might represent\nexhaustion, which is a type of buy climax. They will often not look to buy again until after the market has corrected for at least 10 bars and two legs.\nSometimes an exhaustion gap forms before a trend reversal, and because of that, whenever there is a possible exhaustion gap, traders will look at\nthe overall price action to see if the trader's equation warrants a short position. If there is a reversal, the trend bar that creates it is then a breakout\ngap (a bar can function like a gap) and a possible start of a trend in the opposite direction.\nBecause all trend bars are gaps, traders can see intraday equivalents of the traditional gaps that are so common on daily charts. If there is a bull\ntrend that is at a resistance area and is likely to reverse down (reversals are discussed in book 3), but has one final breakout, that bull trend bar\nmight become an exhaustion gap. The bar is sometimes a very large bull trend bar that closes near its high, and occasionally the final breakout will\nbe made of two very large bull trend bars. This is a potential buy climax, and it alerts astute traders to sell. The bulls sell to grab profits, since they\nbelieve that the market will likely trade down for a couple of legs and about 10 bars, possibly allowing them to buy again much lower. They also are\naware of the possibility of an exhaustive buy climax and trend reversal, and do not want to risk giving back any of their profits. Aggressive bears are\naware of this as well, and they will sell to initiate shorts. If a strong bear trend bar forms within the next few bars and the always-in direction flips to\ndown, that final bull trend bar becomes a confirmed exhaustion gap, and the bear trend bar becomes a breakout gap. The bull trend bar followed by\nthe bear trend bar is a climactic reversal, and a two-bar reversal. If there are one or more bars between the two trend bars, those bars form an\nisland top. The bottom of that island top is the top of the bear breakout gap and, like all gaps, might get tested. If it does and the market turns down\nagain, that breakout test forms a lower high. If the initial reversal down was strong, both bulls and bears will sell as the market tests the island top\nand as the market turns down again, since both are more confident that the market will fall for about 10 or more bars. The bulls will sell to lock in\nprofits or to minimize losses, if they bought higher as the bull trend breakout bars were forming. The bears will sell to initiate shorts. Once the\nmarket trades down for many bars, profit takers (bears buying back their shorts) will come in and create a pullback or a trading range. If the market\nagain has a bear trend bar that breaks below the trading range, that bar is then a possible measuring gap, and traders will try to hold onto part of\ntheir shorts until the market approaches that target.\nAs the market turns down, traders will look at the strength of the bear bars. If there are one or two large bear trend bars closing near their lows,\ntraders will assume that the always-in direction might be flipping to short. They will watch the next few bars to see if a high 1 buy signal bar\ndevelops. If one forms and it is weak (relative to the selloff), like a small bull doji or a bear bar, more traders will look to short above its high than to\nbuy. Remember, this is a high 1 pullback in what has been a bull trend, but now traders are looking for about 10 bars sideways to down, so more\nwill look to short above the high 1 buy signal bar than to buy. If they are right, the high 1 buy signal will fail and form a lower high. If the reversal down\nis strong, traders will also short below the lower high and below the high 1 buy signal bar. If the market goes more sideways to down and then forms\na high 2 buy setup, the bears will assume that it, too, will fail, and will place limit orders at and above its high to go short. Other bears will place stop\norders to go short below the high 2 buy signal bar, because that is where the bulls who bought the high 2 will have their protective stops. Once these\nbulls get stopped out, they will likely not look to buy again for at least a couple of bars, and the absence of bulls and the presence of bears can lead\nto a bear breakout. If it is weak, the bulls might be able to create a wedge bull flag (a high 3 buy setup). If the breakout is strong, the move down will\nlikely go for at least a couple of small legs, and reach a measured move, based on the height of the trading range (the bull high to the bottom of the\nhigh 2 bull signal bar). The breakout bar then becomes a measuring gap. If the bulls are successful in turning the market up at the high 3 (a wedge\nbull flag), then the bear measuring gap will close and become an exhaustion gap.\nThis process happens many times a day on every chart, and traders are always asking themselves whether a breakout will likely succeed (and\nturn the breakout bar into a measuring gap), or will it more likely fail (and turn the trend bar that formed the breakout into an exhaustion gap). The\nlabels are not important, but the implications are. This is the single most important decision that traders make, and they make it whenever they\nconsider any trade: Will there be more buyers or sellers above and below the prior bar?

In the case of that bull breakout, when there finally is a signal bar for a failed breakout, traders will decide if there will be more buyers\nor sellers below that bar. If they think that the breakout is strong, they will assume that there will be more buyers, and they will buy below the bar.\nOthers will wait to see if the next bar only falls for a few ticks. If so, they will place stop orders to buy above it, and they will consider it to be a\nbreakout pullback buy setup. The gap will then likely become a measuring gap. The bears will see that signal bar for the failed breakout as a strong\nsell signal, and they will short below its low.

The closer the market gets to any magnet, the stronger the magnetic field and the\nmore likely the market will reach the magnet (this is the basis for buy and sell vacuums). For example, if there is a gap up in a bull trend, once there\nis finally a correction or a reversal, the market might be only slightly more likely to go below the high of the bar before the gap (and therefore fill the\ngap) than it is to go below the high of any other bar in the rally. However, since gaps are magnets, traders can look for trading opportunities as the\nmarket approaches them, just as they should as the market approaches any magnet.\nGaps where the low of a bar is above the high of the prior bar, or where the high of a bar is below the low of the prior bar, are rare on an intraday\nchart of a highly liquid instrument, except on the first bar of the day, when they are common. However, if one uses a broad definition, gaps of other\ntypes occur many times every day on a 5 minute chart, and they can be useful in understanding what the market is doing and in setting up trades.\nOccasionally, the open of a bar on a 5 minute chart will be above the close of the prior bar, and this is often a subtle indication of strength. For\nexample, if there are two or three of these gaps on consecutive bull trend bars, the bulls are likely strong. All of these gaps have the same\nsignificance on daily, weekly, and monthly charts as well.\nBecause gaps are important elements of price action, intraday traders should use a broad definition of a gap and look at trend bars as an\nintraday equivalents because they are functionally identical. If the volume was thin enough, there would be actual gaps on every intraday chart\nwhenever there was a series of trend bars. Remember, all trend bars are spikes, breakouts, and climaxes, and a breakout is a variant of a gap.\nWhen there is a large gap up on the first bar of the day on the Emini, there will be a large bull trend bar on the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 cash\nindex. That is an example of how a gap and a trend bar represent the same behavior. When there is a large trend bar at the start of a trend, it\ncreates a breakout gap. For example, if the market is reversing up from a low or breaking out of a trading range, the high of the bar before the trend\nbar and the low of the bar after it create the breakout gap. You can simply think of the entire trend bar's body as the gap as well, and there may be\nother recent swing highs that some traders will consider as the bottom of the gap. There is often not a single choice, but that does not matter. What\ndoes matter is that there is a breakout, which means that there is a gap, even though a traditional gap is not visible on the chart. The market will\noften dip a tick or two below the high of the bar before the trend bar, and traders will still think that the breakout is in effect as long as the pullback\ndoes not fall below the low of the trend bar. In general, if the market falls more than a couple of ticks below the high of the bar before it, traders will\nlose confidence in the breakout and there might not be much follow-through, even if there is no reversal.\nWhenever there is a trend bar in a potential bull breakout, always look at the high of the bar before it and the low of the bar after it. If they do not\noverlap, the space between them might function as a measuring gap. If the trend continues up, look for profit taking at the measured move (based\non the low of the bull leg to the middle of the gap). Sometimes the bottom of the gap will be a swing high that formed several bars earlier, or a high\nwithin the spike, but a couple of bars before the trend bar. The low of the gap might be a swing low that forms many bars after the breakout bar. The\nsame is true of a bear trend bar that is breaking out in a bear leg. Always look for potential measuring gaps, the most obvious one being the one\nbetween the low of the bar before the bear trend bar and the high of the bar after it.\nIf the bull trend has been going on for 5 to 10 or more bars and then there is another bull trend bar, it might become just an unremarkable gap, a\nmeasuring gap, or an exhaustion gap. Traders will not know until they see the next several bars. If there is another strong bull trend bar, the odds of\na measuring gap are greater and bulls will continue to buy with the expectation of the rally continuing up for about a measured move, based on the\nmiddle of the gap.\nAnother common gap is between the high or low of a bar and the moving average. In trends, these can set up good swing trades that test the\nextreme of the trend, and in trading ranges, they often set up scalps to the moving average. For example, if there is a strong bear trend and the\nmarket finally rallies above the moving average, the first bar in that rally that has a low above the moving average is a first moving average gap bar.\nTraders will place a sell stop order at one tick below the low of that bar to go short, looking for a test of the bear market low. If the stop is not\ntriggered, they will keep moving the stop up to one tick below the low of the bar that just closed until their short is filled. Sometimes they will get\nstopped out by the market moving above the signal bar, and if that happens, they will try one more time to reenter their shorts at one tick below the\nlow of the prior bar. Once filled, the signal bar is a second moving average gap bar short signal.\nMoving average gaps happen many times a day every day, and most of the time they occur in the absence of a strong trend. If traders are\nselective, many of these gap bars can set up fades to the moving average. For example, assume that the day is a trading range day and that the\nmarket has been above the moving average for an hour or so. If it then sells off to below the moving average but is followed by a strong bull reversal\nbar with a high that is below the moving average, traders will often go long above that bar if there enough room between the high of that bar and the\nmoving average for a long scalp.\nBreakouts on all time frames, including intraday and daily charts, often form breakout gaps and measuring gaps that are different from the\ntraditional versions. The space between the breakout point and the first pause or pullback after the breakout is a gap, and if it appears early in a\npossible strong trend, it is a breakaway gap and is a sign of strength. Although it will lead to a measured move from the start of the leg, the target is\nusually too close for traders to take profits and they should therefore ignore the measured move projection. Instead, they should look at the gap as\nonly a sign of strength and not a tool to use to create a target for taking profits. For example, if the average daily range in the Emini has been about\n12 points and after about an hour into the day the range is only three points, the gap formed by a breakout would lead to a target that would result in\na range for the day of only six points. If a trend is just beginning, it is more likely that the range will reach about the average of 12 points and not just\nsix points, and therefore traders should not be taking profits at the measured move target.\nWhen the distance from the start of the leg to the breakout gap (breakaway gap) is about a third to a half of an average daily range, its middle\noften leads to a measured move projection where traders might take profits or even reverse their positions. For example, if the market is in a\ntrading range and then the market forms a large bull trend bar that breaks out above the trading range, the swing high at the top of the range is the\nbreakout point. If the market moves sideways or up on the next bar, the low of that bar is the first price to consider as the breakout test; the midpoint\nbetween its low and the breakout point often becomes the middle of the bull leg, and the gap is a measuring gap. If the range is about a third to a\nhalf of the recent average daily range, use the bottom of the leg as the starting point for the measured move; measure the number of ticks between\nthat low and the middle of the measuring gap, and project that same number of ticks up above that midpoint. Then look to see how the market\nbehaves if it moves up to a tick or so of the measured move. If within a few bars of the breakout the market pulls back into the gap but then rallies,\nuse that pullback low as the breakout test, and then the measuring gap is between that low and the breakout point. This is a sign of strength. Once\nthe market rallies to the measured move projection, many traders will take partial or total profits on their longs. If the move up was weak, some\ntraders might even place limit orders to short at the measured move target, although only very experienced traders should consider this.\nElliott Wave traders see most of these gaps as being formed by a small wave 4 pullback that is staying above the high of wave 1, and expect a\nwave 5 to follow. Not enough volume is being traded based on Elliott Wave Theory to make this a significant component of the price action, but\nwhenever a pullback does not fall below the breakout point, all traders see this as a sign of strength and expect a test of the trend high.

For example, if the market is reversing up from a low or breaking out of a trading range, the high of the bar before the trend bar and the low of the bar after it create the breakout gap. You can simply think of the entire trend bar's body as the gap as well, and there may be other recent swing highs that some traders will consider as the bottom of the gap. There is often not a single choice, but that does not matter. What does matter is that there is a breakout, which means that there is a gap, even though a traditional gap is not visible on the chart. The market will often dip a tick or two below the high of the bar before the trend bar, and traders will still think that the breakout is in effect as long as the pullback does not fall below the low of the trend bar. In general, if the market falls more than a couple of ticks below the high of the bar before it, traders will lose confidence in the breakout and there might not be much follow-through, even if there is no reversal.\nWhenever there is a trend bar in a potential bull breakout, always look at the high of the bar before it and the low of the bar after it. If they do not overlap, the space between them might function as a measuring gap. If the trend continues up, look for profit taking at the measured move (based on the low of the bull leg to the middle of the gap). Sometimes the bottom of the gap will be a swing high that formed several bars earlier, or a high within the spike, but a couple of bars before the trend bar. The low of the gap might be a swing low that forms many bars after the breakout bar. The same is true of a bear trend bar that is breaking out in a bear leg. Always look for potential measuring gaps, the most obvious one being the one between the low of the bar before the bear trend bar and the high of the bar after it.\nIf the bull trend has been going on for 5 to 10 or more bars and then there is another bull trend bar, it might become just an unremarkable gap, a measuring gap, or an exhaustion gap. Traders will not know until they see the next several bars. If there is another strong bull trend bar, the odds of a measuring gap are greater and bulls will continue to buy with the expectation of the rally continuing up for about a measured move, based on the middle of the gap.\nAnother common gap is between the high or low of a bar and the moving average. In trends, these can set up good swing trades that test the extreme of the trend, and in trading ranges, they often set up scalps to the moving average. For example, if there is a strong bear trend and the market finally rallies above the moving average, the first bar in that rally that has a low above the moving average is a first moving average gap bar.\nTraders will place a sell stop order at one tick below the low of that bar to go short, looking for a test of the bear market low. If the stop is not triggered, they will keep moving the stop up to one tick below the low of the bar that just closed until their short is filled. Sometimes they will get stopped out by the market moving above the signal bar, and if that happens, they will try one more time to reenter their shorts at one tick below the low of the prior bar. Once filled, the signal bar is a second moving average gap bar short signal.\nMoving average gaps happen many times a day every day, and most of the time they occur in the absence of a strong trend. If traders are selective, many of these gap bars can set up fades to the moving average. For example, assume that the day is a trading range day and that the market has been above the moving average for an hour or so. If it then sells off to below the moving average but is followed by a strong bull reversal bar with a high that is below the moving average, traders will often go long above that bar if there enough room between the high of that bar and the moving average for a long scalp.\nBreakouts on all time frames, including intraday and daily charts, often form breakout gaps and measuring gaps that are different from the traditional versions. The space between the breakout point and the first pause or pullback after the breakout is a gap, and if it appears early in a possible strong trend, it is a breakaway gap and is a sign of strength. Although it will lead to a measured move from the start of the leg, the target is usually too close for traders to take profits and they should therefore ignore the measured move projection. Instead, they should look at the gap as only a sign of strength and not a tool to use to create a target for taking profits. For example, if the average daily range in the Emini has been about 12 points and after about an hour into the day the range is only three points, the gap formed by a breakout would lead to a target that would result in a range for the day of only six points. If a trend is just beginning, it is more likely that the range will reach about the average of 12 points and not just six points, and therefore traders should not be taking profits at the measured move target.\nWhen the distance from the start of the leg to the breakout gap (breakaway gap) is about a third to a half of an average daily range, its middle often leads to a measured move projection where traders might take profits or even reverse their positions. For example, if the market is in a trading range and then the market forms a large bull trend bar that breaks out above the trading range, the swing high at the top of the range is the breakout point. If the market moves sideways or up on the next bar, the low of that bar is the first price to consider as the breakout test; the midpoint between its low and the breakout point often becomes the middle of the bull leg, and the gap is a measuring gap. If the range is about a third to a half of the recent average daily range, use the bottom of the leg as the starting point for the measured move; measure the number of ticks between that low and the middle of the measuring gap, and project that same number of ticks up above that midpoint. Then look to see how the market behaves if it moves up to a tick or so of the measured move. If within a few bars of the breakout the market pulls back into the gap but then rallies, use that pullback low as the breakout test, and then the measuring gap is between that low and the breakout point. This is a sign of strength. Once the market rallies to the measured move projection, many traders will take partial or total profits on their longs. If the move up was weak, some traders might even place limit orders to short at the measured move target, although only very experienced traders should consider this.\nElliott Wave traders see most of these gaps as being formed by a small wave 4 pullback that is staying above the high of wave 1, and expect a wave 5 to follow. Not enough volume is being traded based on Elliott Wave Theory to make this a significant component of the price action, but whenever a pullback does not fall below the breakout point, all traders see this as a sign of strength and expect a test of the trend high.

You can still use the middle between that low and the\nbreakout point even though the pullback is below the breakout. When that happens, I refer to this type of gap as a negative gap, since the\nmathematical difference is a negative number. For example, in a bull breakout, if you subtract the high of the breakout point from the low of the\nbreakout test bar, the result is a negative number. Negative measuring gaps lead to projections that are less reliable, but still can be very accurate\nand therefore are worth watching. Incidentally, stairs patterns have negative gaps after each new breakout.\nSmall measuring gaps can also form around any trend bar. These micro measuring gaps occur if the bar before and the bar after the trend bar\ndo not overlap and, like any gap, can lead to a measured move. The measured move will usually be more accurate if the trend bar was acting as a\nbreakout. For example, look at any strong bull trend bar in any bull leg where the trend bar is breaking into a strong bull leg. If the low of the bar after\nit is at or above the high of the bar before it, the space between is a gap and it can be a measuring gap. Measure from the start of the leg to the\nmiddle of the gap, and project up to see how high the market would have to go if the gap was in the middle of the leg. This is an area where longs\nmight take profits. If there are other reasons to short up there, bears will short there as well. When these micro gaps occur in the first several bars of\na trend, the market will usually extend much further than a measured move based on the gap. Don't use the gap to find an area in which to take\nprofits, because the market will likely go much further and you don't want to exit early in a great swing. However, these gaps are still important in the\nearly stages of a trend because they give trend traders more confidence in the strength of the trend.\nBreakouts occur many times every day, but most of them fail and the market reverses. However, when they succeed, they offer a potential reward\nthat can be several times as large as the risk with an acceptable probability of success. Once a trader learns how to determine if a breakout is\nlikely to be successful, these trades should be considered. There are other examples of measuring gaps in Chapter 8 on measured moves.\nUsing this broad definition of a gap allows traders to discover many trading opportunities. A very common type of gap occurs in any three\nconsecutive trending bars on any chart. For example, if these three bars are trending up and the low of bar 3 is at or above the high of bar 1, there\nis a gap and it can act as a measuring gap or a breakaway gap. The high of bar 1 is the breakout point and it is tested by the low of bar 3, which\nbecomes the breakout test. On a smaller time frame chart, you can see the swing high at the top of bar 1 and the swing low at the bottom of bar 3. It\nis easy to overlook this setup, but if you study charts you will see that these gaps often get tested within the next many bars but not filled, and\ntherefore become evidence that the buyers are strong.\nA related gap occurs after the market has been trending for many bars but now has an unusually large trend bar. For example, if the market has\nbeen going up for the past couple of hours but now suddenly forms a very large bull trend bar with a close near its high, especially if the high of this\nbar or that of one of the next couple of bars extends above a trend channel line, one or more important gaps with one or more breakout points and\nbreakout tests are created. Rarely, this bar is the start of a new, even steeper bull trend, but much more commonly it represents a buy climax in an\noverdone, exhausted bull trend and will be followed within a few bars by a sideways to down correction that could last about 10 bars or so, and may\neven become a trend reversal. Experienced traders wait for these bars, and their waiting removes sellers from the market and creates a buy\nvacuum that sucks the market up quickly. Once they see it, the bulls take profits and the bears short on the close of the bar, above the bar, on the\nclose of the next bar or two if they are weak, or on a stop below those bars. Look at the bars before and after the buy climax bar. The first gap to\nconsider is that between the low of the bar after it and the high of the bar before it. If the market continues to go up for a few bars and then pulls\nback and rallies again, the breakout test is now the low of that pullback. If the market trades down below the high of the bar before the buy climax\nbar, the gap is then closed (filled). If the market continues down into a large leg down, the gap becomes an exhaustion gap.\nAlso, look at the bars before the bull breakout for other possible breakout points. These usually are swing highs and there might be several to\nconsider. For example, there might have been a small swing high a few bars earlier but another couple of higher swing highs that formed even a\ncouple of hours earlier. If the breakout bar broke strongly above all of them, they are all possible breakout points that could lead to a measured\nmove up and you might have to consider the projections up from the midpoint of each of these gaps. If there is a confluence of resistance at one of\nthe projections, like a trend channel line, a higher time frame bear trend line, or a couple of other measured move targets based on other\ncalculations, like the height of the trading range, profit takers will come in at that level and there will also be some shorts. Some of the shorts will be\nscalping, but others will be establishing swings and will add on higher.\nThere is a widely held belief that most gaps get filled or at least the breakout point gets tested, and this is true. Whenever something is likely to\nhappen, there is a trading opportunity. When there is a bear spike and channel, the market often corrects back up to the top of the channel, which is\nthe bottom of the gap, and tries to form a double top for a test down. When there is a buy climax bar that breaks out above a significant swing high,\nthere will usually be a pullback that tests that swing high, so traders should look for short setups that could lead to the test. However, do not be too\neager, and make sure that the setup makes sense and that there is other evidence that the pullback is likely to be imminent. This might be a\nsideways bull flag that breaks out and runs for a couple bars and then has a strong reversal bar, turning that bull flag into a possible final flag. Final\nflags usually are followed by at least a two-legged correction that tests the bottom of the flag; they often drop for a measured move down from the\ntop to the bottom of the flag, and sometimes lead to a trend reversal. All of the preceding is true for bear breakouts as well.\nBesides the breakout gaps that form at the start of trends and the measuring gaps that form in the middle, exhaustion gaps form when a trend is\ntrying to reverse. When there is a gap late in a trend and then the market reverses and closes the gap, the gap becomes an exhaustion gap and,\nlike all signs of exhaustion (discussed in book 3 on reversals), it is usually followed by a trading range, but it sometimes leads to a reversal. These\nare more important to traders who are trading off of daily charts, but day traders see them all the time on gap openings that lead to opening\nreversals. Day traders think of them as just failed gap openings, but they are a type of exhaustion gap. On the daily chart, if there is an exhaustion\ngap followed by a breakout gap in the opposite direction and that gap remains open after the bar closes, this creates an island reversal pattern.\nFor example, if there is a bull trend and then there is a gap up that is followed by a gap down on the next bar or even a dozen bars later, the bars\nbetween the two gaps are considered to be the island top. Figure 18.4 (in Chapter 18) shows an example of an island bottom on a daily chart.\nWhenever there is a channel and then a trend bar that closes beyond the extreme of the prior bar, traders should watch to see if a gap forms. For\nexample, if there is a bull channel or a bear flag and the next bar closes several ticks above the high of the prior bar, this breakout bar might\nbecome a measuring gap. Watch the low of the next bar to see if it stays above the high of the prior bar. If so, the breakout bar might be a\nmeasuring gap. If the gap closes, the trend bar might be an exhaustion gap and the bull spike could lead to a reversal down.\nBreakout gaps are discussed further in the first book in Chapter 23 on trends from the open and in the third book in the chapter on gap openings.\nFigure 6.1 Many Types of Gaps on a Daily Chart\n", "text_clean": "is a breakout test.\nIf the pullback falls a little below the breakout point, this is a sign of a lack of strength.

For example,\ngap 5 on the daily chart of AAPL shown in Figure 6.1 might have been a measuring gap but ended up as an exhaustion gap. Also, when a market\nis in a strong trend, it often has a series of gaps and any can become a measuring gap. Traders need to be aware of each possibility. For\nexample, gaps 4, 21, 25, 26, 27, and 45 were potential measuring gaps. Gap 4 was a measuring gap, and the bar 6 high was almost a perfect\nmeasured move. The bar 2 bottom of the leg to the middle of the gap had about as many ticks as the middle of the gap to the top of bar 6, where\nprofit takers came in, as did new strong bears. Profit taking came in just below the targets based on gaps 26 and 45.\nBreakout gaps often flip the always-in direction and therefore are an important sign of strength. Most traders would classify the following as\nbreakout gaps: gaps 3, 7, 11, 15, 18, 29, 32, 36, 44, and 47. When there is a breakout and a gap, look at the gap as a sign of strength and not as a\ntool to create a measured move target. When a trend is just beginning, it is a mistake to take profits too early. Do not use a reasonable candidate\nfor a breakout gap as a measuring gap.\nThe rally to bar 22 broke out above the bar 6 high, and the pullbacks to bars 23 and 24 were breakout tests. The space between the bar 24 low,\nwhere the market turned up again, and the bar 6 high is the breakout gap. Here, because the bar 24 low was below the bar 6 high, the breakout\ngap was negative. Since it was a breakout from a large trading range, it had a good chance of also being a measuring gap.\nSome experienced traders would have faded the breakout and shorted below bar 22, looking for a test of the breakout point and a quick scalp\ndown. The bulls were looking for the same thing and were ready to eagerly buy at the market or on limit orders when the pullback tested into the\ngap. The bulls originally bought the breakout in the move up to bar 22, and their eagerness to buy again at the same price enabled the new bull\ntrend to resume and go for at least some kind of measured move up (for example, it might have been based on the height of the pullback from the\nbar 22 high to the bar 23 low).\nAfter a trend has gone on for a while, traders will begin to look for a deeper pullback. A gap often appears before the correction, and that gap is\nan exhaustion gap, like gaps 5, 16, 27, 33, and 45.\nWhen a gap occurs as part of a series in a spike or within a trading range, it is usually not classified and most traders refer to it simply as a gap,\nlike gaps 19, 20, 37, and 38.\nFigure 6.2 Trend Bars Are the Same as Gaps\nTraditional gaps on intraday charts can usually be seen on 5 minute charts only if the volume is extremely light.

Every trend bar is a spike, a breakout, and a climax, and since every breakout is a variant of a gap,\nevery trend bar is a type of gap. Gaps on the open are common on most 5 minute charts. In Figure 6.3, bar 2 gapped beneath the low of the final\nbar of yesterday, creating an opening gap.\nThe market reversed up on bar 5, and at the time of the reversal, the odds of it being the start of a bull trend were good, given the strong bottom.\nBecause it was the start of a bull trend, it was a breakout gap. Some traders saw its body as the gap, and others thought that the gap was the\nspace between the high of bar 4 and the low of bar 6.\nBar 6 and bar 7 were also trend bars and therefore also gaps. It is common for trends to have gaps along the way and are a sign of strength.\nBar 11 was a breakout of the bull flag from bar 9 to bar 10 and a breakout above the opening range. Since the opening range was about half of\nthe size of an average daily range, traders were looking for a doubling of the range, and that made bar 11 a likely measuring gap as well as a\nbreakout gap.\nThe market hesitated for three bars between bar 12 and bar 13, in the area of yesterday's high, going into the close. Some traders saw this as\nthe top of today's opening range. Bar 13 was a bear reversal bar, and since the market might have traded below it, the bears saw it as a signal bar\nfor a failed breakout (of both the bar 9 high and the high of yesterday's close). Since the breakout was so strong, far more traders assumed that the\nfailed breakout sell signal would not succeed, and therefore placed limit orders to buy at and below its low. Those aggressive bulls were able to turn\nthe market up quickly on bar 14. The low of 14 then formed the top of the measuring gap, and the high of bar 9 was the bottom. Since bar 14 was\nan outside up bar, it was a breakout pullback buy entry that triggered the buy as the market went above the high of the prior bar (bar 13). The bull\ntrend went far beyond the measured move target. Had the bears succeeded in reversing the market down, bar 11 would have become an\nexhaustion gap instead of a measuring gap. As long as the pullback did not fall more than a tick or so below the bar 9 high, traders would have still\nlooked at the gap as a measuring gap, and they would have considered taking partial profits at the measured move target (the market raced up so\nsharply that many would not have exited at the target). If the market fell further, traders would not have trusted any measured move up based on the\nbar 11 gap, and instead would have looked for other ways to calculate measured move targets. At that point, referring to bar 11 as either a\nmeasuring or exhaustion gap would have been meaningless, and traders would no longer have thought of it in those terms. As long as the selloff did\nnot fall below the bar 10 high, the bulls would have considered the breakout to be successful. If it fell below the high of bar 10, or the low of bar 10,\ntraders would have then saw the market as in a trading range, or possibly even a bear trend, if the selloff was strong. Bar 14 was a breakout test of\nthe bar 11 gap. It missed the bar 9 breakout point by a tick and turned back up. By not letting the market fall below the bar 9 high or the bar 12 low,\nthe bulls were showing their strength.\nThe market broke out again on bar 15, which meant that bar 15 was a breakout gap and a potential measuring gap. Some traders would have\nused the height of the opening range for the measured move (the bar 4 low to the bar 13 high), and others would have used the middle of the gap\nbetween the bar 13 breakout point and the bar 15 pullback.\nBars 15 and 16 were also gaps in a bull trend, and therefore signs of strength.\nBar 17 was an especially large bull trend bar in a trend that had gone on for 10 or 20 bars, and therefore it was likely to function as an exhaustion\ntype of trend bar and a possible exhaustion gap. Buy climaxes sometimes lead to reversals but more often just lead to corrections that last about\n10 bars and often have two legs.\nBar 19 was another potential breakout gap, since it was the breakout above a small bull flag, but after a buy climax, more of a correction was\nlikely.\nBar 20 was an attempt at a bear breakout gap, but the body was too small; the bar did not break below the bottom of the developing trading\nrange (the low of the bar before bar 19).\nBar 22 was a breakout gap, and the bears hoped that it would lead to a measured move down (and therefore become a measuring gap). It had a\nlarge bear body and it broke below a five-bar ledge and the bottom of the trading range. However, in a strong bull trend, it could simply have been\npart of a test of the moving average, and it might simply have been due to a sell vacuum, with strong bulls and bears just waiting for slightly lower\nprices. The bulls were waiting to buy to initiate new longs, and the bears were waiting to take profits on their shorts.\nBar 23 extended the breakout, but there was no follow-through, and like most reversal attempts and most bear breakout attempts in bull trends, it\nfailed. Most traders wanted to see one more bear trend bar before they would have considered the market as having flipped to always-in short. This\nis a common situation, which is why aggressive bulls buy the closes of bars like 23, expecting that the bears would be unable to flip the market to\nshort. This allows those bulls to get long near the very bottom of the correction.\nBar 24 was a bull moving average gap bar and a signal bar for the end of two legs down from the bar 17 buy climax. Although bar 22 could be\nconsidered to be an exhaustion gap, since it was the end of a small bear trend, most traders still saw the market as always-in long and the trend as\nstill up, so there was no significant bear trend to exhaust. This was a pullback in a bull trend and not a new bear trend. Bar 22 was therefore just a\nfailed breakout.\nBar 25 was another breakout, since the market was reversing up from a pullback in a bull trend and therefore breaking above a bull flag (the bull\ninside bar after bar 23 was the signal bar for the bull flag entry).

That close created the\npossibility that bar 25 was a measuring gap, which it was once bar 26 turned the market up again after a one-bar pause. The rally went well above\nthe measured move target and 25 became a breakaway gap.\nSome traders still wondered whether a bear channel might be underway, but when bar 26 went above the bear trend bar before it and above the\ntop of bar 22 (the bear breakout gap), the bear theory was untenable for most traders.\nBars 27, 29, 32, and 40 were also bull breakout gaps.\nBar 36 was a breakout gap but the next bar reversed down. Some traders then saw bar 36 as an exhaustion gap and a possible end of the rally\nand the start of either a trading range or a larger correction.\nBars 37, 38, and 39 were bear gaps and signs of strength on the part of the bears (selling pressure).\nFigure 6.4 Intraday Gaps\nThis 5 minute Emini chart in Figure 6.4 illustrates a number of gaps. The only traditional gap occurred on the open when the low of the first bar of\nthe day gapped above the high of the final bar of yesterday. However, since the first bar did not gap above the high of yesterday, there was no gap\non the daily chart.\nThe market trended down to bar 13 and then rallied above the moving average, breaking the bear trend line. Notice how the low of bar 14 is\nabove the moving average and it is the first such bar in over a couple of hours. This is a moving average gap, and these gaps often lead to a test of\nthe bear low and then a two-legged move up, especially if the move up to the gap bar breaks above the bear trend line as it did here. Here, it led to\na higher low trend reversal at bar 15 and then a second leg up to bar 18.\nBar 6 broke out above the highs of bars 1 and 4, which became breakout points. The space between those highs and the low of bar 6 was a\ngap, and it was filled on the bar after bar 6. Day traders think of this as simply a gap up and an opening reversal down, but it is a form of an\nexhaustion gap.\nThe bear trend bar before bar 10 opened near its high, closed near its low, and had a relatively large range. Since it formed after the market had\ntrended down for many bars, it was a sell climax where there was a last gasp of selling with no one left who would be willing to sell until after a\npullback, which often has two legs. That breakout bar broke below many swing lows (bars 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9), and bar 11 became the breakout test.\nThere was also a large gap between the bar 10 high and the moving average, and that gap was filled by a two-legged move that formed a low 2\nshort setup.\nThe middle of the gap between the bar 9 breakout point and the bar 11 breakout test led to a measured move down from the bar 8 top of the\nchannel down to bar 9. The hash mark below and one bar to the right of the bar 10 low is the projection down from the two higher hash marks. This\ngap became a measuring gap. Instead of reversing up, as is common after a reversal up from a trend channel line overshoot, the market broke to\nthe downside and the bottom was at the measured move to the tick. Since you never know in advance which, if any, of the possible measured move\ntargets will work, it is good to draw all that you can see and look for a reversal at any of them. These are reasonable areas to take profits on shorts.\nIf there are other reasons to initiate a long, the chance of a profitable reversal trade increases if it occurs at a measured move. Here, for example,\nthe market broke below a trend channel line and the prior low of the day and reversed up at an exact measured move.\nAlthough the rally to bar 11 was close to the bars 7 and 9 breakout points, the gap was not filled. That is a sign that the bears were strong, and it\nwas followed by a new bear low.\nBar 13 was another big bear bar after a protracted bear trend and therefore a second sell climax. The next bar filled the gap below the bar 10\nlow.\nBar 14 was a second breakout test of the bars 7 and 9 double bottom, which was the breakout point. However, instead of the market falling, it\nwent sideways to bar 15 and formed a wedge bull flag. This led to a rally and a closure of the gap, and the breakout below bars 7 and 9 failed. The\nday tried to become a reversal day, as trending trading range days sometimes do, but the bull trend could not maintain control late in the day.\nBar 17 was a breakout pullback that tested the high of the bar 14 breakout point and led to a strong rally that stopped two ticks above the\nmeasured move from the bottom of bar 13 to the top of bar 11.

The rally went well above the measured move target and 25 became a breakaway gap.\nSome traders still wondered whether a bear channel might be underway, but when bar 26 went above the bear trend bar before it and above the top of bar 22 (the bear breakout gap), the bear theory was untenable for most traders.\nBars 27, 29, 32, and 40 were also bull breakout gaps.\nBar 36 was a breakout gap but the next bar reversed down.

The only traditional gap occurred on the open when the low of the first bar of the day gapped above the high of the final bar of yesterday. However, since the first bar did not gap above the high of yesterday, there was no gap on the daily chart.\nThe market trended down to bar 13 and then rallied above the moving average, breaking the bear trend line. Notice how the low of bar 14 is above the moving average and it is the first such bar in over a couple of hours. This is a moving average gap, and these gaps often lead to a test of the bear low and then a two-legged move up, especially if the move up to the gap bar breaks above the bear trend line as it did here. Here, it led to a higher low trend reversal at bar 15 and then a second leg up to bar 18.\nBar 6 broke out above the highs of bars 1 and 4, which became breakout points. The space between those highs and the low of bar 6 was a gap, and it was filled on the bar after bar 6. Day traders think of this as simply a gap up and an opening reversal down, but it is a form of an exhaustion gap.\nThe bear trend bar before bar 10 opened near its high, closed near its low, and had a relatively large range. Since it formed after the market had trended down for many bars, it was a sell climax where there was a last gasp of selling with no one left who would be willing to sell until after a pullback, which often has two legs. That breakout bar broke below many swing lows (bars 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9), and bar 11 became the breakout test.\nThere was also a large gap between the bar 10 high and the moving average, and that gap was filled by a two-legged move that formed a low 2 short setup.\nThe middle of the gap between the bar 9 breakout point and the bar 11 breakout test led to a measured move down from the bar 8 top of the channel down to bar 9. The hash mark below and one bar to the right of the bar 10 low is the projection down from the two higher hash marks. This gap became a measuring gap. Instead of reversing up, as is common after a reversal up from a trend channel line overshoot, the market broke to the downside and the bottom was at the measured move to the tick. Since you never know in advance which, if any, of the possible measured move targets will work, it is good to draw all that you can see and look for a reversal at any of them. These are reasonable areas to take profits on shorts.\nIf there are other reasons to initiate a long, the chance of a profitable reversal trade increases if it occurs at a measured move. Here, for example, the market broke below a trend channel line and the prior low of the day and reversed up at an exact measured move.\nAlthough the rally to bar 11 was close to the bars 7 and 9 breakout points, the gap was not filled. That is a sign that the bears were strong, and it was followed by a new bear low.\nBar 13 was another big bear bar after a protracted bear trend and therefore a second sell climax. The next bar filled the gap below the bar 10 low.\nBar 14 was a second breakout test of the bars 7 and 9 double bottom, which was the breakout point. However, instead of the market falling, it went sideways to bar 15 and formed a wedge bull flag. This led to a rally and a closure of the gap, and the breakout below bars 7 and 9 failed. The day tried to become a reversal day, as trending trading range days sometimes do, but the bull trend could not maintain control late in the day.\nBar 17 was a breakout pullback that tested the high of the bar 14 breakout point and led to a strong rally that stopped two ticks above the measured move from the bottom of bar 13 to the top of bar 11. The measured move hash marks are just to the right of the bar 13, and the distance from the bottom one to the middle one led to the projection up to the top one.\nBar 18 is another example of a large moving average gap, and the gap was filled within a couple of bars.\nThere are many other minor gaps as well, like between the low of bar 6 and the high bar 8.

When a magnet is below the market, it is a support level, which means that it is an area\nwhere bulls will initiate positions and bears will take profits on their shorts. When a magnet is above the market, it is a resistance level, which\nmeans that it is an area where bulls will take profits on their longs and bears will initiate shorts. Support and resistance are magnets that draw the\nmarket toward them. When you become aware of a magnet not too far from the current price, trade only in the direction of the magnet until after it is\nreached. At that point, you will have to decide if it looks like the market will reverse, go sideways, or ignore the magnet and keep trending. Magnets\ntell you the likely destination, but not the path, and there may be big pullbacks along the way. Also, the market might be in a trading range for\ndozens of bars, but within striking distance of a magnet. Although you should be aware of the magnet, there still can be reliable trades in both\ndirections as the market decides if it will test the magnet and how it will get there.\nTraders are constantly looking at support and resistance. The market has inertia and a strong propensity to continue what it has been doing.\nWhen it is trending, most attempts to reverse the trend will fail. For example, if the market is trending down, most support levels will fail to hold or\nreverse the market. However, all bull reversals happen at support levels (and all bear reversals happen at resistance levels), so if the market begins\nto reverse up, the potential reward is often many times larger than the risk. Even though the probability of success is often only 40 percent, the\ntrader's equation is still positive and the reversal trade is therefore mathematically sound. Inertia also means that when the market is in a trading\nrange, most attempts to break out will fail, and the market will repeatedly reverse up from the support created by the bottom of the range, and\nreverse down from the resistance at the top. Even though most attempts to reverse a trend will fail, all trend reversals and all pullbacks begin at\nsupport and resistance levels, so knowing where they are can lead traders to take profits and to enter reversal trades at optimal locations.\nMost Emini trading is done by computers, and their algorithms are based on logic and numbers. When they buy a falling market or sell a rally,\nthey are doing so because they calculated that the particular price was a logical location for them to place their trades. If enough algorithms are\nusing similar prices, the market can reverse, at least for a bar or two, and often enough for a profitable trade. Although some algorithms use\nnumbers that are not directly based on the Emini price chart (for example, they might use data based on the options markets or other related\nmarkets), unless many programs are coming up with similar numbers, it is unlikely that there will be enough force to change the direction of the\nmarket. When the market reverses, it always does so at support and resistance levels; with practice, an individual trader can usually spot them.\nBecause some of these reversals lead to profitable trades, and because these levels are sensible areas to take profits, it is useful to know where\npossible turning points are.\nOne of the important reasons to look for magnets is that they are logical areas to take partial or full profits. You should always be faster to take\nprofits on a trade than you should be to look for an entry in the opposite direction. This means that you need a stronger setup to initiate a trade in\nthe opposite direction than you need to take profits. If the move toward the magnet is weak and if it is against the direction of a larger trend, you can\nalso look to initiate a trade in the opposite direction, expecting a reversal. The market will usually overshoot the magnet, at least by a small amount,\nand if the move toward the magnet is not a strong trend, the market will usually reverse, at least for a bar or two. If the trend resumes and goes even\nfurther past the magnet and then reverses a second time, this is usually a reliable setup for a trade in the opposite direction, especially if there is a\nstrong reversal bar.\nAny significant type of price action can form support or resistance, and common examples include:\nTrend lines.\nTrend channel lines.\nAny type of moving average on any time frame.\nMeasured move targets.\nPrior swing highs or lows.\nBull entry bar lows and bear entry bar highs.\nBull signal bar highs and bear signal bar lows.\nYesterday's high, low, open, and close.\nThe high, low, open, or close of any bar, especially if the bar is a large trend bar.\nDaily pivots.\nFibonacci retracement levels and projections.\nAny type of band.\nSupport and resistance are terms created by traders to describe any price as having enough of a mathematical edge for a trader to place a\nprofitable trade. These terms were created by traders to help them spot trades. The high of every bar on every time frame is at some resistance\nlevel, the low of every bar is at support, and the close is where it is and not one tick higher or lower because computers put it there for a reason. The\nsupport and resistance may not be obvious, but since computers control everything and they use logic, everything has to make sense, even if it is\noften difficult to understand. Every price on the chart has some mathematical edge, but the edges are usually too small to be tradable except by\nhigh-frequency trading (HFT) programs, many of which are designed to scalp for a penny of profit. By definition, a price is support or resistance\nonly if it has a directional probability imbalance. For example, if a market falls to a level of support, traders believe that there is about a 60 percent\nchance or better that there will be at least a bounce big enough for a scalp, which is every trader's minimal trade. If the chance was only 52 or 53\npercent, traders would probably not consider that high enough to use the term and instead would just consider the price as unremarkable. If the\nmarket is in the middle of a trading range, the low of the prior bar is always at least a minimal area of support in the general sense of the word, but\nthat does not mean the expected bounce is big enough to place a profitable trade. If the expected bounce is only a couple of ticks, it is not support\nfrom a trader's perspective. If the current bar is still forming and it is on its low and is one tick above the low of the prior bar, there might be a 53\npercent chance of the market bouncing two ticks before it falls two ticks. However, that is too small an edge and too small a price movement for\ntraders to place a trade (although a high-frequency program might make that trade), and therefore traders would not call it support. The opposite is\ntrue for resistance.\n", "text_clean": "Part II\nMagnets: Support and Resistance There are two types of magnets: support and resistance.

If the trend resumes and goes even further past the magnet and then reverses a second time, this is usually a reliable setup for a trade in the opposite direction, especially if there is a strong reversal bar.\nAny significant type of price action can form support or resistance, and common examples include:\nTrend lines.\nTrend channel lines.\nAny type of moving average on any time frame.\nMeasured move targets.\nPrior swing highs or lows.\nBull entry bar lows and bear entry bar highs.\nBull signal bar highs and bear signal bar lows.\nYesterday's high, low, open, and close.\nThe high, low, open, or close of any bar, especially if the bar is a large trend bar.\nDaily pivots.\nFibonacci retracement levels and projections.\nAny type of band.\nSupport and resistance are terms created by traders to describe any price as having enough of a mathematical edge for a trader to place a profitable trade. These terms were created by traders to help them spot trades. The high of every bar on every time frame is at some resistance level, the low of every bar is at support, and the close is where it is and not one tick higher or lower because computers put it there for a reason. The support and resistance may not be obvious, but since computers control everything and they use logic, everything has to make sense, even if it is often difficult to understand. Every price on the chart has some mathematical edge, but the edges are usually too small to be tradable except by high-frequency trading (HFT) programs, many of which are designed to scalp for a penny of profit. By definition, a price is support or resistance only if it has a directional probability imbalance. For example, if a market falls to a level of support, traders believe that there is about a 60 percent chance or better that there will be at least a bounce big enough for a scalp, which is every trader's minimal trade. If the chance was only 52 or 53 percent, traders would probably not consider that high enough to use the term and instead would just consider the price as unremarkable. If the market is in the middle of a trading range, the low of the prior bar is always at least a minimal area of support in the general sense of the word, but that does not mean the expected bounce is big enough to place a profitable trade. If the expected bounce is only a couple of ticks, it is not support from a trader's perspective. If the current bar is still forming and it is on its low and is one tick above the low of the prior bar, there might be a 53 percent chance of the market bouncing two ticks before it falls two ticks. However, that is too small an edge and too small a price movement for traders to place a trade (although a high-frequency program might make that trade), and therefore traders would not call it support.

Once the market returns to a prior price, it will tend to do the same thing that it did\nthe last time it was there. For example, if the market falls through the bottom of a trading range and then rallies back to the bottom of the range, it\nwill usually sell off again because that's what it did when it was last at that price level. The traders who failed to exit their longs and rode through the\nbear leg will be eager to get a second chance to exit them with a smaller loss, and they will hold until the market rallies back and tests the breakout.\nAt that point, they will sell out of their longs and this will create selling pressure. Also, the shorts who took profits at the bottom of the sell-off will be\neager to short again on the rally. The combined selling by the bears and the liquidating bulls will create resistance to a further rally and usually drive\nthe market back down.\nWhen the market falls back to a price and hits it several times and bounces each time, it is finding support at that price level. If the market rallies\nto a price level and keeps falling back, the area is resistance. Any area of support or resistance acts as a magnet, drawing the market to the price.\nAs the market approaches, it enters the magnetic field, and the closer it gets, the stronger the magnetic pull is. This increases the odds of the\nmarket touching the price. That greater magnetic pull in part is generated by the vacuum effect. For example, if the market is having a bear rally\ntoward a bear trend line but has not yet hit it, the sellers will often step aside and wait for the test. If they believe the market will touch the line, it does\nnot make sense for them to sell just below the line when they can soon sell higher. The absence of selling creates a buy imbalance and therefore a\nvacuum effect that quickly sucks the market up. The result is often a bull trend bar. Then, the bull scalpers sell out of their longs for a profit and the\nbears sell to initiate new shorts. Since there was no clear bull reversal at the low, most of the bulls bought for scalps, expecting only a pullback and\nthen a resumption of the bear trend.\nOnce the market gets to the target, traders think that the market will now more likely go down far enough to place a profitable trade, and they\nappear out of nowhere and short aggressively and relentlessly, driving the market down. The weak bulls who bought at the top of that strong bull\ntrend bar are stunned that there is no follow-through, but they misunderstood the significance of the bull trend bar. They thought that traders were\nsuddenly convinced that the market was going to break above the trend line and a bull leg would begin. They were oblivious to the vacuum effect\nand did not consider that the bears were just waiting for the market to get a little higher. The strong bull trend bar was due to the bears briefly\nstepping aside rather than the bears buying back their shorts. The bulls who kept buying needed to find bears to take the other side of their trades\nand they could only find them higher, where the bears thought the market would begin to reverse. The market will continue down to an area of\nneutrality and usually beyond to the point that the bulls now have a mathematical edge. This is because the market never knows that it has gone far\nenough until it goes too far. Then it trades up and down above the area of neutrality, which becomes tighter and tighter as the bulls and bears are\nbetter able to define it. At some point, both perceive that the value is wrong and the market then breaks out again and begins a new search for\nvalue.\nEvery countertrend spike should be considered to be a vacuum effect pullback. For example, if there is a sharp bear spike on the 5 minute chart\nand then the market suddenly reverses into a bull leg, there was an area of support at the low, whether or not you saw it in advance. The bulls\nstepped aside until the market reached a level where they believed that value was considerable, and the opportunity to buy at this great price would\nbe brief. They came in and bought aggressively. The smart bears were aware of that magnet, and they used it as an opportunity to take profits on\ntheir shorts. The result was a market bottom on the 5 minute chart. That bottom, like all bottoms, occurred at some higher time frame support level,\nlike a bull trend line, a moving average, or a bear trend channel line at the bottom of a large bull flag. It is important to remember that if the 5 minute\nreversal was strong, you would buy based on that reversal, regardless of whether you saw support there on the daily or 60 minute chart. Also, you\nwould not buy at that low, even if you saw the higher time frame support, unless there was evidence on the 5 minute chart that it was forming a\nbottom. This means that you do not need to be looking at lots of different charts in search of that support level, because the reversal on the 5 minute\nchart tells you that it is there. If you are able to follow multiple time frames, you will see support and resistance levels before the market reaches\nthem, and this can alert you to look for a setup on the 5 minute chart when the market reaches the magnet. However, if you simply follow the 5\nminute chart carefully, it will tell you all that you need to know.\nIn general, if the market tests an area of support four or five times, the likelihood of breaking through that support increases and, at some point,\nthe breakout becomes more likely than not. If the buyers who lifted the market at this level fail repeatedly to do so again, they will give up at some\npoint and be overwhelmed by sellers. For example, if the market is resting above a flat moving average, traders will buy every touch of the moving\naverage, expecting a rally. If instead the market continues sideways and they don't even get enough of a rally to allow for a profitable scalp, at some\npoint they will sell their longs, thereby creating selling pressure. They will also stop buying touches of the moving average. This absence of buying\nwill increase the probability that the market will fall through the moving average. The bulls have decided that the moving average was not enough of\na discount for them to buy aggressively, and they will do so only on a further discount. If it does not find those buyers within 10 to 20 bars after falling\nbelow the moving average, the market will usually either trend down or continue in a trading range, but now below the moving average. Traders will\nbegin shorting rallies to the moving average, which will increase the chances that the market will begin to form lower highs and that the moving\naverage will start to trend down. Once the market falls through support, it usually becomes resistance; and once the market breaks above\nresistance, it usually becomes support.\nThis can also happen with a trend line or a trend channel line. For example, if a bull market pulls back to a trend line four or more times and it\ndoes not rally far above the trend line, at some point the bulls will stop buying tests of the trend line and they will begin to sell their longs, creating\nselling pressure. This is added to the selling of the bears, and since the bulls have stopped buying, the market will fall through the trend line.\nSometimes, however, the market will instead suddenly accelerate to the upside and the bears will stop shorting every small bounce and instead will\nbuy back their shorts, driving the market higher.\nInstitutional trading is done by discretionary traders and computers, and computer program trading has become increasingly important.\nInstitutions base their trading on fundamental or technical information, or a combination of both, and both types of trading are done by traders and\nby computers. In general, most of the discretionary traders base their decisions primarily on fundamental information, and most of the computer\ntrades are based on technical data. Since the majority of the volume is now traded by HFT firms, and most of the trades are based on price action\nand other technical data, most of the program trading is technically based. In the late twentieth century, a single institution running a large program\ncould move the market, and the program would create a micro channel, which traders saw as a sign that a program was running. Now, most days\nhave a dozen or so micro channels in the Emini, and many have over 100,000 contracts traded. With the Emini currently around 1200, that\ncorresponds to $6 billion, and is larger than a single institution would trade for a single small trade. This means that a single institution cannot move\nthe market very far or for very long, and that all movement on the chart is caused by many institutions trading in the same direction at the same time.\nAlso, HFT computers analyze every tick and are constantly placing trades all day long. When they detect a program, many will scalp in the direction\nof the program, and they will often account for most of the volume while the micro channel (program) is progressing.\nThe institutions that are trading largely on technical information cannot move the market in one direction forever because at some point the\nmarket will appear as offering value to the institutions trading on fundamentals.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 67, "text_raw": "institutions and other technical institutions will see the market as being at a great price to sell out of longs and to initiate shorts, and they will\noverwhelm the bullish technical trading and drive the market down. When the technical trading creates a bear trend, the market at some point will\nbe clearly cheap in the eyes of fundamental and other technical institutions. The buyers will come in and overwhelm the technical institutions\nresponsible for the selloff and reverse the market up.\nTrend reversals on all time frames always happen at support and resistance levels, because technical traders and programs look for them as\nareas where they should stop pressing their bets and begin to take profits, and many will also begin to trade in the opposite direction. Since they\nare all based on mathematics, computer algorithms, which generate 70 percent of all trading volume and 80 percent of institutional volume, know\nwhere they are. Also, institutional fundamental traders pay attention to obvious technical factors. They see major support and resistance on the\nchart as areas of value and will enter trades in the opposite direction when the market gets there. The programs that trade on value will usually find\nit around the same areas, because there is almost always significant value by any measure around major support and resistance. Most of the\nprograms make decisions based on price, and there are no secrets. When there is an important price, they all see it, no matter what logic they use.\nThe fundamental traders (people and machines) wait for value and commit heavily when they detect it. They want to buy when they think that the\nmarket is cheap and sell when they believe it is expensive. For example, if the market is falling, but it's getting to a price level where the institutions\nfeel like it is getting cheap, they will appear out of nowhere and buy aggressively. This is seen most dramatically and often during opening reversals\n(the reversals can be up or down and are discussed in the section on trading the open in book 3). The bears will buy back their shorts to take profits\nand the bulls will buy to establish new longs. No one is good at knowing when the market has gone far enough, but most experienced traders and\nprograms are usually fairly confident in their ability to know when it has gone too far.\nBecause the institutions are waiting to buy until the market has become clearly oversold, there is an absence of buyers in the area above a\npossible bottom, and the market is able to accelerate down to the area where they are confident that it is cheap. Some institutions rely on programs\nto determine when to buy and others are discretionary. Once enough of them buy, the market will usually turn up for at least a couple of legs and\nabout 10 or more bars on whatever time frame chart where this is happening. While it is falling, institutions continue to short all the way down until\nthey determine that it has reached a likely target and it is unlikely to fall any further, at which point they take profits. The more oversold the market\nbecomes, the more of the volume is technically based, because fundamental traders and programs will not continue to short when they think that the\nmarket is cheap and should soon be bought. The relative absence of buyers as the market gets close to a major support level often leads to an\nacceleration of the selling into the support, usually resulting in a sell vacuum that sucks the market below the support in a climactic selloff, at which\npoint the market reverses up sharply. Most support levels will not stop a bear trend (and most resistance levels will not stop a bull trend), but when\nthe market finally reverses up, it will be at an obvious major support level, like a long term trend line. The bottom of the selloff and the reversal up is\nusually on very heavy volume. As the market is falling, it has many rallies up to resistance levels and selloffs down to support levels along the way,\nand each reversal takes place when enough institutions determine that it has gone too far and is offering value for a trade in the opposite direction.\nWhen enough institutions act around the same level, a major reversal takes place.\nThere are fundamental and technical ways to determine support (and resistance). For example, it can be estimated with calculations, like what\nthe S&P 500 price earnings multiple should theoretically be, but these calculations are never sufficiently precise for enough institutions to agree.\nHowever, traditional areas of support and resistance are easier to see and therefore more likely to be noticed by many institutions, and they more\nclearly define where the market should reverse. In the crashes of both 1987 and 2008–2009, the market collapsed down to slightly below the\nmonthly trend line and then reversed up, creating a major bottom. The market will continue up, with many tests down, until it has gone too far, which\nis always at a significant resistance level. Only then can the institutions be confident that there is clear value in selling out of longs and selling into\nshorts. The process then reverses down.\nThe fundamentals (the value in buying or selling) determine the overall direction, but the technicals determine the actual turning points. The\nmarket is always probing for value, which is an excess, and is always at support and resistance levels. Reports and news items at any time can\nalter the fundamentals (the perception of value) enough to make the market trend up or down for minutes to several days. Major reversals lasting for\nmonths are based on fundamentals and begin and end at support and resistance levels. This is true of every market and every time frame.\nIt is important to realize that the news will report the fundamentals as still bullish after the market has begun to turn down from a major top, and still\nbearish after it has turned up from a major bottom. Just because the news still sees the market as bullish or bearish does not mean that the\ninstitutions do. Trade the charts and not the news. Price is truth and the market always leads the news. In fact, the news is always the most bullish at\nmarket tops and most bearish at market bottoms. The reporters get caught up in the euphoria or despair and search for pundits who will explain\nwhy the trend is so strong and will continue much longer. They will ignore the smartest traders, and probably do not even know who they are. Those\ntraders are interested in making money, not news, and will not seek out the reporters. When a reporter takes a cab to work and the driver tells him\nthat he just sold all of his stocks and mortgaged his house so that he could buy gold, the reporter gets excited and can't wait to find a bullish pundit\nto put on the air to confirm the reporter's profound insight in the gold bull market. “Just think, the market is so strong that even my cabbie is buying\ngold! Everyone will therefore sell all of their other assets and buy more, and the market will have to race higher for many more months!” To me,\nwhen even the weakest traders finally enter the market, there is no one left to buy. The market needs a greater fool who is willing to buy higher so\nthat you can sell out with a profit. When there is no one left, the market can only go one way, and it is the opposite of what the news is telling you. It is\ndifficult to resist the endless parade of persuasive professorial pundits on television who are giving erudite arguments about how gold cannot go\ndown and in fact will double again over the next year. However, you have to realize that they are there for their own self-aggrandizement and for\nentertainment. The network needs the entertainment to attract viewers and advertising dollars. If you want to know what the institutions are really\ndoing, just look at the charts. The institutions are too big to hide and if you understand how to read charts, you will see what they are doing and\nwhere the market is heading, and it is usually unrelated to anything that you see on television.\nMost major tops do not come from climaxes made of huge bars and volume, which are more common at major bottoms. More often, a top comes\nfrom a trading range, like a double top or a head and shoulders top, followed by a breakout in the form of a bear spike. However, tops can be\nclimactic, and bottoms can be trading ranges.\nThe chapters on trading ranges (further on) and channels (in book 1) describe how to use support and resistance to place trades. For example,\ntraders will buy near the bottom of a channel or other type of trading range and short near the top, and then take profits and reverse on the test of\nthe other side of the channel or trading range.\nIn a strong trend, the market extends beyond most magnets. For example, in a bull trend, beginning traders will discover that the rally continues\nup far beyond every measured move target and trend channel line that they draw. These beginners will mistakenly be shorting at every perceived\nresistance level, finding their losses growing all day long. They incorrectly keep shorting tops that look great but are bad, and refuse to buy\npullbacks that look bad but are great. However, once there finally is a pullback or a reversal, it will always occur at a resistance level. Even in strong\ntrends, measured move targets often work precisely to the tick. Obviously, this is in part because computers can calculate them accurately.\n", "text_clean": "institutions and other technical institutions will see the market as being at a great price to sell out of longs and to initiate shorts, and they will overwhelm the bullish technical trading and drive the market down. When the technical trading creates a bear trend, the market at some point will be clearly cheap in the eyes of fundamental and other technical institutions. The buyers will come in and overwhelm the technical institutions responsible for the selloff and reverse the market up.\nTrend reversals on all time frames always happen at support and resistance levels, because technical traders and programs look for them as areas where they should stop pressing their bets and begin to take profits, and many will also begin to trade in the opposite direction. Since they are all based on mathematics, computer algorithms, which generate 70 percent of all trading volume and 80 percent of institutional volume, know where they are. Also, institutional fundamental traders pay attention to obvious technical factors. They see major support and resistance on the chart as areas of value and will enter trades in the opposite direction when the market gets there. The programs that trade on value will usually find it around the same areas, because there is almost always significant value by any measure around major support and resistance. Most of the programs make decisions based on price, and there are no secrets. When there is an important price, they all see it, no matter what logic they use.\nThe fundamental traders (people and machines) wait for value and commit heavily when they detect it. They want to buy when they think that the market is cheap and sell when they believe it is expensive. For example, if the market is falling, but it's getting to a price level where the institutions feel like it is getting cheap, they will appear out of nowhere and buy aggressively. This is seen most dramatically and often during opening reversals (the reversals can be up or down and are discussed in the section on trading the open in book 3). The bears will buy back their shorts to take profits and the bulls will buy to establish new longs. No one is good at knowing when the market has gone far enough, but most experienced traders and programs are usually fairly confident in their ability to know when it has gone too far.\nBecause the institutions are waiting to buy until the market has become clearly oversold, there is an absence of buyers in the area above a possible bottom, and the market is able to accelerate down to the area where they are confident that it is cheap. Some institutions rely on programs to determine when to buy and others are discretionary. Once enough of them buy, the market will usually turn up for at least a couple of legs and about 10 or more bars on whatever time frame chart where this is happening. While it is falling, institutions continue to short all the way down until they determine that it has reached a likely target and it is unlikely to fall any further, at which point they take profits. The more oversold the market becomes, the more of the volume is technically based, because fundamental traders and programs will not continue to short when they think that the market is cheap and should soon be bought. The relative absence of buyers as the market gets close to a major support level often leads to an acceleration of the selling into the support, usually resulting in a sell vacuum that sucks the market below the support in a climactic selloff, at which point the market reverses up sharply. Most support levels will not stop a bear trend (and most resistance levels will not stop a bull trend), but when the market finally reverses up, it will be at an obvious major support level, like a long term trend line. The bottom of the selloff and the reversal up is usually on very heavy volume. As the market is falling, it has many rallies up to resistance levels and selloffs down to support levels along the way, and each reversal takes place when enough institutions determine that it has gone too far and is offering value for a trade in the opposite direction.\nWhen enough institutions act around the same level, a major reversal takes place.\nThere are fundamental and technical ways to determine support (and resistance). For example, it can be estimated with calculations, like what the S&P 500 price earnings multiple should theoretically be, but these calculations are never sufficiently precise for enough institutions to agree.\nHowever, traditional areas of support and resistance are easier to see and therefore more likely to be noticed by many institutions, and they more clearly define where the market should reverse. In the crashes of both 1987 and 2008–2009, the market collapsed down to slightly below the monthly trend line and then reversed up, creating a major bottom. The market will continue up, with many tests down, until it has gone too far, which is always at a significant resistance level. Only then can the institutions be confident that there is clear value in selling out of longs and selling into shorts. The process then reverses down.\nThe fundamentals (the value in buying or selling) determine the overall direction, but the technicals determine the actual turning points. The market is always probing for value, which is an excess, and is always at support and resistance levels. Reports and news items at any time can alter the fundamentals (the perception of value) enough to make the market trend up or down for minutes to several days. Major reversals lasting for months are based on fundamentals and begin and end at support and resistance levels. This is true of every market and every time frame.\nIt is important to realize that the news will report the fundamentals as still bullish after the market has begun to turn down from a major top, and still bearish after it has turned up from a major bottom. Just because the news still sees the market as bullish or bearish does not mean that the institutions do. Trade the charts and not the news. Price is truth and the market always leads the news. In fact, the news is always the most bullish at market tops and most bearish at market bottoms.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 70, "text_raw": "Chapter 7\nMeasured Moves Based on the Size of the First Leg (the Spike)\nA measured move is a swing that is equal in size to a prior swing in the same direction. You estimate how far the market will go on its second\nattempt based on how far it went on its first. Why do measured moves work? If you are looking for a measured move, then you believe that you\nknow the always-in direction, which means that you are probably at least 60 percent certain that the move will occur. The measured move is usually\nbased on the height of a spike or trading range, and the initial protective stop is usually beyond the beginning of the first move. For example, if there\nis a strong buy spike, then the initial protective stop is one tick below the low of the spike. If the spike is huge, traders will rarely risk that much, and\nwill usually still have a profitable trade, but the theoretical stop is still below the spike. Also, the probability is often more than 60 percent. If the spike\nis about four points tall, then the risk is about four points. Since you believe that the measured move will occur and that the strategy of buying at the\ntop of the spike is sound, then you are risking four points on a 60 percent bet. Mathematics dictates that your belief (that the strategy will be\nprofitable when the probability is 60 percent) will be true only if the reward is at least as big as the risk. This is discussed in Chapter 25 about the\nmathematics of trading. This means that for the strategy to work, you need to have a 60 percent chance of making at least four points, which is the\nmeasured move target. In other words, the only way that the strategy works is if the measured move target is hit about 60 percent of the time. Since\ntrading a trend is the most reliable form of trading, if there ever are strategies that work, then this has to be one. Is this the reason why measured\nmoves work? No one knows for sure, but it is a plausible explanation, and the best that I have imagined.\nMost measured moves are based either on spikes or on trading ranges. When one is based on a spike, it usually leads to a trading range; and\nwhen it is based on a trading range, it usually leads to a spike. For example, if there is a double top, which is a type of trading range, traders will\noften take partial profits once the breakout up or down reaches a measured move. Traders look for a breakout, which is a spike, and they usually\nexpect some profit taking once the spike has reached the measured move area. If the breakout was with a strong spike and there is no significant\npause at the measured move target, the spike itself often leads to a measured move based on the height of the spike. Once the market gets there,\ntraders will often begin to take profits and the result will usually be a trading range.\nOnce there is a pullback from a strong move, there is usually a second leg in the same direction, and it is often approximately the same size as\nthe first leg. This concept is the basis for a few reliable techniques to project a possible target for the end of that second leg. That measured move\narea is a reasonable place to take profits on your trend position, and then you can wait for another pullback to reestablish your position. If there is a\nstrong reversal setup, you can also consider a countertrend trade.\nWhen a market makes a sharp move and then has a pullback, it will likely have a second leg and the second leg is frequently approximately the\nsame size as the first. This is a leg 1 = leg 2 move, but it is also called an ABC move or an AB = CD. This alphabetical terminology is confusing,\nand it is simpler to just refer to the two moves as leg 1 and leg 2, and the pullback after leg 1 as simply the pullback. The confusion with the\nalphabetical labeling is that in the AB = CD pattern, the B, C, and D correspond to the A, B, and C of the ABC move. The B leg of an ABC is the\npullback and it creates a thick area on a Market Profile (CME Group's graph of price and time information). The middle of any thick area often\nleads to a measured move, and here the target is the same as the one based on AB = CD. For example, for the AB = CD in a bull trend, if you start\nat point A and add the length of the AB leg (which is B – A), then add that to C, you get C + (B – A). For the thick area, you start at A and then add\nthe length of the AB leg (which is B – A), then move back down to one-half of the thick area (so subtract half of the BC leg), and then add the height\nof B minus one-half of the BC thick area to get the measured move up from the middle of the BC thick area.

This is\nespecially true when the spike is strong, like one with exceptionally large trend bars or several strong trend bars with little overlap and small tails.\nWhen there is a strong spike, the market often makes a measured move in either direction, but usually in the with-trend direction based on some\ncombination of the open, close, high, or low of the first and last bars of the spike. For example, if there is a huge bull spike, take the number of\npoints from the open of the first bar of the spike to the close of the final bar of the spike and add that to the close of that final bar of the spike. The\nchannel that follows usually will find some resistance in that area and the market will often then correct down to the bottom of the channel. This\nmeasured move target is an area where you can take profits on your long position. Sometimes the market might make a measured move from the\nlow of the first bar of the spike to the close or high of the final bar of the spike, or from the open of the first bar to the high of the final bar, so it is\nprudent to look at all the possibilities. Less often, the market will not form much of a channel up and will reverse to below the bottom of the spike,\nand then make a measured move down.\nIt is important to remember that most of the time the market is in some kind of trading range and therefore the directional probability of an\nequidistant move is 50 percent. This means that the market is as likely to go up X number of points as it is to go down that same number of points.\nWhen there is a trend, the odds are better in the trend direction. When there is a strong spike, the odds of follow-through might be 60 percent and\nsometimes even 70 percent if the overall chart pattern is consistent with a strong trend move. Also, when the market is at the bottom of a trading\nrange, the probability favors a move up; and when it is at the top of the range, the probability favors a move down. This is because of market inertia,\nwhich means that the market tends to continue what is has been doing.

You estimate how far the market will go on its second attempt based on how far it went on its first. Why do measured moves work? If you are looking for a measured move, then you believe that you know the always-in direction, which means that you are probably at least 60 percent certain that the move will occur. The measured move is usually based on the height of a spike or trading range, and the initial protective stop is usually beyond the beginning of the first move. For example, if there is a strong buy spike, then the initial protective stop is one tick below the low of the spike. If the spike is huge, traders will rarely risk that much, and will usually still have a profitable trade, but the theoretical stop is still below the spike. Also, the probability is often more than 60 percent. If the spike is about four points tall, then the risk is about four points. Since you believe that the measured move will occur and that the strategy of buying at the top of the spike is sound, then you are risking four points on a 60 percent bet. Mathematics dictates that your belief (that the strategy will be profitable when the probability is 60 percent) will be true only if the reward is at least as big as the risk. This is discussed in Chapter 25 about the mathematics of trading. This means that for the strategy to work, you need to have a 60 percent chance of making at least four points, which is the measured move target. In other words, the only way that the strategy works is if the measured move target is hit about 60 percent of the time. Since trading a trend is the most reliable form of trading, if there ever are strategies that work, then this has to be one. Is this the reason why measured moves work? No one knows for sure, but it is a plausible explanation, and the best that I have imagined.\nMost measured moves are based either on spikes or on trading ranges. When one is based on a spike, it usually leads to a trading range; and when it is based on a trading range, it usually leads to a spike. For example, if there is a double top, which is a type of trading range, traders will often take partial profits once the breakout up or down reaches a measured move. Traders look for a breakout, which is a spike, and they usually expect some profit taking once the spike has reached the measured move area. If the breakout was with a strong spike and there is no significant pause at the measured move target, the spike itself often leads to a measured move based on the height of the spike. Once the market gets there, traders will often begin to take profits and the result will usually be a trading range.\nOnce there is a pullback from a strong move, there is usually a second leg in the same direction, and it is often approximately the same size as the first leg. This concept is the basis for a few reliable techniques to project a possible target for the end of that second leg. That measured move area is a reasonable place to take profits on your trend position, and then you can wait for another pullback to reestablish your position. If there is a strong reversal setup, you can also consider a countertrend trade.\nWhen a market makes a sharp move and then has a pullback, it will likely have a second leg and the second leg is frequently approximately the same size as the first. This is a leg 1 = leg 2 move, but it is also called an ABC move or an AB = CD. This alphabetical terminology is confusing, and it is simpler to just refer to the two moves as leg 1 and leg 2, and the pullback after leg 1 as simply the pullback. The confusion with the alphabetical labeling is that in the AB = CD pattern, the B, C, and D correspond to the A, B, and C of the ABC move. The B leg of an ABC is the pullback and it creates a thick area on a Market Profile (CME Group's graph of price and time information). The middle of any thick area often leads to a measured move, and here the target is the same as the one based on AB = CD. For example, for the AB = CD in a bull trend, if you start at point A and add the length of the AB leg (which is B – A), then add that to C, you get C + (B – A). For the thick area, you start at A and then add the length of the AB leg (which is B – A), then move back down to one-half of the thick area (so subtract half of the BC leg), and then add the height of B minus one-half of the BC thick area to get the measured move up from the middle of the BC thick area.

There was a strong bull spike made of three bull trend bars that broke\nout of a trading range. The next bar was a small doji bar, and this pause meant that the spike ended on the prior bar, which was the last of the\nconsecutive bull trend bars. The breakout was strong because there was very little overlap between the bars, with the open of each bar at or above\nthe close of the prior bar. The biggest tail on any bar was only two ticks, and a couple of bars had no tail on the bottom. The first bar was three and\na half points (14 ticks) tall, the second bar was 10 ticks tall, the third bar was eight ticks tall, and the fourth bar had a one-tick bull body but a three-\ntick tail on the bottom and a two-tick tail on the top. That doji was the first bar that lacked momentum and it therefore told you that the spike had\nended on the previous bar. The open of the first bar was eight points below the close of the third and final bull trend bar in the spike, so the spike\nshould be thought of as being eight points tall, at a minimum. You could use the low of the first bar to the high of the third bar or even the high of the\ndoji fourth bar, but it is more conservative to use the smaller figure for your initial projection. If the second leg surpasses this target, then look at\nother targets.\nAs that spike was forming, if you bought at any point, your stop on your trade might have to be below the bottom of the spike. For argument's\nsake, assume that you would risk to one tick below the open of the first bar of the spike. If you bought at the market at the highest tick when the\nspike was three points tall, then you would be risking about three points to make at least three points. At that moment, you believed that the market\nwould have a measured move up equal to the height of the spike, which was three points tall. You knew where your stop was, and you didn't yet\nknow where the top of the spike would be, but you knew that it would be at least as high as where you bought. Since you believed that the market\nwas trending, you felt that the odds were better than 50–50 that the market would go up three points before it fell and hit that stop three points\nbelow.\nAfter the spike continued to grow to seven points, you changed your assessment. You now believed that since the market was still trending, the\nodds were at least 50–50 that the market would go up seven more points before it fell seven points. At the moment, you already had four points of\nopen profit on a trade where you were hoping for three while you risked three. If you wanted, you could have bought more at the high tick of the\nspike, which was still forming, and then your risk would have been seven points (maybe a few ticks more since you would probably have wanted to\nrisk to one tick below the bottom of the first bar of the spike), and your profit target would be seven points higher. However, on your initial long, you\nwere still risking three points but now had better than a 50 percent chance of making a total of 11 points (the four from your entry to the current top of\nthe spike, and then seven more).\nOnce that fourth bar formed, which was a doji, you then knew that the spike up had ended at the close of the prior bar, eight points above the\nopen of the first bar of the spike. At that point, you would have concluded that the market had more than a 50 percent chance of going up eight more\npoints above the close of the spike before falling eight points to below the open or bottom of the spike (maybe a tick or two more than eight points\non the downside, since the safest stop was beyond the start of the spike). Since the spike was so strong, the probability was likely more than 60\npercent.\nAs soon as the spike ended, two-sided trading began, and at that point uncertainty increased. The market corrected sideways to down and then\nthe channel up began. Although the market might have made a leg 1 = leg 2 move up from the bottom of this pullback, where the spike was leg 1\nand the channel was leg 2, when a spike is very strong, the more reliable target is the one based on the open of the first bar of the spike to the\nclose of the final bar of the spike. As the market rallies, the probability of higher prices slowly erodes. When the bull channel reached about half of\nthe distance to the measured move target, the directional probability of an equidistant move fell back to around 50 to 55 percent and uncertainty\nonce again was very high. Remember, a bull channel is usually followed by a move back down to the bottom of the channel and then at least a\nbounce, so the bull channel was actually the first leg of a trading range that had not yet formed. Once the market made it to the measured move\ntarget area, it was likely the high end of that incipient range, and the odds favored a move down. This is true of all trading ranges. This is an\nexcellent area to take profits on your longs, and because so many traders take profits in the area of the measured move, the market begins to pull\nback. Most traders will not look to buy aggressively again until the market retraces to around the bottom of the channel, where a double bottom\nusually forms. This area is also a magnet. The bulls begin to buy again and the bears who shorted at the top of the channel will take profits. Since\nthe market is now around the bottom of the developing trading range, the directional probability slightly favors the bulls.\nOnce the market enters the trading range, the directional probability of an equidistant move is again 50–50 whenever the market is near the\nmiddle of that range. If your risk is X points, you have a 50 percent chance of making X points before your stop is hit, and a 50 percent chance of\nlosing X points before your profit target is reached. This is a by-product of the markets being relatively efficient. Most of the time, they are efficient\nand the odds of making X points before losing X points are close to 50–50. The best trading occurs when the odds are better than 50–50, but this\noften occurs during spikes, which are emotional, fast moving, and difficult to enter. Traders understand this and that is why the spike grows so\nquickly without any pullbacks. Traders keep adding to their positions all the way up because they know that until the spike ends, the odds of making\nas much as they are risking are better than 50–50, and the odds fall to about 50–50 only once the channel is well underway. When that spike is\nforming, they do not know if there will be a pullback before the market goes higher, but they are confident that it will go higher in the near term.\nRather than waiting for a pullback that may never come and therefore missing out on a strong trade, they buy at the market or on one- to four-tick\npullbacks and risk to around the bottom of the spike. This urgency is behind the formation of spikes, and the increased risk keeps many traders\naway. Most beginners are unwilling to risk the three to seven points. Instead, they should simply buy a small position, maybe one-quarter of their\nnormal size, and take the risk, because that is what the institutions are doing. They understand the math and therefore are not afraid to take the\ntrade.\nThis move toward a 50–50 market is the basis of all measured move trades. The odds are out of balance, and the rally to the measured move is\nan attempt to restore uncertainty. The market invariably overshoots and has to backtrack to home in on a 50–50 market. The measured move area\nis an overshoot of the odds, and they then briefly favor the bears. Once the market retraces to the bottom of the channel, the odds again overshoot,\nbut this time in favor of the bulls.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 75, "text_raw": "Chapter 8\nMeasured Moves Based on Gaps and Trading Ranges\nGaps are common on daily charts where the low of one bar is above the high of the prior bar or the high of a bar is below the low of the prior bar. If\nthere is conviction about the direction of the market, the middle of the gap often becomes the middle of the trend. As the market gets near the\nmeasured move target, traders will look carefully at the exact target and often take partial or total profits in that area, and some traders will begin to\ntake positions in the opposite direction. This often leads to a pause, a pullback, or even a reversal.\nWhen a breakout occurs on an intraday chart, only rarely will this kind of gap appear. However, there is often something just as reliable, which is\na gap between the breakout point and the first pause or pullback. For example, if the market breaks out above a swing high and the breakout bar is\na relatively large bull trend bar and the low of the next bar is above the breakout point, then there is a gap between that low and the breakout point\nand that often becomes a measuring gap. If the bar after the breakout is also a large bull trend bar, then wait for the first small bull trend bar, bear\ntrend bar, or doji bar. Its low is then the top of the gap. If the breakout point or the breakout pullback is unclear, the market will often just use the\nmiddle of the breakout bar as the middle of the gap. In this case, the measured move is based on the start of the rally to the middle of the breakout\nbar. The market would then be expected to rally for about the same number of ticks above that level.\nIf the market pulls back within a few bars of breaking out and the low of the pullback is in the gap, then the gap is now smaller but its midpoint still\ncan be used to find a measured move target. If the market pulls back further, even to a little below the gap, the midpoint between the breakout point\nand that pullback can still be used for the projection. Since the difference between the breakout pullback and the breakout point is then a negative\nnumber, I call this a negative gap. Measured move projections are less reliable when they are based on a negative gap.\nOn a Market Profile, these intraday measuring gaps where the market moves quickly are thin areas between two distributions, and represent\nprices where the market is one-sided. The distributions are “fat” areas and are simply trading ranges where there is two-sided trading taking place.\nA trading range is an area of agreement on price, and its middle is the middle of what bulls and bears think is fair. A gap is also an area of\nagreement. It is an area where the bulls and bears agree that no trading should take place, and its middle is the midpoint of that area. In both\ncases, on a simplistic level, if those prices are a midpoint of agreement between bulls and bears, then they are a rough guide to the midpoint of the\nleg that contains them. Once they form, swing part or all of your with-trend entries. As the target is approached, consider countertrend entries if\nthere is a good setup. Most traders use the height of the prior trading range for measuring, which is fine because the exact distance is only\napproximate no matter how you do it (unless you are a Fibonacci or Elliott Wave trader and have the uncanny ability to convince yourself that the\nmarket almost always creates perfect patterns, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary). The key is to trade only with the trend, but once\nthe market is in the area of the measured move, you can begin to look for countertrend entries. However, the best countertrend trades only follow an\nearlier countertrend move that was strong enough to break the trend line.\nIf the market pauses after the measured move is reached, the two strong trend legs might be simply the end of a higher time frame correction,\nand if that appears to be the case, then swing part of any countertrend entry. Two legs often complete a move, and the move is usually followed by\nat least a protracted countertrend move that has at least two legs, and it sometimes becomes a new, opposite trend. The countertrend move will\noften test all the way back to the breakout point.\nSometimes the projections are exact to the tick, but most of the time the market undershoots or overshoots the target. This approach is only a\nguideline to keep you trading on the correct side of the market.\nFigure 8.1 Measuring Gap\nThe middle of a gap often leads to a measured move. In Figure 8.1, the Emini had a gap up at bar 3, above the bar 2 high of the previous day, and\nthe middle of that gap was a possible middle of the move up. Traders measured from the bar 1 bottom of the rally to the middle of the gap and then\nprojected that same number of points upward. Bar 4 came within a couple of ticks of the projection, but many traders believe that a target in the\nEmini has not been adequately tested unless the market comes to within one tick of it. This gave traders confidence to buy the sharp sell-off on the\nopen of the next day down to bar 5. The high of the day was two ticks above the measured move projection. The market sold off on the next day\ndown to bar 7 but rallied again to test just below the target. On the following day, the bulls gave up and there was a large gap down and then a sell-\noff. There were certainly news announcements that the television pundits used to explain all of the moves, but the reality was that the moves were\nbased on math. The news was just the excuse for the market to do what it was already going to do.\nFigure 8.2 Measuring Gaps\n", "text_clean": "Chapter 8\nMeasured Moves Based on Gaps and Trading Ranges Gaps are common on daily charts where the low of one bar is above the high of the prior bar or the high of a bar is below the low of the prior bar. If there is conviction about the direction of the market, the middle of the gap often becomes the middle of the trend. As the market gets near the measured move target, traders will look carefully at the exact target and often take partial or total profits in that area, and some traders will begin to take positions in the opposite direction. This often leads to a pause, a pullback, or even a reversal.\nWhen a breakout occurs on an intraday chart, only rarely will this kind of gap appear. However, there is often something just as reliable, which is a gap between the breakout point and the first pause or pullback. For example, if the market breaks out above a swing high and the breakout bar is a relatively large bull trend bar and the low of the next bar is above the breakout point, then there is a gap between that low and the breakout point and that often becomes a measuring gap. If the bar after the breakout is also a large bull trend bar, then wait for the first small bull trend bar, bear trend bar, or doji bar. Its low is then the top of the gap. If the breakout point or the breakout pullback is unclear, the market will often just use the middle of the breakout bar as the middle of the gap. In this case, the measured move is based on the start of the rally to the middle of the breakout bar. The market would then be expected to rally for about the same number of ticks above that level.\nIf the market pulls back within a few bars of breaking out and the low of the pullback is in the gap, then the gap is now smaller but its midpoint still can be used to find a measured move target. If the market pulls back further, even to a little below the gap, the midpoint between the breakout point and that pullback can still be used for the projection. Since the difference between the breakout pullback and the breakout point is then a negative number, I call this a negative gap. Measured move projections are less reliable when they are based on a negative gap.\nOn a Market Profile, these intraday measuring gaps where the market moves quickly are thin areas between two distributions, and represent prices where the market is one-sided. The distributions are “fat” areas and are simply trading ranges where there is two-sided trading taking place.\nA trading range is an area of agreement on price, and its middle is the middle of what bulls and bears think is fair. A gap is also an area of agreement. It is an area where the bulls and bears agree that no trading should take place, and its middle is the midpoint of that area. In both cases, on a simplistic level, if those prices are a midpoint of agreement between bulls and bears, then they are a rough guide to the midpoint of the leg that contains them. Once they form, swing part or all of your with-trend entries. As the target is approached, consider countertrend entries if there is a good setup. Most traders use the height of the prior trading range for measuring, which is fine because the exact distance is only approximate no matter how you do it (unless you are a Fibonacci or Elliott Wave trader and have the uncanny ability to convince yourself that the market almost always creates perfect patterns, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary). The key is to trade only with the trend, but once the market is in the area of the measured move, you can begin to look for countertrend entries. However, the best countertrend trades only follow an earlier countertrend move that was strong enough to break the trend line.\nIf the market pauses after the measured move is reached, the two strong trend legs might be simply the end of a higher time frame correction, and if that appears to be the case, then swing part of any countertrend entry. Two legs often complete a move, and the move is usually followed by at least a protracted countertrend move that has at least two legs, and it sometimes becomes a new, opposite trend. The countertrend move will often test all the way back to the breakout point.\nSometimes the projections are exact to the tick, but most of the time the market undershoots or overshoots the target. This approach is only a guideline to keep you trading on the correct side of the market.\nFigure 8.1 Measuring Gap The middle of a gap often leads to a measured move. In Figure 8.1, the Emini had a gap up at bar 3, above the bar 2 high of the previous day, and the middle of that gap was a possible middle of the move up. Traders measured from the bar 1 bottom of the rally to the middle of the gap and then projected that same number of points upward. Bar 4 came within a couple of ticks of the projection, but many traders believe that a target in the Emini has not been adequately tested unless the market comes to within one tick of it. This gave traders confidence to buy the sharp sell-off on the open of the next day down to bar 5. The high of the day was two ticks above the measured move projection. The market sold off on the next day down to bar 7 but rallied again to test just below the target. On the following day, the bulls gave up and there was a large gap down and then a selloff. There were certainly news announcements that the television pundits used to explain all of the moves, but the reality was that the moves were based on math. The news was just the excuse for the market to do what it was already going to do.\nFigure 8.2 Measuring Gaps", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["Chapter 8", "Measured Moves Based on Gaps and Trading Ranges", "Gaps are common on daily charts where the low of one bar is above the high of the prior bar or the high of a bar is below the low of the prior bar.

In the example of that bear trend that reversed up, that earliest buy signal is often at the start of a\nbear channel.

The market will try to rally to the top of those bull signal bars. As it is going up, the directional probability falls back to 50\npercent, and it continues to fall further as the market gets near the top of the range. Since that top is never known in advance and the middle of the\ntrading range where the directional probability is neutral is never known in advance, the market overshoots until it hits some technical level where\ntraders believe it is clearly overdone. This is often at the level of those earlier buy signals.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 81, "text_raw": "Part III\nPullbacks: Trends Converting to Trading Ranges\nEven when a chart is in a strong trend, it will have periods of two-sided trading, but as long as traders believe that the trend will resume, these are\nonly pullbacks. These trading ranges are small enough for traders to view them as just brief pauses in the trend, rather than the dominant feature of\nthe chart. All pullbacks are small trading ranges on the chart that you are viewing, and all trading ranges are pullbacks on higher time frame charts.\nHowever, on the chart in front of you, most attempts to break out of a trading range fail, but most attempts to break out of a pullback succeed. On\nhigher time frame charts, the trading range is a simple pullback, and if you are trading on that chart, you can trade it like any other pullback. Since\nthe bars are larger on a higher time frame chart, your risk is greater, and you have to reduce your position size. Most traders prefer to trade off a\nsingle time frame and not switch back and forth taking different-sized positions and using different-sized stops and profit targets depending on the\ntime frame.\nIf the market is in a strong trend and everyone expects the trend to continue, why would a pullback ever happen? To understand why, consider the\nexample of a bull trend. The reversal down into the pullback is due to profit taking by the bulls and, to a lesser extent, scalping by the bears. Bulls will\ntake profits at some point because they know that it is the mathematically optimal thing to do. If they hold forever, the market will almost always work\nback down to their entry price and will eventually go far below, creating a large loss. They never know for certain where the optimum place is to take\nprofits, and they use resistance levels as their best estimate. These levels may or may not be obvious to you, but because they offer opportunities\nto traders, it is important to look for them constantly. Trend scalpers and swing traders, as well as countertrend scalpers, expect the pullback and\ntrade accordingly. When the market reaches a target where enough bulls think that they should take profits, their lack of new buying and their selling\nout of their longs will cause the market to pause. The target can be any resistance level (discussed in the chapters on support and resistance in\nPart II of this book), or a certain number of ticks above an important signal bar (like six, 10, or 18 in the Emini). The bar might have a bull body that\nis smaller than the bull body of the prior bar, it might have a tail on the top, or the next bar might be a small bar with a bear body. These are all signs\nthat the bulls are less willing to buy at the top of the swing, that some bulls are taking profits, and that bears are beginning to short for scalps. If\nenough bulls and bears sell, the pullback will become larger and the current bar might fall below the low of the prior bar. In a strong bull spike,\ntraders will expect that the bull trend will immediately resume, so both the bulls and bears will buy around the low of the prior bar. This creates a high\n1 buy signal and is usually followed by a new high. As a bull trend matures and weakens, more two-sided trading will develop, and both the bulls\nand the bears will expect a pullback to fall for more ticks and last for more bars. The market might form a high 2 buy signal, a triangle, or a wedge\nbull flag. This creates a small downtrend, and when it reaches some mathematical target, the bulls will begin to buy again, and the bears will take\nprofits and buy back their shorts. Neither will sell again until the market rallies far enough for the process to repeat.\nSome of the buying also begins to dry up as bulls become unwilling to continue buying only one- to three-tick dips. They grow cautious and\nsuspect that a larger pullback is imminent. Because they believe that they will be able to buy six to 10 ticks or more below the high, there is no\nincentive for them to buy any higher. Also, there is an incentive for them to take partial or full profits because they believe that the market will soon\nbe lower, where they can buy again and make additional profits as the market rallies to test the most recent high. Momentum programs sense the\nloss of momentum and will also take profits and not enter again until momentum in either direction returns. Bears also see the weakening of the\ntrend and begin to sell above the highs of bars and above swing highs for scalps, and they scale in higher. Once they see more selling pressure,\nthey will also short below the lows of bars, expecting a deeper pullback.\nMost bulls will exit their longs on a weaker sell signal than they would need to take short positions. They initially look to take profits on strength,\nlike above a swing high or the high of the prior bar or on the close of a large bull trend bar. After taking profits on strength, they will then look to take\nprofits on the remainder of their positions on weakness, and begin to sell out of their longs below bear reversal bars; they suspect that the pullbacks\nwill become larger. Most will not join the bears in shorting, because most traders are unable to reverse a trade consistently well. They have been\nthinking that the market was going up, and usually need to get out of their longs for several minutes before they can convince themselves that they\nshould take a trade in the opposite direction. If they believe that the market is only pulling back and not reversing, they will instead look to buy back\ntheir longs once they think that the pullback has ended. Since most cannot or will not reverse, they don't want to be short when they are looking to\nbuy. If they took the short scalp, they would most likely not be able to reverse back to long, and they would find themselves trapped out of a bull\nswing because they tried to make a small bear scalp. It does not make mathematical sense to try to make one point on a low-probability short and\nend up missing two to four points on a high-probability long.\nIn a bull trend, there is a series of higher highs and higher lows. When the trend is strong, bulls will buy for any reason, and many will trail their\nprotective stops. If the market makes a new high, they will raise their stops to below the most recent higher low. If enough bears short and enough\nbulls take profits, the reversal can be stronger than what traders initially expected. This often happens later in a trend, after several prior pullbacks\nwere followed by new bull highs. However, both the bulls and the bears believe that the market will turn back up above the most recent swing low,\nand both will usually buy at or above that low. This results in either a double bottom bull flag or another higher low. The sell-off can be sharp, but as\nlong as enough traders believe that the bull trend is intact, traders will buy and the market will test the old high, where bulls will take partial or full\nprofits, and the bears will short again.\nAs the bull trend matures, traders will only look to buy a deeper correction, and they expect the market to make two-legged corrections, where the\nsecond leg falls below the low of the first. The price action tells traders when a deeper correction like this is likely, and when they believe that it is,\nthey will no longer trail their protective stops below the most recent swing low.

These trading ranges are small enough for traders to view them as just brief pauses in the trend, rather than the dominant feature of the chart. All pullbacks are small trading ranges on the chart that you are viewing, and all trading ranges are pullbacks on higher time frame charts.\nHowever, on the chart in front of you, most attempts to break out of a trading range fail, but most attempts to break out of a pullback succeed. On higher time frame charts, the trading range is a simple pullback, and if you are trading on that chart, you can trade it like any other pullback. Since the bars are larger on a higher time frame chart, your risk is greater, and you have to reduce your position size. Most traders prefer to trade off a single time frame and not switch back and forth taking different-sized positions and using different-sized stops and profit targets depending on the time frame.\nIf the market is in a strong trend and everyone expects the trend to continue, why would a pullback ever happen? To understand why, consider the example of a bull trend. The reversal down into the pullback is due to profit taking by the bulls and, to a lesser extent, scalping by the bears. Bulls will take profits at some point because they know that it is the mathematically optimal thing to do. If they hold forever, the market will almost always work back down to their entry price and will eventually go far below, creating a large loss. They never know for certain where the optimum place is to take profits, and they use resistance levels as their best estimate. These levels may or may not be obvious to you, but because they offer opportunities to traders, it is important to look for them constantly. Trend scalpers and swing traders, as well as countertrend scalpers, expect the pullback and trade accordingly. When the market reaches a target where enough bulls think that they should take profits, their lack of new buying and their selling out of their longs will cause the market to pause. The target can be any resistance level (discussed in the chapters on support and resistance in\nPart II of this book), or a certain number of ticks above an important signal bar (like six, 10, or 18 in the Emini). The bar might have a bull body that\nis smaller than the bull body of the prior bar, it might have a tail on the top, or the next bar might be a small bar with a bear body. These are all signs that the bulls are less willing to buy at the top of the swing, that some bulls are taking profits, and that bears are beginning to short for scalps. If enough bulls and bears sell, the pullback will become larger and the current bar might fall below the low of the prior bar. In a strong bull spike, traders will expect that the bull trend will immediately resume, so both the bulls and bears will buy around the low of the prior bar. This creates a high 1 buy signal and is usually followed by a new high. As a bull trend matures and weakens, more two-sided trading will develop, and both the bulls and the bears will expect a pullback to fall for more ticks and last for more bars. The market might form a high 2 buy signal, a triangle, or a wedge bull flag. This creates a small downtrend, and when it reaches some mathematical target, the bulls will begin to buy again, and the bears will take profits and buy back their shorts. Neither will sell again until the market rallies far enough for the process to repeat.\nSome of the buying also begins to dry up as bulls become unwilling to continue buying only one- to three-tick dips. They grow cautious and suspect that a larger pullback is imminent. Because they believe that they will be able to buy six to 10 ticks or more below the high, there is no incentive for them to buy any higher. Also, there is an incentive for them to take partial or full profits because they believe that the market will soon be lower, where they can buy again and make additional profits as the market rallies to test the most recent high. Momentum programs sense the loss of momentum and will also take profits and not enter again until momentum in either direction returns. Bears also see the weakening of the trend and begin to sell above the highs of bars and above swing highs for scalps, and they scale in higher. Once they see more selling pressure, they will also short below the lows of bars, expecting a deeper pullback.\nMost bulls will exit their longs on a weaker sell signal than they would need to take short positions. They initially look to take profits on strength, like above a swing high or the high of the prior bar or on the close of a large bull trend bar. After taking profits on strength, they will then look to take profits on the remainder of their positions on weakness, and begin to sell out of their longs below bear reversal bars; they suspect that the pullbacks will become larger. Most will not join the bears in shorting, because most traders are unable to reverse a trade consistently well. They have been thinking that the market was going up, and usually need to get out of their longs for several minutes before they can convince themselves that they should take a trade in the opposite direction. If they believe that the market is only pulling back and not reversing, they will instead look to buy back their longs once they think that the pullback has ended. Since most cannot or will not reverse, they don't want to be short when they are looking to buy. If they took the short scalp, they would most likely not be able to reverse back to long, and they would find themselves trapped out of a bull swing because they tried to make a small bear scalp. It does not make mathematical sense to try to make one point on a low-probability short and end up missing two to four points on a high-probability long.\nIn a bull trend, there is a series of higher highs and higher lows. When the trend is strong, bulls will buy for any reason, and many will trail their protective stops. If the market makes a new high, they will raise their stops to below the most recent higher low. If enough bears short and enough bulls take profits, the reversal can be stronger than what traders initially expected. This often happens later in a trend, after several prior pullbacks were followed by new bull highs. However, both the bulls and the bears believe that the market will turn back up above the most recent swing low, and both will usually buy at or above that low. This results in either a double bottom bull flag or another higher low. The sell-off can be sharp, but as long as enough traders believe that the bull trend is intact, traders will buy and the market will test the old high, where bulls will take partial or full profits, and the bears will short again.\nAs the bull trend matures, traders will only look to buy a deeper correction, and they expect the market to make two-legged corrections, where the second leg falls below the low of the first. The price action tells traders when a deeper correction like this is likely, and when they believe that it is, they will no longer trail their protective stops below the most recent swing low. They will look to take profits higher, like above the most recent swing high, and then look to buy again around that low, reestablishing their longs. It does not make sense for them to rely on a stop below the most recent higher low once they believe that the market is likely to have a two-legged correction and, therefore, fall below that low. They will exit most or all of their position before that happens, but still remain bullish. The bull trend is no longer forming higher highs and higher lows. However, this lower low is usually still above the most recent higher low on a higher time frame chart, so the larger bull trend is still intact.

Bulls who bought the pullback will take profits below the trend high, and bears will begin to short aggressively\nbelow the old high, expecting a lower high and second leg down.\nOnce the market begins to make lower highs, the bulls will usually only look to buy deeper pullbacks, and their absence of buying helps to create\nthose deeper pullbacks. The bears see the same price action, and transition to holding on to their shorts for larger profits, expecting the sell-offs to\nbecome larger. The market repeatedly sells off around (slightly above, at, or below) the old high, but continues to rally from around the old low.\nUpside and downside breakout attempts fail, and the market loses its direction, creating near-term uncertainty. This is the hallmark of a trading\nrange. There will be repeated attempts by the bulls to resume the trend and by the bears to reverse the trend, and 80 percent of both fail. Since a\ntrading range in a bull trend is just a bull flag on a higher time frame chart, the odds favor an upside breakout. There will always be some pattern\nthat the bulls and bears will recognize as a sign that the bull trend is about to resume. When a credible one appears, fewer bears will be willing to\nscalp shorts on the rally, and the bulls will begin to continue to buy toward the top of the range. With fewer bears willing to short and fewer bulls\nwilling to sell out of their longs, the rally will break above the trading range. If the breakout is strong, the bears who were building a swing position,\nexpecting a larger correction or a reversal, will buy back their shorts and not look to short again for at least several more bars. With neither the\nscalping nor the swinging bears now shorting and the bulls not taking profits, the market usually runs for about a measured move up, equal to about\nthe height of the trading range. Bulls will then begin to take profits and bears will again short. If the selling is strong, there will be a pullback, a\ntrading range, or even a reversal down.\nThe opposite happens in a bear trend. The pullbacks are initially due to bears taking profits on new lows, but there is always some buying by\naggressive bulls who think that the market will rally far enough for them to make a profitable scalp. Once the market has rallied to some resistance\nlevel, usually in a low 2 or low 3 pattern, the bulls will sell out of their longs as they take profits, and the bears will short again. The bears want the\nmarket to continue to make lower highs and lows. Whenever they see a sharp rally, they will aggressively short when it approaches the most recent\nlower high. They sometimes don't short heavily until the market reaches the most recent swing high, which is why double top bear flags are so\ncommon. As long as the market continues to make lower highs, they know that most traders will see the bear trend as being intact, and therefore\nlikely to be followed by another lower low, where they can take partial or full profits on their shorts. Eventually a pullback will evolve into a trading\nrange, and there will be some rallies above the most recent lower highs. On a higher time frame chart, there will still be lower highs and lows, but on\nthe chart that you are trading, this higher high is a sign that the bear trend has lost some of its strength. As bear trends mature and weaken, they\noften form two-legged rallies where there is both a higher low and a higher high, but the bear trend is still intact. This is the basis for a low 2 short\nsetup, which is simply a two-legged rally. There will be some pattern within the range that will tell both bulls and bears that the bear trend is likely to\nresume, and it will always be at a resistance level, like a measured move or a trend line. This will make bulls less willing to buy near the bottom of\nthe range and bears more willing to continue to sell all the way to the bottom. The market then breaks to the downside, the bull scalpers stop buying,\nand the bull swing traders sell out of their longs. The market then falls for about a measured move, where the bears will begin to take profits and the\naggressive bulls will once again begin to buy. If the buying by the bulls and the bears is strong enough, there will be a pullback, a trading range, or a\ntrend reversal up.\nThe final leg of a pullback is often a micro channel against the trend (a bear micro channel at the end of a bull flag or a bull micro channel at the\nend of a bear flag). The breakout of a micro channel usually only goes for a bar or two before there is a pullback, especially if the micro channel has\nfour or more bars. If the trend is strong, there is often no pullback and therefore entering on the breakout of the micro channel is a reasonable trade.\nWhen the trend is not very strong, the breakout from the micro channel usually has a failure attempt within a bar or two. As is the case with all\nbreakouts, traders have to assess the strength of the breakout compared to the strength of the signal bar for the failed breakout. If the breakout is\nsignificantly stronger, especially if the underlying trend is strong, the reversal attempt will likely fail and lead to a breakout pullback setup that will\ngive traders a second chance to enter in the direction of the breakout. If the breakout is relatively weak, like a small trend bar with big tails, and the\nreversal bar is strong, especially if the context is likely to lead to a reversal (like a bull flag just below the top of a trading range), the reversal attempt\nwill probably succeed and traders should take the reversal entry. If the breakout and reversal are about equally strong, and there is no strong\nunderlying trend, traders will assess the strength of the next bar. For example, if there is a bull flag in the middle of a trading range, and the bull trend\nbar that breaks out of the flag is followed by an equally strong bear reversal bar, and the market trades below the low of that bar, traders will\nevaluate the appearance of that bear entry bar. If it becomes a bull reversal bar, they will assume that the market is just forming a pullback from the\nbreakout of the bull flag, and will buy above the high of the bar. If instead it is a strong bear trend bar, especially if it closes on its low and below the\nlow of the bull breakout bar, traders will see the pattern as a bear breakout and look to get short, if they did not already short below the bear\nreversal bar.\nIn the strictest sense, a pullback is a bar that moves against the trend enough to take out the prior bar's extreme. In a bull trend, a pullback is a\nmove where a bar extends at least one tick below the low of the prior bar. However, a broader definition is more useful, and any pause (including an\ninside bar, an opposite trend bar, or a doji bar) in a trend's momentum should be considered to be a pullback, even though there may be only\nsideways action and not an actual move backward. As even the strongest trend progresses, it at some point begins to give evidence of how deep\na pullback will be. Most commonly, it will be an area of two-sided trading. For example, after the spike in a spike and channel bull trend, the market\nhas a pause or pullback that creates the start of the channel. Once the trend channel ends and a sell-off (pullback) begins, it will usually test down to\nthe bottom of the channel. That is where bears started selling, and as the bull channel goes above their short entry price, they begin to worry. They\nand other bears sell more as the bull trend advances, but once the trend turns down into a pullback, those bears will be very happy to exit all of their\nentries at their earliest and lowest short entry price, which was the start of the channel. Once they are flat, they will not look to sell in that area,\nbecause they saw how far the market rallied after their earlier short trade. However, if they are still bearish, they will short again on a rally. If the rally\nends below the prior high, it will create a lower high and usually leads to a second leg down. If the bears are particularly strong, that lower high could\nbe the start of a new bear trend and not just a second pullback in an incipient trading range.\nThe same is true for a wedge at the end of a trend. If a bear trend forms a downward-sloping wedge, the market will try to correct to the top of the\nwedge where the earliest bulls began to buy. If the market can reach their earliest entry price, then they can exit that trade at breakeven and with a\nprofit on all of their lower entries, and they will likely not want to buy until the market falls again. They learned from their first trade that they bought at\ntoo high a price; they did not like riding through the open losses of their long positions as the market continued to fall and do not want to experience\nthat again. This time, they will wait for a pullback and hope the market forms a higher low or even a lower low. They expect that the original low of\nthe wedge will be support on any subsequent pullback and that buying near that level with a stop a little below that price gives them an entry with a\ndefined and limited risk, and they like that.\nThe tendency of the market in a trend to test the earliest area of two-sided trading allows perceptive traders to anticipate when a pullback might\nform and how far it will likely extend. They won't want to enter countertrend at the first sign of two-sided trading, but that two-sided trading tells them\nthat countertrend traders are beginning to take positions and at some point before too long the market will likely pull back to that price level.

One-legged and three-legged pullbacks are also common, as are small channels and triangles, but all pullbacks are\nrelatively brief, and traders will expect the trend to resume soon. Sometimes the legs are visible only on a smaller time frame chart, and other times\nthey are large and each leg breaks down into smaller legs, each of which also has two legs. Because traders expect the major trend to resume\nsoon, they will fade breakouts in a pullback. For example, if there is a strong bear trend that finally has a pullback with two legs up, there will usually\nbe far more bears than bulls as the market breaks out above the high of the first leg up. Even though the market is breaking out above a swing high\nin a bull trend, the bulls buying the breakout will usually be overwhelmed by bears who will short it, because they expect the breakout to fail and for\nthe bear trend to resume very soon. They will short on limit and market orders at and above the swing high. They see this breakout as a brief\nopportunity to reestablish shorts at a high price. Since 80 percent of attempts to reverse a trend will fail, the odds strongly favor the bears. This is\nespecially true for the first two-legged pullback in a strong trend.\nAny move that has two legs should be traded as if it is a pullback, even if it is with the trend. Sometimes the final leg in a trend is a two-legged,\nwith-trend move to a higher or lower high in a bull trend or a lower or higher low in a bear trend. For example, if there is a bull trend that has a sell-off\nthat falls through the bull trend line and this trend line breakout is followed by a two-legged pullback, that pullback simply tests the prior extreme and\ncan even exceed the old extreme. This means that the pullback from that trend line breakout can result in either a lower high or even a higher high\nand still be part of a transition into a new bear trend. Strictly speaking, the bear trend does not begin until after the final high, but that final high is\noften just a higher high pullback from the breakout below the bull trend line.\nWhat qualifies as two legs? You can create a line chart based on closes and often clearly see a two-legged move. If you are using bar or candle\ncharts, the easiest two-legged move to see is one in which there is a countertrend move, then a smaller with-trend move, and then a second\ncountertrend move (a textbook ABC pullback). So why does the move often reverse after the second leg? Look at a two-legged pullback in a bull\ntrend as an example. Bulls will buy the new low (the C leg), thinking that the second leg down will be the end of the trend. Also, short scalpers who\nwere looking for a two-legged correction will be buying back their shorts. Finally, aggressive bulls who bought the low of the first leg down (the A\nleg) will now be adding to their long positions on the move to a lower low. If all of these buyers overwhelm the new bears who shorted on the\nbreakout below the first leg down, a rally will ensue and it will usually test the old high at a minimum.\nHowever, oftentimes the two legs are clearly visible only on a smaller time frame chart and have to be inferred on the chart that you are viewing.\nSince it is easier to use a single chart for trading than to be checking multiple charts all day long, traders have an advantage if they can see the two\nlegs on the chart in front of them, if only by inference.\nIn a bull market, when there is a series of bull trend bars, a bear trend bar can be assumed to be the first leg of a pullback (the A leg) even if the\nlow of the bar is above the low of the prior bar. If you examined a smaller time frame chart, a countertrend leg would likely be evident. If the next bar\nhas a with-trend close but a high below that of the bar that ended the bull swing, then this is the B leg. If there is then a bear bar or a bar with a low\nbelow the low of the prior bar, this will create the second leg down (the C leg).\nThe more that has to be inferred, the less reliable is the pattern, since fewer traders will see it or have confidence in it. Traders will likely commit\nless capital and be quicker to exit.\nThere is an obvious point here. If the trend that is now pulling back ended in a climax or any significant trend reversal pattern, the trend has\nchanged and you should not be looking to enter pullbacks in the old trend. It is over, at least for maybe 10 bars or so and maybe for the rest of the\nday. So after a strong rally, if there is a wedge top or a lower low after a break of the bull trend line, you should now be looking for setups to short\nand not pullbacks in the old bull trend to buy. When it is not clear that there was a probable trend reversal, setups in both directions are likely to\nwork, at least for scalps. The more likely it is that a trend reversal has taken place, the more important it becomes to avoid trades in the old\ndirection, since it is now likely that there will be at least two legs in the new direction. Also, the amount of time and number of points in this move will\nusually be roughly proportional to the clarity of the reversal. When you have a great reversal setup, you should swing part or, rarely, even all of your\nposition.\nAll pullbacks begin with a reversal pattern of some type. It is usually strong enough to entice countertrend traders into taking a position against\nthe trend, but not strong enough to be a reliable countertrend setup. Since the setup and the pullback are not strong enough to change the direction\nof the always-in trade, traders should not be looking for a countertrend trade. Instead, they should be looking for a setup that signifies a possible\nend of the pullback and then enter in the direction of the trend. However, since the pullback began with a reversal, many traders would be overly\ncautious and talk themselves out of a great trade. You are never going to be 100 percent certain of any trade, but when you are reasonably\nconfident that a trade looks good, you have to trust the math, take the trade, and simply accept the reality that you will lose some of the time. That is\njust the nature of the business, and you cannot make a living as a trader unless you are willing to take losses. Remember, a major league baseball\nhitter who fails 70 percent of the time is considered to be a superstar and makes millions off that other 30 percent.\nWhen the market is in a weak trend, or in the early stages of transitioning from a trading range into a trend, it will sometimes have a flag, and then\na flag breakout, and then a pullback, and that pullback becomes another flag. The market will sometimes do this several times before a strong\nbreakout materializes.\nOne- and two-bar pauses are more difficult to trade than pullbacks that last many bars and actually pull back from the extreme. For example, if\nthere is a strong bull move in which the last bar was a small bar with a high just a tick or two below the prior bar's high and that bar was a large bull\ntrend bar and followed one or two other large bull trend bars, if you buy one tick above this bar, you are buying at the high of the day. Since lots of\ninstitutions fade every new high, there is a substantial risk that the move might reverse and hit your stop before your profit target is reached.\nHowever, if the trend is very strong, this is an important trade to take. Part of what makes this trade so difficult is that you have very little time to\nanalyze the strength of the trend and to look for possible trend channel line overshoots or other reasons why the trade might fail.\nAn even more difficult pause is a small doji with a high one tick above the high of the prior strong bull trend bar. Buying above the high of the doji\nis sometimes a good trade, but for most traders, it is too difficult to assess risk quickly enough and it is better to wait for a clearer setup. A reason\nagainst buying a pause bar breakout is if the last trend bar or two had fairly large tails, which indicates that countertrend traders were able to assert\nsome influence. Also, if the prior with-trend entry followed a larger pullback, like a high 2, you should be hesitant since each pullback usually gets\ndeeper, not shallower. However, if the market just broke out and had three bull trend bars with closes near their highs, then the chance of a\nsuccessful scalp when you buy above the pause bar that follows these bars is good. In general, these high 1 longs (or low 1 shorts in bear trends) in\nthe early stages of a strong bull trend are the only pause bars entries that most traders should consider. Also, remember that a pause bar after a\none-bar breakout is just as likely to be an entry in the opposite direction, since one-bar breakouts often fail, especially if they are countertrend.\nIf a pullback is small compared to the trend, it is usually safe to enter as soon as it ends.

For example, if there is a protracted bear channel in a strong bull trend, rather than buying the\nfirst reversal back up, it is safer to wait for a pullback from that breakout and buy the breakout pullback.\nAll bull pullbacks end for a reason, and that reason always is that the market has reached some kind of support. Sometimes they end quietly and\nother times with strong trend bars against the main trend and come close to reversing the trend. This is true of large pullbacks, and one- or two-bar\npullbacks from breakouts of small flags. Even the 1987 and 2009 stock market crashes ended at the monthly bull trend line, and were therefore just\npullbacks in a bull trend. Most end at a cluster of support levels, even though many traders may not see some or all of them. Some traders will buy a\npullback in a bull trend because they are focused on one support level, whether it is a bull trend line, a channel line along the bottom of the bull flag,\na prior high or low, some moving average, or any other type of support, and others will buy because they see a different support level in the same\narea. Once there are enough buyers coming in to overwhelm the bears, the trend will resume. The same is true of bear pullbacks. They always end\nat a cluster of resistance levels, although it is often easy to not see the resistance that the market is seeing. Once the market gets close to the key\nprice, the vacuum effect often dominates. For example, if buyers believe that the market is getting close to an important support level, they will often\nstep aside and wait for that level to be hit. This can result in a very strong bear spike, but once the support is hit, the bulls come in and buy\naggressively and relentlessly. The same is true for the bears who created the pullback. They, too, see the support level, and the closer the market\ngets to it, the more confident they are that the market will get there. The result is that they sell aggressively and relentlessly until the level is reached,\nand then they suddenly stop selling and quickly buy back their shorts. The pullback can end with a large bear trend bar that looks like it might flip the\nalways-in trade to short, but the follow-through selling over the next bars does not develop. Instead, the bull trend resumes, sometimes slowly at first.\nWith both the bulls and the bears buying, the reversal can be sharp and go a long way. The vacuum effect is always present, even during the most\ndramatic reversals, like the 1987 and the 2009 stock market crashes. In both instances, the market was in a free fall, but strongly reversed up once\nthe market fell a little below the monthly trend line. As dramatic as both crashes were, they were just examples of the vacuum effect at work.\nThis same behavior happens on a one- or two-bar pullback from the breakout of a flag. For example, if there is a low 2 bear flag at the moving\naverage in a strong bear trend and it triggers a short, the entry bar might be followed by a bull trend bar. This represents a failed breakout and could\nbe the start of a bull trend or a larger bear rally. However, it usually fails, and when a failure fails, it becomes a pullback in the larger trend. Here, it\nbecomes a breakout pullback short setup. Traders will expect it to fail, and aggressive bears will short on its close and just below and above its\nhigh. More conservative traders will wait for confirmation that this bear trend bar is just a pullback from the breakout of the bear flag. They will short\non a stop below the low of the bear bar, or the next bar or two, if the pullback continues a little longer.\nSince a pullback is only a pause in a trend and not a reversal, once you identify what you believe is a pullback, you believe that the trend will\nresume and there will be a test of the trend's extreme. For example, if there is a bull trend and then the market sells off for several bars and if you\nsee that sell-off as a buying opportunity, then you believe that it is just a pullback in the bull trend. You are expecting a test of the bull trend's high. It is\nimportant to note that the test does not have to reach a new high. Yes, it is often a higher high, but it can be a double top or a lower high. After the\ntest, you will then decide whether the bull trend is intact or has transitioned into a trading range or even a bear trend.\nPullbacks are often strong spikes that make traders wonder if the trend has reversed. For example, in a bull trend, there might be a large bear\ntrend bar or two that break below the moving average and maybe several ticks below a trading range. Traders will then wonder if the always-in\ndirection is in the process of flipping to down. What they need to see is follow-through selling in the form of maybe just one more bear trend bar.\nEveryone will watch that next bar closely. If it is a large bear trend bar, most traders will believe that the reversal has been confirmed and will start\nshorting at the market and on pullbacks. If the bar instead has a bull close, they will suspect that the reversal attempt has failed and that the sell-off\nis just a brief, but sharp, markdown in price and therefore a buying opportunity. Beginning traders see the strong bear spike and ignore the strong\nbull trend in which it is occurring. They sell the close of the bear trend bar, below its low, any small bounce over the next few bars, and below any low\n1 or low 2 sell setup. Smart bulls are taking the opposite side of those trades because they understand what is happening.\nThe market is always trying to reverse, but 80 percent of those reversal attempts fail and become bull flags. At the time the reversal attempt is\noccurring, the two or three bear bars can be very persuasive, but without follow-through selling, the bulls see the sell-off as a great opportunity to get\nlong again near the low of a brief sell climax. Experienced bulls and bears wait for these strong trend bars and sometimes step aside until one\nforms. Then they come into the market and buy because they view it as the climactic end of the selling. The bears buy back their shorts and the bulls\nreestablish their longs. This is the opposite of what happens at the end of a trend when the strong traders are waiting for one large trend bar. For\nexample, in a strong bear trend near a support area, there will often be a late breakout in the form of an unusually large bear trend bar. Both the\nbulls and the bears stopped buying until they saw it form. At that point, both buy the sell climax, because the bears see it as a great price to take\nprofits on their shorts and the bulls see it as a brief opportunity to buy at a very low price.\nIf traders see what they believe is just a pullback, then they believe that the trend is still intact. When they are evaluating the trader's equation, the\nprobability is never known with certainty, but since they are making a trade in the direction of the trend, they can assume that the directional\nprobability of an equidistant move is 60 percent. It might be higher but it is unlikely to be much lower. Otherwise, they would have concluded that the\npullback had lasted so long that it had lost its predictive value and had become an ordinary trading range, which has about an equal probability of\nthe eventual breakout being up or down. Once they determine their risk, they can then set a profit target that is at least as large as the risk and\nreasonably assume that they have about a 60 percent chance or better of being successful. For example, if they are buying a breakout of a bull flag\nin Goldman Sachs (GS) and their protective stop is below the bull flag, about 50 cents below their entry, they can assume that they have at least a\n60 percent chance of making at least a 50 cent profit on their long. Their profit target might be a test of the bull high. If it is and that high is $2.00\nabove their entry, they likely still have about a 60 percent chance of success, but now their potential reward is four times their risk, and this creates\na very favorable result from the trader's equation.\nOnce you believe that the market has reversed, it usually will pull back to test the prior trend's extreme before the new trend unfolds. For example,\nassume that there is a bear trend and that the prior pullback was strong enough to break above the bear trend line and now the market is reversing\nup from a lower low test of the bear trend's bottom. This is a possible trend reversal into a bull trend. If that first leg up is in the form of a strong\nspike, you then believe that the odds of a reversal are now even greater. The pullback from that first strong leg up will usually result in a higher low,\nbut it can also result in a double bottom with the bear's low or even a lower low. How can it be that you believe that the trend has reversed up into a\nbull trend, yet the market has now fallen to a lower low? A lower low is one of the hallmarks of a bear trend, and it can never be a part of a bull trend.\nYes, that is the conventional wisdom, but you stand to make more money as a trader if you use broader definitions. You might stop yourself out of\nyour long if the market falls below the old bear low, but you might still believe that the bulls really control the market. That spike up was a breakout of\nthe old bear trend and converted the market into a bull trend. It does not matter if the pullback from the breakout falls below the bear low. Suppose\nthe market stopped exactly at the old low instead of going one tick lower. Do you really think that is of major importance? Sometimes it is but\nusually close is close enough.

For example, if there is a protracted bear channel in a strong bull trend, rather than buying the first reversal back up, it is safer to wait for a pullback from that breakout and buy the breakout pullback.\nAll bull pullbacks end for a reason, and that reason always is that the market has reached some kind of support. Sometimes they end quietly and other times with strong trend bars against the main trend and come close to reversing the trend. This is true of large pullbacks, and one- or two-bar pullbacks from breakouts of small flags. Even the 1987 and 2009 stock market crashes ended at the monthly bull trend line, and were therefore just pullbacks in a bull trend. Most end at a cluster of support levels, even though many traders may not see some or all of them. Some traders will buy a pullback in a bull trend because they are focused on one support level, whether it is a bull trend line, a channel line along the bottom of the bull flag, a prior high or low, some moving average, or any other type of support, and others will buy because they see a different support level in the same area. Once there are enough buyers coming in to overwhelm the bears, the trend will resume. The same is true of bear pullbacks. They always end at a cluster of resistance levels, although it is often easy to not see the resistance that the market is seeing. Once the market gets close to the key price, the vacuum effect often dominates. For example, if buyers believe that the market is getting close to an important support level, they will often step aside and wait for that level to be hit. This can result in a very strong bear spike, but once the support is hit, the bulls come in and buy aggressively and relentlessly. The same is true for the bears who created the pullback. They, too, see the support level, and the closer the market gets to it, the more confident they are that the market will get there. The result is that they sell aggressively and relentlessly until the level is reached, and then they suddenly stop selling and quickly buy back their shorts. The pullback can end with a large bear trend bar that looks like it might flip the always-in trade to short, but the follow-through selling over the next bars does not develop. Instead, the bull trend resumes, sometimes slowly at first.\nWith both the bulls and the bears buying, the reversal can be sharp and go a long way. The vacuum effect is always present, even during the most dramatic reversals, like the 1987 and the 2009 stock market crashes. In both instances, the market was in a free fall, but strongly reversed up once the market fell a little below the monthly trend line. As dramatic as both crashes were, they were just examples of the vacuum effect at work.\nThis same behavior happens on a one- or two-bar pullback from the breakout of a flag. For example, if there is a low 2 bear flag at the moving average in a strong bear trend and it triggers a short, the entry bar might be followed by a bull trend bar. This represents a failed breakout and could be the start of a bull trend or a larger bear rally. However, it usually fails, and when a failure fails, it becomes a pullback in the larger trend. Here, it becomes a breakout pullback short setup. Traders will expect it to fail, and aggressive bears will short on its close and just below and above its high. More conservative traders will wait for confirmation that this bear trend bar is just a pullback from the breakout of the bear flag. They will short on a stop below the low of the bear bar, or the next bar or two, if the pullback continues a little longer.\nSince a pullback is only a pause in a trend and not a reversal, once you identify what you believe is a pullback, you believe that the trend will resume and there will be a test of the trend's extreme. For example, if there is a bull trend and then the market sells off for several bars and if you see that sell-off as a buying opportunity, then you believe that it is just a pullback in the bull trend. You are expecting a test of the bull trend's high. It is important to note that the test does not have to reach a new high. Yes, it is often a higher high, but it can be a double top or a lower high. After the test, you will then decide whether the bull trend is intact or has transitioned into a trading range or even a bear trend.\nPullbacks are often strong spikes that make traders wonder if the trend has reversed. For example, in a bull trend, there might be a large bear trend bar or two that break below the moving average and maybe several ticks below a trading range. Traders will then wonder if the always-in direction is in the process of flipping to down. What they need to see is follow-through selling in the form of maybe just one more bear trend bar.\nEveryone will watch that next bar closely. If it is a large bear trend bar, most traders will believe that the reversal has been confirmed and will start shorting at the market and on pullbacks. If the bar instead has a bull close, they will suspect that the reversal attempt has failed and that the sell-off is just a brief, but sharp, markdown in price and therefore a buying opportunity. Beginning traders see the strong bear spike and ignore the strong bull trend in which it is occurring. They sell the close of the bear trend bar, below its low, any small bounce over the next few bars, and below any low 1 or low 2 sell setup. Smart bulls are taking the opposite side of those trades because they understand what is happening.\nThe market is always trying to reverse, but 80 percent of those reversal attempts fail and become bull flags. At the time the reversal attempt is occurring, the two or three bear bars can be very persuasive, but without follow-through selling, the bulls see the sell-off as a great opportunity to get long again near the low of a brief sell climax. Experienced bulls and bears wait for these strong trend bars and sometimes step aside until one forms. Then they come into the market and buy because they view it as the climactic end of the selling. The bears buy back their shorts and the bulls reestablish their longs. This is the opposite of what happens at the end of a trend when the strong traders are waiting for one large trend bar. For example, in a strong bear trend near a support area, there will often be a late breakout in the form of an unusually large bear trend bar. Both the bulls and the bears stopped buying until they saw it form. At that point, both buy the sell climax, because the bears see it as a great price to take profits on their shorts and the bulls see it as a brief opportunity to buy at a very low price.\nIf traders see what they believe is just a pullback, then they believe that the trend is still intact. When they are evaluating the trader's equation, the probability is never known with certainty, but since they are making a trade in the direction of the trend, they can assume that the directional probability of an equidistant move is 60 percent. It might be higher but it is unlikely to be much lower. Otherwise, they would have concluded that the pullback had lasted so long that it had lost its predictive value and had become an ordinary trading range, which has about an equal probability of the eventual breakout being up or down. Once they determine their risk, they can then set a profit target that is at least as large as the risk and reasonably assume that they have about a 60 percent chance or better of being successful. For example, if they are buying a breakout of a bull flag in Goldman Sachs (GS) and their protective stop is below the bull flag, about 50 cents below their entry, they can assume that they have at least a 60 percent chance of making at least a 50 cent profit on their long. Their profit target might be a test of the bull high. If it is and that high is $2.00 above their entry, they likely still have about a 60 percent chance of success, but now their potential reward is four times their risk, and this creates a very favorable result from the trader's equation.\nOnce you believe that the market has reversed, it usually will pull back to test the prior trend's extreme before the new trend unfolds. For example, assume that there is a bear trend and that the prior pullback was strong enough to break above the bear trend line and now the market is reversing up from a lower low test of the bear trend's bottom. This is a possible trend reversal into a bull trend. If that first leg up is in the form of a strong spike, you then believe that the odds of a reversal are now even greater. The pullback from that first strong leg up will usually result in a higher low, but it can also result in a double bottom with the bear's low or even a lower low.

However, it was still the breakout that showed that the bulls took control over the market, and it really does\nnot matter that the pullback fell to a lower low and that the bears briefly regained control. All that matters is that the bulls are in control and will likely\nbe so for many bars, so you need to be looking to buy pullbacks, even that first pullback to the lower low.\nPullbacks to lower lows in bull trends or higher highs in bear trends are common in the small legs that take place on every chart. For example,\nassume that there is a bear trend and then there is a tight channel rally to the moving average that lasts about eight bars. Since the channel is tight,\nit is strong and this means that the first bear breakout will likely fail, even though it is in the direction of the trend. Traders usually wait for a pullback\nback up before looking to short. However, that pullback will often be in the form of a higher high, creating an ABC pullback in the bear trend. They\nwill short below the low of the prior bar, confident that a low 2 short at the moving average is a great trade in a strong bear trend. Many traders do\nnot think of this ABC as a bear breakout (the B leg is the breakout below the channel that constitutes the A leg) and then a breakout pullback to a\nhigher high (the C leg), but that is what it actually is, if you think about it.\nThere is a special type of higher high or lower low pullback that is common in major trend reversals, which are discussed in book 3. For example,\nif there is a bull trend that has a strong move down below the bull trend line, and then a weak rally (for example, a wedge) to a new high, this higher\nhigh is sometimes the start of a new bear trend. If the trend then reverses down into a bear trend, this weak rally to the higher high is simply a\npullback from the bear spike that broke the bull trend line. That bear spike was the actual start of the bear trend, even though the pullback from the\nspike rallied to above the top of the bear spike and created a new high in the bull trend. After the bear trend has gone on for 20 or more bars, most\ntraders will look back at the higher high and see it as the start of the bear trend, and that is a reasonable conclusion. However, as the trend was\nforming, astute traders were wondering if the market had reversed into a bear trend, and they did not care if the rally up from the bear spike tested\nthe bull high as a lower high, a double top, or a higher high. From a strictly technical perspective, the trend began once the bears took control of the\nmarket during the bear spike and not with the test of the bull high. The confirmation of the trend reversal came once the market sold off strongly from\nthe higher high. Although the higher high is actually simply a pullback from the bear spike, it does not matter which of the two highs you think is the\nstart of the bear trend, because you would trade the market the same way and look to short below the higher high. The same is true when a bear\ntrend reverses into a bull trend from a lower low after a strong rally breaks above the bear trend line. The bulls took control of the market on the\nspike that broke above the bull trend line, but most traders would say that the new bull began with the lower low. However, that lower low was simply\na pullback from the strong bull spike.\nAny trend that covers a lot of points in very few bars, meaning that there is some combination of large bars and bars that overlap each other only\nminimally, will eventually have a pullback. These trends have such strong momentum that the odds favor resumption of the trend after the pullback\nand then a test of the trend's extreme. Usually the extreme will be exceeded, as long as the pullback does not turn into a new trend in the opposite\ndirection and extend beyond the start of the original trend. In general, the odds that a pullback will get back to the prior trend's extreme fall\nsubstantially if the pullback retraces 75 percent or more. For a pullback in a bear trend, at that point, a trader is better off thinking of the pullback as\na new bull trend rather than a pullback in an old bear trend.\nThe most frustrating thing about waiting for a pullback is that sometimes it never seems to come. For example, when there is a rally and you are\nnow confident that it would be smart to buy a pullback, the market goes up bar after bar and does not pull back until it has gone so far that now you\nthink it might reverse instead of pulling back. Why is that? Every bull trend is created by buy programs that use every imaginable algorithm, and\nstrong trends occur when many firms are running programs in the same direction. Once you are confident that the bull trend is strong, so is\neveryone else. Experienced traders understand what is going on, and they realize that any pullback will almost certainly be bought and it will be\nfollowed by a new high. Because of that, instead of waiting for a pullback, they are doing just what the institutions are doing. They are buying at the\nmarket and on tiny pullbacks that are not evident on the chart in front of them. Maybe they are buying on a one- or two-tick pullback. The programs\nwill keep buying because the probability is that a trend will continue until it reaches some technical level. At that point, the math will favor a reversal.\nIn other words, the math overshot neutrality and now favors a reversal, and because it does, the firms will aggressively trade in the opposite\ndirection and the new trend will continue until once again it overshoots neutrality and the odds again favor a move in the opposite direction.\nFor example, if AAPL is up $4.00 at $280 and it has gone up for seven straight bars on the 5 minute chart, it will probably go up for the eighth bar\nand even more. Traders are willing to buy at $280 because they understand the logic of the directional probability of an equidistant move. Since\nthey are confident that at some point soon the market will be higher than it is right now and they are not confident that it will be lower soon, they buy\nat the market and on small dips. Although they may not think in terms of directional probability, all trend trading is based on it. When AAPL is\ntrending up strongly, they would rather buy at $280 because they believe that the market will reach $281 before it falls back to $279. They also likely\nbelieve that it will reach $282 and maybe $283 before it falls back one dollar. They may not think of this in terms of math and the exact probability is\nnever certain, but in this situation, there is probably about a 70 percent chance that AAPL will go two or three dollars higher before it pulls back one\ndollar. That means that if you take this trade 10 times, you will make two dollars in seven cases for $14 profit and you will lose one dollar three\ntimes. Your net profit is $11, or more than a dollar per trade.\nIf instead they wait for the $1.00 pullback, it might not come until AAPL is at $283. They then could buy it at $282, but that is two dollars worse\nthan what they could have paid earlier if they just bought at the market.\nIf after they bought at $280, AAPL fell to $279, many traders would buy more because they believe that the odds are probably better than 70\npercent that it would rally to a new high and they could get out of their first long at breakeven and have a dollar profit on their lower entry.\nThis is important for traders who are waiting to enter on pullbacks. When the trend is strong, it is often better to enter at the market than to wait for\na pullback.\nFigure PIII.1 Pullbacks Begin with Reversals\n", "text_clean": "market fell below the bottom of the spike.

Once they saw that it had a\nbear body and it closed below the low of the prior bar, they could short below the low of the bar 16 outside down bar, which is a higher-probability\nshort since that bear close gave them additional confirmation that the bears were strong.\nThe sell-off down to bar 17 was in a tight channel and there were seven bars without a bull close. This is too strong to buy the first attempt to\nbreak out to the upside. The breakout pullback was to a lower low at bar 20, and the buy setup was an ii (inside-inside) pattern.\nThe rally to bar 21 was in a steep bull channel with seven bars with higher lows and highs. This is too strong to short the first breakout below the\nbull channel. The breakout pullback to bar 23 formed a double top with the bar 21 channel high. The following bar was a strong bear inside bar,\nwhich was a good signal bar for the breakout pullback short.\nThe move down to bar 5 was a bull flag, and it was followed by a breakout and then a pullback to bar 8, which was at the bottom of another bull\nflag. It then broke out to bar 9 and formed another pullback to bar 12, which was another bull flag buy setup. The market often has breakouts that\nlead to pullbacks that become flags. This usually happens in weaker trends and in trading ranges, as it did here.\nAlthough bars 5 and 12 were strong bear trend bars and attempts to flip the always-in position to short, they did what most such attempts do—\nthey failed. The bears needed one more strong bear trend bar before they could convince traders that the short-term trend was down and lower\nprices were likely over the next several bars. When it became clear that the bulls were buying relentlessly and the bears could not push the market\ndown, they bought back their shorts. Their buying, combined with the continued buying by the bulls who saw the strong bear trend bars as great\nopportunities to buy at a low price, resulted in the resumption of the bull trend.

However, each pullback tends to be greater as the countertrend\ntraders become more willing to take positions and the with-trend traders become quicker to take profits. Countertrend traders start to take control\nat new extremes. For example, in a bull trend, traders will start to be able to make profitable trades by shorting reversals from new highs, and with-\ntrend traders will begin to lose when they buy breakouts to new highs. At some point, the countertrend traders will overwhelm the with-trend traders\nand the trend will reverse.\nThe first minor pullback in a strong trend is a one- or two-bar pullback, which almost always is followed by a new extreme. For example, if there is\na bull spike that goes on for four bars and there is little overlap between the bars and the tails are small, the trend is strong. If the next bar has a low\nbelow the low of the prior bar, this is the first pullback in this bull trend. Traders will place a buy stop above its high, since they expect at least one\nmore push up. If their order is filled, this is a high 1 long entry, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 17 in this book. Aggressive traders will buy on\na limit order below the low of the prior bar, expecting the pullback to be brief and wanting to get in at a lower price than the traders who are waiting\nto buy on a stop above the pullback bar or bars. The next pullback might be three to five bars long and will likely break a minor trend line and then\nbe followed by another new extreme. If this pullback has two small legs, then the buy entry is a high 2 long (a two-legged pullback, commonly called\nan ABC pullback). Although this second pullback can be a high 2 setup, if the trend is very strong, it can be another high 1 (a one-legged pullback).\nIf the market went from one or two high 1 entries and then a high 2 entry, and it appeared to be setting up another high 1, it is wise to wait. After a\nseries of winning trades, you should be suspicious of renewed strength without first seeing a larger pullback, since this strength might be a trap\nsetting up (like a final flag, discussed in book 3). It is better to wait for more price action and miss a possible trap than to feel invincible and fearless\nbecause you fooled yourself into believing that you are playing with someone else's money. If you trade, it will likely become someone else's money.\nThe opposite is true in a strong bear trend, where the first pullback is usually a brief one- or two-bar low 1 short entry and later pullbacks have\nmore bars and more legs. For example, an ABC pullback has two legs and sets up a low 2 short entry.\nIf the trend is strong, it might stay away from the moving average for two hours or more, but once it hits the moving average, it will likely form\nanother with-trend setup that will lead to another new extreme, or at least a test of the old extreme. In a pullback to the moving average in a bull\ntrend, many traders believe that the price is at a good enough discount for them to buy. The bears who shorted above will buy back their shorts to\ntake profits; the bulls who took profits higher will look to buy again; and the traders who had been on the sidelines, waiting for lower prices, will see\nthe moving average as support and a sufficient discount for them to initiate new longs. If the market cannot move above the moving average after\nabout 10 to 20 bars, it is probably because traders want more of a discount before aggressively buying. The price is not low enough yet to attract\nsufficient buyers to lift the market. The result is that the market will have to fall further before enough buyers return to lift the market up to test the old\nhighs. This same process happens at all support levels.\nIf a pullback goes beyond the moving average, it will have the first moving average gap bar setup (for example, in a strong bull trend, there is\nfinally a pullback that has a bar with a high below the exponential moving average). This is usually followed by a test of the extreme and likely a new\nextreme. Eventually, there will be a countertrend move that will break a major trend line, and it often is the pullback to the first moving average gap\nbar. It will be followed by a test of the extreme, which may undershoot (higher low in a bear trend or lower high in a bull trend) or overshoot (lower\nlow in a bear trend or higher high in a bull trend) the old extreme. This is then usually followed by at least a two-legged countertrend move, if not a\ntrend reversal. Each pullback prior to the reversal is a with-trend entry, because each is a first pullback of one type or another (bar, minor trend line,\nmoving average, moving average gap, or major trend line), and any type of first pullback is usually followed by at least a test of the extreme and\nusually a new extreme until after the major trend line is broken.\nAlthough it is not worth the effort to pay attention to higher time frame charts when trading on a 5 minute chart, it is likely that the larger 5 minute\npullbacks end at 15, 30, or 60 minute, or even daily, weekly, or monthly chart points of significance like exponential moving averages (EMAs),\nbreakout points, and trend lines. Also, there is often a tendency for the first pullback to the 15 minute moving average to be followed by a test of the\ntrend extreme, and then a pullback to the 30 or 60 minute moving average, which would likely be followed by another test of the extreme. With\nhigher time frame points of significance occurring relatively infrequently, spending time looking for tests of those points will be a distraction and\ncause traders to miss too many 5 minute signals.\nIf a trend is strong and you have made several profitable trades but there are now several sideways bars, be cautious about further entries\nbecause this is effectively a trading range. In a bull trend, you can buy if there is a setup near the low of the range, but be careful buying a breakout\nof the high of the trading range, because bears might be willing to sell a new high and bulls might be beginning to take profits at the high.\nThe same is true in a bear flag after a protracted down move. Sideways bars mean that both buyers and sellers are active, so you do not want to\nbe shorting on a breakout of the low of the flag. However, if there is a short setup near the top of the flag, your risk is small and the trade is worth\ntaking.\nFigure 11.1 Subsequent Pullbacks Tend to Get Larger\n", "text_clean": "The sell-off to the new low has two or more pullbacks, each lasting two or three bars and having more prominent bull bodies.\nThere is a larger two-legged pullback, lasting more than 10 bars, with the second leg up reaching above a prominent lower high, forming a higher high.\nThe market enters a trading range, and the bull and bear bars are about equally prominent.\nThe market breaks below the trading range and comes back into the trading range, forming a larger trading range.\nMost of the first pullbacks are minor and are still part of the larger trend's first leg.

Eventually, there will be a countertrend move that will break a major trend line, and it often is the pullback to the first moving average gap bar. It will be followed by a test of the extreme, which may undershoot (higher low in a bear trend or lower high in a bull trend) or overshoot (lower low in a bear trend or higher high in a bull trend) the old extreme. This is then usually followed by at least a two-legged countertrend move, if not a trend reversal. Each pullback prior to the reversal is a with-trend entry, because each is a first pullback of one type or another (bar, minor trend line, moving average, moving average gap, or major trend line), and any type of first pullback is usually followed by at least a test of the extreme and usually a new extreme until after the major trend line is broken.\nAlthough it is not worth the effort to pay attention to higher time frame charts when trading on a 5 minute chart, it is likely that the larger 5 minute pullbacks end at 15, 30, or 60 minute, or even daily, weekly, or monthly chart points of significance like exponential moving averages (EMAs), breakout points, and trend lines.

In a bull trend, you can buy if there is a setup near the low of the range, but be careful buying a breakout of the high of the trading range, because bears might be willing to sell a new high and bulls might be beginning to take profits at the high.\nThe same is true in a bear flag after a protracted down move. Sideways bars mean that both buyers and sellers are active, so you do not want to be shorting on a breakout of the low of the flag. However, if there is a short setup near the top of the flag, your risk is small and the trade is worth taking.\nFigure 11.1 Subsequent Pullbacks Tend to Get Larger", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["The sell-off to the new low has two or more pullbacks, each lasting two or three bars and having more prominent bull bodies.", "There is a larger two-legged pullback, lasting more than 10 bars, with the second leg up reaching above a prominent lower high, forming", "a higher high.", "The market enters a trading range, and the bull and bear bars are about equally prominent.", "The market breaks below the trading range and comes back into the trading range, forming a larger trading range.", "Most of the first pullbacks are minor and are still part of the larger trend's first leg.

Since a pullback in a bull trend is a small bear trend,\nthis small bear trend can end in a double bottom. Because it is a pullback in a bull trend, it is a bull flag and can be referred to as a double bottom\nbull flag. It is two legs down in a bull trend, and therefore a high 2 buy setup. It is a particularly reliable type of high 2 buy setup, so I generally refer to\nit as a double bottom to distinguish it from other high 2 patterns. Likewise, a pullback in a bear trend is a bear flag and it is a small bull trend, and\nthat small bull trend can end with a double top. If it does, that double top is a double top bear flag.\nIn a bull trend, bulls often trail their protective stops below the most recent higher low, because they want the trend to continue to make higher\nlows and higher highs. A double bottom bull flag is, in part, due to bulls defending their trailing stops below the most recent swing low. If the market\nfalls below the most recent swing low, traders will see the bull trend as weaker, and possibly over. That would be a lower low, and they would be\nconcerned that it might be followed by a lower high instead of a new high. If so, the market might be forming a two-legged correction (a large high 2\nbuy setup), or even a trend reversal. Because of this, if the bulls have a lot of conviction in the trend, they will buy heavily at and just above the most\nrecent swing low, creating a double bottom bull flag. The opposite is true in a bear trend, where the bears want the market to keep forming lower\nhighs and lows. Many will trail their protective stops just above the most recent lower high, and strong bears often short aggressively on any rally up\nto that most recent lower high. This can result in a double top bear flag.\nAny pullback in a bull or bear trend can turn into either a double bottom bull flag or a double top bear flag. Sometimes both are present within the\nsame pullback, and then this small trading range puts the market in breakout mode. If the market breaks to the upside, traders will see the pattern\nas a double bottom bull flag, and if it breaks to the downside, they will see it as a double top bear flag. If there is significant momentum up or down\nbefore the pattern, that momentum increases the odds that the trading range will just be a continuation pattern. For example, if there was a strong\nmove up just before the trading range, an upside breakout is more likely and traders should look to buy the reversal up from a double bottom at the\nbottom of the range. If there is then an upside breakout, traders will see the pattern as a double bottom bull flag. If instead the market was in a bear\nspike just before the trading range, traders should look to sell the reversal down from a double top within the pattern and expect a downside\nbreakout. If that happens, traders will see the trading range as a double top bear flag.\nWhen there is a bull trend and then a two-legged pullback where either of the down legs is a bear spike, which might appear unremarkable, the\nbears will want the market to stay below the lower high that followed the first leg down. They will short in an attempt to reverse the trend into a bear\ntrend. The bulls always want the opposite because trading is a zero-sum game—what's good for the bears is bad for the bulls and vice versa. The\nrally up from the second leg down often will stall at or just below the lower high. The bulls want the rally to go above the lower high, run the protective\nstops of the bears, and then reach a new high. The bears will short aggressively to keep that from happening and are often willing to short heavily at\na tick or two below the lower high and at the lower high. This is why the rally often goes all the way up to the lower high before the market turns\ndown. It is the final defense of the bears, and they will be at their absolute strongest at the lower high. If the bears win and the market turns down,\nthis creates a double top bear flag, and a bear channel often follows. After the lower high and the double top test of the lower high, the bears next\nwant a lower low and then a series of lower highs and lows.\nWhether or not the rally up from the second leg down stalls at the lower high, above it, or below it, if the market then sells off again, it can form a\ndouble bottom with the bottom of the pullback. If there is a reasonable buy setup, traders will buy it, looking for this double bottom to be a bull flag\nthat will be followed by a new high in the bull trend. Many bulls who bought at the bottom of the two legs down will have their protective stops just\nbelow the pullback. If the market starts up and comes back down again, the bulls will buy aggressively at a tick or two above the bottom of the first\nleg down in an attempt to turn the market up. They don't want the market to create a lower low after the lower high, because this is a sign of strength\nby the bears and it would increase the chances that the market would trade either further down or sideways instead of up. If they succeed, they\nmight be able to resume a bull trend. If the market falls a tick or two below the bottom of that first leg down, it might run the protective stops of the\nbulls and then break out into a measured move down.\nTwo-legged pullbacks are common in any trend, and they are often horizontal with both legs ending around the same price. Sometimes the\npullback can last for dozens of bars before the trend resumes. The sideways move often begins and ends with small legs that have extremes that\nare very close in price (the second spike can slightly overshoot or undershoot the first one). The trend resumption from each of the legs is an\nattempt to extend the trend. For example, if there is a bear trend and then a pullback, and then the market sells off again, the bears are pushing for\na lower low and an extension of the bear trend. However, if instead the market finds more buyers than sellers above the bear low and forms a\nhigher low, the bears have failed to drive the market down to a new low. If this second leg up does not result in a new bull trend and the bears are\nable to regain control and create a low 2 short entry, they will drive the market down again in an attempt to have the market break out to a new low. If\nagain the bulls overwhelm the bears around the same price as they did earlier, the bears will have failed twice at the same price level. When\nthe market fails twice in an attempt to do something, it usually then tries to do the opposite. Those two pushes down that ended around the same\nprice, just above the bear low, create a double bottom bull flag. It is a higher low that has two bottoms instead of one. It is a type of failed low 2, and\nis a reliable buy signal in this situation.\nSimilarly, if there is a sell-off in a bull trend but then the bulls regain control of the market and try to rally it up beyond the old high and fail, then the\nbears were successful in driving the market down again and they created a lower high. If the bulls once again take control and once more push the\nmarket up as they try for a new bull high, and again the bears overwhelm them around the same price as they did earlier, there will be a double top.\nSince the market twice tried to break out to a new bull high and failed, it will likely try to go in the opposite direction. There aren't enough bulls near\nthe old high to create a new high, so the market will have to go lower to find more bulls. Instead of being a successful ABC pullback (a high 2 buy\nsetup) in the bull trend, the pullback failed to find enough bulls to create a new high and the result was a lower high, which was made of a double\ntop.\nA common form of this occurs in spike and channel trends. For example, if there is a spike up and then a pullback that leads to a bull channel, the\nmarket usually eventually corrects down to test the bottom of the channel, where it tries to turn up again. This test of the bottom of the channel\ncreates a double bottom with the bottom of the channel, which might have been dozens of bars earlier, and since it is in a bull trend (a spike and\nchannel bull trend), it is a double bottom bull flag.\n", "text_clean": "Chapter 12\nDouble Top Bear Flags and Double Bottom Bull Flags A bull trend often ends with a double top, and a bear trend often ends with a double bottom.

It is a type of failed low 2, and is a reliable buy signal in this situation.\nSimilarly, if there is a sell-off in a bull trend but then the bulls regain control of the market and try to rally it up beyond the old high and fail, then the bears were successful in driving the market down again and they created a lower high. If the bulls once again take control and once more push the market up as they try for a new bull high, and again the bears overwhelm them around the same price as they did earlier, there will be a double top.\nSince the market twice tried to break out to a new bull high and failed, it will likely try to go in the opposite direction. There aren't enough bulls near the old high to create a new high, so the market will have to go lower to find more bulls. Instead of being a successful ABC pullback (a high 2 buy setup) in the bull trend, the pullback failed to find enough bulls to create a new high and the result was a lower high, which was made of a double top.\nA common form of this occurs in spike and channel trends. For example, if there is a spike up and then a pullback that leads to a bull channel, the market usually eventually corrects down to test the bottom of the channel, where it tries to turn up again. This test of the bottom of the channel creates a double bottom with the bottom of the channel, which might have been dozens of bars earlier, and since it is in a bull trend (a spike and channel bull trend), it is a double bottom bull flag.", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["Chapter 12", "Double Top Bear Flags and Double Bottom Bull Flags", "A bull trend often ends with a double top, and a bear trend often ends with a double bottom.

That would create a failed head and shoulders top, and the minimum objective to the\nupside would be a measured move up from the bar 6 low to the bar 7 high.\nThe rally up to bar 2 was strong enough for most traders to believe that the market would soon be higher (they believed that the market had\nflipped to always-in long). This made traders hesitant to short the double top bear flag that formed a couple of weeks later. However, because they\nwere looking for higher prices after the possible bottom at bar 1 and the strong rally to bar 2, they bought the bar 4 double bottom bull flag.\nFigure 12.5 Failed Double Bottom\nIn Figure 12.5, the market formed a five-bar bear spike that was followed by a two-bar bull spike at bar 2.\nBar 4 attempted to form a double bottom bull flag with the bar before bar 3 and with the bull entry bar after bar 2. Bars 5 and 6 also tried to\ncomplete the base. Often the market breaks below the first bottom by a tick or so, trapping bulls out and bears in, as was the case at bar 5. Bar 6\nwas an exact test of the bar 5 false breakout of the bar 4 low, and was an outside up entry bar or signal bar for a double bottom bull flag. It led to the\nbar 7 breakout of the top of the range, which quickly failed in a two-bar reversal.\nThe market made a second one-tick breakout below the trading range at bar 8. It is important to realize that if the market falls below that low by\neven a tick, traders will start to assume that the bears are taking control. They will see this as effectively a failed attempt at a wedge bottom, where\nbar 4 was the first push down, the one-tick breakout at bar 5 was the second, and the next one-tick breakout at bar 8 was the third. Once the market\nfell below bar 8, the target was an approximate measured move down using either the height of the wedge (the bar 6 low to the bar 3 high) or the\nheight of the trading range (the bar 8 low to the bar 7 high). This type of three-push pattern can take place in any market, and the downside\nbreakouts don't have to be exactly one tick. For example, in a stock that is trading around $200, the breakouts that are comparable to bars 5 and 8\nin this chart might be 20 cents or more.\nSome traders would see the reversal up from bar 6 as a failed breakout of the bottom of the range, and then bar 7 as a failed breakout of the top\nof the range. Many would short below the two-bar reversal at the top, where bar 7 was the first bar, because they know that trading ranges often\nhave strong breakouts that quickly fail. Some would exit at breakeven on the rally to bar 9 but then would have taken the second entry short below\nthe lower high at bar 9.\nOther traders would trade the market in breakout mode, looking to sell on a stop below bar 6 and buy on a stop above bar 7. There were trapped\nbears on the failed downside breakout and then trapped bulls on the failed upside breakout, and when there are trapped bulls and bears, the next\nbreakout usually results in a decent swing. Although the rally to bar 9 was strong, the bears would short below it because they would see it as a\npullback from the bar 8 breakout.\nCompare this to Figure 11.1 in Chapter 11, where there was a similar trading range after an early strong bear spike, but the potential trend\nresumption bear day failed and the market reversed up.\nFigure 12.6 Double Bottom Bull Flag and a Measured Move Up\nA double bottom followed by a sharp move off the second low and then a pause after the breakout often leads to a very strong trend.

This made traders hesitant to short the double top bear flag that formed a couple of weeks later.

Bars 5 and 6 also tried to complete the base. Often the market breaks below the first bottom by a tick or so, trapping bulls out and bears in, as was the case at bar 5. Bar 6 was an exact test of the bar 5 false breakout of the bar 4 low, and was an outside up entry bar or signal bar for a double bottom bull flag. It led to the bar 7 breakout of the top of the range, which quickly failed in a two-bar reversal.\nThe market made a second one-tick breakout below the trading range at bar 8. It is important to realize that if the market falls below that low by even a tick, traders will start to assume that the bears are taking control. They will see this as effectively a failed attempt at a wedge bottom, where bar 4 was the first push down, the one-tick breakout at bar 5 was the second, and the next one-tick breakout at bar 8 was the third. Once the market fell below bar 8, the target was an approximate measured move down using either the height of the wedge (the bar 6 low to the bar 3 high) or the height of the trading range (the bar 8 low to the bar 7 high). This type of three-push pattern can take place in any market, and the downside breakouts don't have to be exactly one tick. For example, in a stock that is trading around $200, the breakouts that are comparable to bars 5 and 8 in this chart might be 20 cents or more.\nSome traders would see the reversal up from bar 6 as a failed breakout of the bottom of the range, and then bar 7 as a failed breakout of the top of the range.

There were trapped bears on the failed downside breakout and then trapped bulls on the failed upside breakout, and when there are trapped bulls and bears, the next breakout usually results in a decent swing.

After breaking out above bar 5, the market went sideways instead of pulling\nback, and this setup is very strong and fairly common. After the spike up to bar 12, there was a pullback to bar 14 and it formed a double bottom\nbull flag with bar 11. This was followed by a bull channel that lasted for the rest of the day.\nBar 18 formed a double bottom bull flag with bar 16. Remember, the lows don't have to be exactly the same. If a pattern resembles a textbook\nsetup, it will likely behave in a similar way. Bar 29 formed another with bar 27, and again set up a high 2 buy in a strong bull channel. A high 2 is\nsimply a two-legged pullback, which all double bottoms are.\nDeeper Discussion of This Chart\nAs shown in Figure 12.6, yesterday closed with a strong bull run and then a pullback to just below the moving average, where bulls would be looking for a higher low and then a\nsecond leg up. The channel down to bar 6 was steep enough so that traders should not buy the bar 7 outside up breakout on the open. Bar 8 was a strong bull reversal bar, as\nwell as a higher low and a high 2 in a large trading range. It was also a reversal up from consecutive sell climaxes. The first sell climax was the three-bar bear spike that\nfollowed the bar 5 bull channel, and the second sell climax was formed by the two strong bear trend bars that followed the bar 7 attempt to reverse up. Consecutive climaxes\nare usually followed by at least a two-legged countertrend move and often a reversal. Since this was occurring within the first hour, it could be setting up the low of the day and\nbulls should swing much of their long position.\nThe spike up to bar 10 was followed by a large bull trend bar, creating a spike and climax type of spike and channel bull trend. The market corrected down to the bar 14 start of\nthe brief channel, where it formed the expected double bottom bull flag.\nThe protracted bull channel from bar 14 followed a bull spike. Some traders saw the spike as the move from bar 8 to bar 10 and the pullback as the move from bar 10 to bar 11,\nwhere a micro trend line high 1 long set up. The small breakout below that tight channel down to bar 11 was followed by a higher high pullback to bar 12 and then a second leg\ndown to bar 14.\nOther traders, especially those using a higher time frame chart, saw the move from bar 8 to bar 12 as the spike, and the two-legged moving average test at bar 14 as the\npullback that led to the large bull channel.\nThe short below bar 12 was also a reversal from the bar 11 final flag, and a second reversal from yesterday's high.\nThere was a large bear trend bar two bars before bar 14, and this was therefore a spike down. Since it followed a spike up relatively soon (nine bars earlier), it created a buy\nclimax (a bull trend bar followed by a bear trend bar). Although it may not be obvious, you could look at different time frames and find one where this entire pattern is just a two-\nbar reversal (in fact, it was one on the 30 minute chart). This is never necessary because you can infer it from the 5 minute chart. Whenever there is any climax, the market soon\nbecomes uncertain because both the bulls and bears will add to their positions as they attempt to create a channel in their direction. Uncertainty means that the market is in a\ntrading range, and some traders saw the two-legged move up from bar 14 to the slightly higher high at bar 17 as simply a higher high pullback from the bar 14 bear spike. This\nis a plausible interpretation, given that the move had many doji bars. The bulls, however, created a two-bar bull spike up from bar 14, and this created a sell climax with the bear\nbar that formed two bars before bar 14. Again, a bear trend bar followed soon after by a bull trend bar is a sell climax, and you can find some time frame where it is a two-bar\nreversal up.\nBar 18 set up a failed low 2 buy, and then traders had to evaluate the momentum of the upside breakout to determine whether it was more likely to have at least two more legs\nup or simply to have one more push up and form a wedge top (a low 3). Since the price action since bar 10 has been two-sided, this was trading range behavior and it was\nreasonable to be looking for low 2 short setups (you should not do that in a strong bull trend).\nThe market had a large bull trend bar breakout up to bar 19, and this increased the odds of at least two legs up from the bar 18 failed low 2. The bull channel from bar 18 to bar\n19 was tight, with six consecutive bull bodies. When the channel is strong, it is better not to look to short the breakout below the channel, which means that it was better not to\nlook to short a low 3 (a wedge top) and instead look to see if there was a breakout pullback that looked like a good short setup. A breakout pullback would be a second-entry\nshort signal. The move up to bar 20 could have been that setup but it, too, was too strong, since it had five consecutive bull trend bars. At this point, most traders would see the\nmove up from bar 14 as a strong bull trend, even though it was still in a channel, and they would trade it like any strong bull channel, buying for any reason and not getting\ntrapped out by pullbacks.\nWhenever there is a strong spike, you should expect follow-through and you can use measured move projections to find reasonable locations for profit taking. Since they are so\noften reliable, the institutions must be using them as well. The first measurements should be based on the double bottom. Look for a possible profit-taking area by adding the\nheight from bar 1 to bar 5, or from bar 5 to bar 8, to the high of bar 5. Both of these projections were exceeded at bar 24. Since the channel was still steep at that point, more of a\nrally was likely so bulls should still hold some of their longs and should be looking for opportunities to buy more. They can buy using the techniques described in the section on\nchannels in book 1.\nThe next higher target comes from doubling the height of the spike, using either bar 10 or bar 12 as the top of the spike. If you add the number of points from bar 8 to bar 12 to\nthe top of bar 12, that projection was minimally exceeded on the first hour of the next day and it was followed by a 16-point pullback over the next couple of hours.\nBar 24 was the fourth push up in the channel, and when the market failed to reverse on the low 4 after bar 24, it broke out to the upside. In general, traders should not be using\nthe low 4 terminology here since this is a bull market and not a trading range or a bear trend, but the breakout after bar 23 indicates that there were many traders who used the\nfailed low 4 as a reason to cover their longs. The breakout created a gap between the breakout point at the bar 22 high and the breakout pullback at the bar 25 low. A gap that\noccurs after a strong move often becomes a measuring gap, as it did here. The current leg began at the bar 24 channel low and you can take the number of points from that low\nto the middle of the gap and add it to the middle of the gap to find the measured move projection where bulls might take profits. The market missed the target by two ticks on the\nrally to the close, but turned down briefly from it on the open of the next day.\nTraders should be looking for trend lines and trend channel lines and redrawing them as the channel progresses. If you see a failed breakout of the top of the channel, it can\nlead to a reversal. A second failed breakout is an even more reliable short setup. if you draw a bull trend line from the bar 14 to bar 23 lows and create a parallel that you then\nanchor to the top of the bar 12 spike, you then have a channel that contains the price action. Bar 35 was a second failed breakout of the top of the range and a reasonable short\nsetup. The minimum objective is a poke below the bottom of the channel and then a measured move down using the height of the channel and subtracting it from the location\nof the breakout below the channel.\nChannels often correct after a third push. Bars 15, 17, and 19 were three pushes, but the channel was so steep that you should look for a short trade only if there first was a\nstrong downside breakout and then a pullback. The same is true for the three pushes up at bars 24, 26, and 28. The failure to reverse set up the high 2 long above bar 29,\nwhich was followed by five bull trend bars that formed a spike.\nBars 30, 33, and 35 set up another three-push top pattern, and this one was worth taking for a possible high of the day. In the first hour, a reversal can be the high of the day, so\nyou should be willing to be more aggressive. The move down to bar 34 had two strong bear trend bars, so the bears were getting stronger. Bar 35 was a strong bear reversal\nbar and the second reversal down from a breakout of the top of the bull channel, and it was a little above a measured move up using the height of the bar 8 to bar 12 spike.\nToday is a good example of how strong trend channels can have lots of two-sided trading, and pullbacks never look quite strong enough to buy. It had lots of bear trend bars\nthat trapped bears into shorts as they looked for a second leg down. However, buyers returned on every test of the moving average and there was never a good breakout\npullback to short. This told experienced traders to only look to buy. There were only a couple of countertrend scalps, but traders should consider taking them only if they then get\nright back in on the long side with the next buy setup. If they miss that next buy, they are not good enough to be shorting a day like this, because they are likely missing too many\nlong winners as they wait and wait for a rare profitable short scalp. They are on the wrong side of the math and are not maximizing their profit potential because of a lack of\ndiscipline.\nThe entire channel was so steep that you should assume that the spike formed a large spike up on a higher time frame chart as well (in fact, it formed a strong, eight-bar bull\nspike on the 60 minute chart), and should therefore be followed by a higher time frame bull channel. This means that there would likely be follow-through buying on the 5\nminute chart over the next two or three days, and there was. When a 5 minute channel is part of a higher time frame spike, the pullback that eventually follows usually tests only\nthe channel low on the higher time frame chart but not the channel low on the 5 minute chart.\nThere were many breakout tests that tested the earlier breakout to the tick, running stops on traders using a breakeven stop on their swing portion of their long trades. For\nexample, if traders bought the bar 11 high 2 and held long through the bar 12 failed flag (not recommended, because this was a decent short setup at this point of the day), they\nwould have been stopped out to the tick if they used a breakeven stop. However, traders who recognized this strong double bottom pattern would have used a wider stop on the\nswing portion of their trades after going long above the bar 14 two-legged moving average test, expecting a strong bull trend day. Look at the moving average. There were no\ncloses below it after the initial bull spike to bar 10, so do not use a tight stop out of fear of losing a tick or two on your trade. In fact, a trader should be ready tomorrow to buy the\nfirst close below the moving average, and then buy again above the first moving average gap bar below the moving average.\nFigure 12.7 Failed Double Bottom Breakout Is a Wedge Variant\n", "text_clean": "traders that this double bottom bull flag could lead to a strong move up.

The channel down to bar 6 was steep enough so that traders should not buy the bar 7 outside up breakout on the open. Bar 8 was a strong bull reversal bar, as well as a higher low and a high 2 in a large trading range. It was also a reversal up from consecutive sell climaxes. The first sell climax was the three-bar bear spike that followed the bar 5 bull channel, and the second sell climax was formed by the two strong bear trend bars that followed the bar 7 attempt to reverse up.

There is nothing magical about 20 bars. It is just a guideline that is useful to\nremind you that a trend is strong. You can arbitrarily pick any large number of bars and generate a setup that will usually be the same, and it will also\nwork on other time frames.

Even though the move up to bar 11 was composed of six consecutive bull trend bars, there was no clear bottom at bar 10 so traders\nwere looking for shorts around the moving average. The shorting resulted in a small bear inside bar after bar 11 instead of a strong bear trend bar,\nand this meant that most traders believed that the rally at this point was too strong to short. However, the bears became aggressive on the second-\nentry short below bar 13 (the first entry opportunity was one bar earlier).

The bears were so eager to get short that they\nplaced their limit orders at two or three ticks below the moving average because they were not confident that the rally would touch the moving\naverage. If they were confident, they could have placed their limit orders to go short at one tick below the moving average and they then would have\nbecome short on the touch of the moving average. When the market turns down just below the moving average, the bears are very aggressive.

A bar may form that is\nentirely on the other side of the moving average. This is a moving average gap bar, and it sometimes can also be also a 20 gap bar pullback setup.\nA gap is a general term that simply means that there is a space between two points on the chart. For example, if today's open is above yesterday's\nclose, there is a gap up. If the open is above yesterday's high, there will be a gap on the daily chart. A broader use of the term opens up other\ntrading opportunities. For example, if the high of a bar is below the moving average, then there is a gap between that bar and the moving average.\nIn a bull market or sideways market, there is a good chance that the market will move to fill that gap. Sometimes a bar will go above the high of the\nprevious bar, but then, within a bar or two, the pullback continues down again. If the market again goes above the high of a prior bar, this is a\nsecond moving average gap bar setup, or a second attempt to fill a moving average gap in a bull trend, and the odds are excellent that there will be\na tradable rally off this setup. Likewise, gaps above the moving average will tend to get filled in a bear trend or sideways market.\nIf there is a strong trend and this is the first moving average gap bar in the trend, it is usually followed by a test of the trend's extreme. This\npullback to the gap bar is typically strong enough to break the trend line and after the test of the trend's extreme, the market will generally form a\ntwo-legged correction or even a major trend reversal (discussed in book 3). For example, if there is a strong bull and it finally has a bar that has a\nhigh below the moving average and then the next bar trades above the high of that bar, the market will try to form a higher high or lower high test of\nthe bull's extreme. Traders will buy for a swing trade, expecting the market to get near or above the old high. Some traders will scale into additional\nlongs if the pullback below the moving average falls some more (this is discussed in Chapter 31 on scaling into and out of trades). If the market\nrallies to test the old high but there is then a reversal down, there will usually be a more protracted correction that typically has at least two legs and\noften leads to a trend reversal.\nMost bars on most charts are moving average gap bars because most bars do not touch the moving average. However, if there is not a strong\ntrend and a trader fades one (for example, selling one tick below the low of a bar above the moving average), the trader is often just looking for a\nscalp to the moving average where he will take profits. A trader will take the trade only if there is enough room to the moving average to make an\nacceptable profit and only if the trade makes sense in the context of the current price action. So if there is a strong trend, a first moving average\ngap tends to set up swing trades, and if there is not a strong trend and a trader takes a moving average gap bar trade, she is more likely looking for\na scalp.\nFigure 14.1 Moving Average Gaps, Second Signals\nIn Figure 14.1, bar 2 was a second attempt to fill the gap below the moving average in a sideways market. The downward momentum was\nsomewhat strong, which arguably means that the market is not sideways today, but the moving average was basically flat because of yesterday's\nstrong close. Also, there were several bars that overlapped with the bar or two bars before, and bar 2 was the third push down after the two-bar\nbear spike created by the third and fourth bars of the day. Bulls placed buy stops to go long at one tick above the high of bar 2 and looked to take a\nscalper's profit on a test of the moving average.\nBars 3, 4, and 8 were also second attempts (the first attempt can be simply a bull trend bar), or second moving average gap bar entries.\nBar 5 was a moving average gap bar, but traders would not short it for a scalp to the moving average both because there was not enough room\nfor a scalp and because it followed a strong reversal up and a higher low and a second leg up was likely after the bar 4 lower low reversal up.\nBars 6 and 9 were second moving average gap bar short setups. Once the market broke above bar 9, there was then a bull trend because two\nattempts to go down failed (bar 9 was a second moving average gap bar setup, which means that it was a second attempt to close the gap to the\nmoving average).\nBar 7 was a moving average gap bar setup, but since there was so little room to the moving average, traders would be less likely to buy it for a\n", "text_clean": "Chapter 14\nFirst Moving Average Gap Bars Usually a 20 gap bar setup is followed by a test of the extreme, and the next test of the moving average probes even deeper.

Very commonly on strong trend days there will be a strong countertrend panic move that will scare people\nout of their positions, and this normally happens between 11:00 and 11:30 a.m., although it can come earlier or later.

Usually, the trap is a strong\ncountertrend leg, getting hopeful longs to buy aggressively, only to get forced into liquidation as the market quickly reverses back down. Today,\nhowever, the rally from bar 2 was composed of large overlapping dojis, indicating that traders were nervous in both directions. If there was no\nconviction, then how could traders get trapped? Well, the bar before bar 3 attempted to form a double top bear flag, and bar 3 spoiled it by going\nabove the bar 1 high.

This was a bear trend\nresumption day, but since the resumption started so late and it followed a tight trading range with strong two-sided trading (large, overlapping bars\nwith big tails), it resulted in a smaller leg than the sell-off at the open.\nFigure 15.3 Late Trap on Trading Range Day\nThere is often an 11:30 a.m. PST trap on trading range days as well (see Figure 15.3). Here, after spending a couple of hours in the upper half of\nthe day's range, the market ran through the low of the day, trapping out the bulls and trapping in new shorts.

The higher low reversal up at bar 9 was close\nenough to be a double bottom, and the bar 13 higher low at 7:40 a.m. PST was a double bottom pullback. Since the rally off the open was a strong spike up, the market was\nlikely to try to form a channel after a pullback, but it failed with the bar 12 double top with bar 1. This was followed by several bear spikes over the next hour and ultimately a bear\nchannel that reversed up at bar 24 at 11:30 a.m. The bar 22 reversal attempt at 11:00 a.m. failed. The market was in too steep a bear channel, so the first breakout of the\nchannel was likely to be followed by a breakout pullback and a higher-probability long, and bar 24 was the signal bar. It was also the second attempt to reverse up from a new\nlow of the day.\nThe push up to bar 12 created a wedge bear flag, with bars 5 and 8 being the first two pushes up. The market was too steeply up to short the bar 11 breakout of the tight bull\nchannel up from bar 9, but shorting the breakout pullback to the bar 12 higher high was reasonable. It would be safer to wait for the bar 12 outside down bar to close, to see if\nthe bears could own the bar.

Once the momentum of this first up leg wanes, bulls will take partial or full\nprofits and bears will short, just in case the bears are able to maintain control of the market. The bears are not certain if their trend is over and will\nbe willing to initiate new short positions.

The bears will not consider\nshorting again unless this leg falters near the top of the first up leg (a possible double top bear flag). If it does, the new bulls will be quick to exit\nbecause they won't want a loss, and the bears will become more aggressive since they will sense that this second leg up has failed. Eventually, one\nside will win out. This kind of trading goes on all day long in all markets and creates a lot of two-legged moves.\nIn fact, after the market makes a move of any size in one direction, it will eventually try to reverse that move and will often make two attempts at\nthe reversal. This means that every trend and every countertrend move has a good chance of breaking down into two legs, and every leg will try to\nsubdivide into two smaller legs.\nWhen you are looking for a two-legged move and see one but the two legs are in a relatively tight channel of any kind, such as a wedge, they\nmight in fact be subdivisions of the first leg and the channel may actually be only the first of two legs. This is especially true if the number of bars in\neach of the two legs looks inadequate compared to the pattern it is correcting. For example, if there is a wedge top that lasts for two hours and then\na three-bar bear spike and then a three-bar channel, it is likely that the spike and channel together will be only the first leg down, and traders will be\nreluctant to buy heavily until after they see at least one more leg down.\nFigure 16.1 Two-Legged Moves\nIn Figure 16.1, the bear trend down to bar 6 occurred in two legs and the second leg subdivided into two smaller legs.

This is a mathematical concept that means that each segment of a market has the same general patterns as every lower\nand every higher time frame chart. If you remove the time and price labels from your charts, you will usually not be able to tell whether a chart is a 3\nminute, 5 minute, 60 minute, or even a monthly chart. The only time that you can reliably approximate the time frame of a chart is when the average\nbar is only one to three ticks tall, because the chart will be mostly dojis and that only happens in small time frames or in markets with only minimal\nvolume, and you should not be trading those.\nSince every move on every chart will tend to be two-legged and every correction will also tend to be two-legged and every correction of every\ncorrection will tend to be two-legged, a trader who understands this tendency will find lots of opportunities.\nA reliable sign that a pullback in a bull trend or in a trading range has ended is when the current bar's high extends at least one tick above the\nhigh of the prior bar. This leads to a useful concept of counting the number of times that this occurs, which is called “bar counting.” In a sideways or\ndownward move in a bull trend or a trading range, the first bar whose high is above the high of the prior bar is a high 1, and this ends the first leg of\nthe sideways or down move, although this leg may become a small leg in a larger pullback. If the market does not turn into a bull swing and instead\ncontinues sideways or down, label the next occurrence of a bar with a high above the high of the prior bar as a high 2, ending the second leg. There\nneeds to be at least a tiny trend line break between the high 1 and the high 2 to indicate that the trend traders are still active. Without this, do not yet\nlook to buy, since the high 1 and high 2 are more likely just part of a channel down that is forming a complex first leg down.\nIn a strong upswing, the high 2 entry can be higher than that of the high 1, and in a strong downswing, a low 2 entry can be lower than that of the\nlow 1. Incidentally, a high 2 in a bull trend and a low 2 in a bear trend are often referred to as ABC corrections, where the first leg is the A, the\nchange in direction that forms the high 1 or low 1 entry is the B, and the final leg of the pullback is the C. The breakout from the C is a high 2 entry\nbar in a bull ABC correction and a low 2 entry bar in a bear ABC correction.\nThere is an important difference between a high 2 in a bull trend and a high 2 in a trading range, and between a low 2 in a bear trend and a low 2\nin a trading range. For example, when there is a high 2 setup in a bull trend, it is usually at or above the moving average and the trend is strong\nenough for you to buy near the high of the day. You are buying a continuation pattern in a trend and therefore can buy near the top of the trend.\nHowever, when you are buying a high 2 in a trading range, you are usually looking to buy a reversal where the setup is below the moving average\nand near the bottom of the range. If you think that the market is in a trading range, it is risky to buy a high 2 above the moving average and near the\nhigh of the trading range. In fact, since this trade will likely fail, you should instead consider shorting using a limit order at or above the high of the\nhigh 2 signal bar. If the high 2 is likely to fail, why would it ever trigger? It triggers because the bears are looking to short above bars, and less so\njust below the highs of bars. They place limit orders to short at and above the high of the prior bar. With a relative lack of bears willing to short just\nbelow the high of the bar, the bulls are unopposed and are able to push the market above the high of the prior bar, hoping that lots of bulls will enter\non buy stops. The high of the bar acts as a magnet, and the push above the bar is a small buy vacuum. The bulls find that there is an overwhelming\nnumber of bears waiting to short there. The result is that the high 2 triggers, but the market immediately turns down. Those bulls who bought over the\nlast several ticks quickly see the lack of a rally above the high of the prior bar. Because the market is not doing what they expected, they exit and\nwill not look to buy again for at least a few bars. Their selling out of their longs contributes to the sell-off. The opposite is true of a low 2 in a trading\nrange. You should only look to sell a low 2 above the moving average and near the top of the trading range because you are trading a reversal and\nnot a continuation pattern. You are trying to short the end of a leg up and are therefore trading against a small trend. If one forms near the bottom of\na trading range and you believe that the market is now in a trading range and not in a bear trend, it is better to buy at or below the low 2 signal bar,\nexpecting the low 2 to fail and form a type of double bottom. These expected failures usually happen when the market appears to be trending but\nyou think that the market has instead entered a trading range.\nA high 1 in a bull trend and a low 1 in a bear trend can have different risk/reward profiles depending on where each is in the trend. For example, if\nthe market is bottoming and it forms a failed low 1, buying above the bar is taking the first high 1 entry of the new bull trend. The odds of success\nmight be only 50–50, but the risk is small and the potential reward is large. You have a small chance of making a big profit. A high 1 long trade after\nthe initial spike up in a new bull trend has a high probability of being at least a successful swing trade. The risk is small and the potential reward and\nprobability of success are high. However, if the market is forming its third consecutive high 1 setup, the odds of a swing are small so traders should\nscalp. This means that the risk and potential reward are both small, and the probability is less than it was for the first high 1.\nSome bull pullbacks can grow further and form a high 3 or a high 4. When a high 4 forms, it sometimes begins with a high 2 and this high 2 fails\nto go very far. It is instead followed by a bear breakout and another two legs down and a second high 2, and the entire move is simply a higher time\nframe high 2. At other times, the high 4 is a small spike and channel bear trend where the first or second push down is a bear spike and the next\npushes down are in a bear channel. If the high 4 fails to resume the trend and the market falls below its low, it is likely that the market is no longer\nforming a pullback in a bull trend and instead is in a bear swing. Wait for more price action to unfold before placing a trade.\nWhen a bear trend or a sideways market is correcting sideways or up, the first bar with a low below the low of the prior bar is a low 1, ending the\nfirst leg of the correction, which can be as brief as that single bar. Subsequent occurrences are called the low 2, low 3, and low 4 entries. If the low 4\nfails (a bar extends above the high of the low 4 signal bar after the low 4 short triggered), the price action indicates that the bears have lost control\nand either the market will become two-sided, with bulls and bears alternating control, or the bulls will gain control. In any case, the bears can best\ndemonstrate that they have regained control by breaking a bull trend line with strong momentum.\nIf the market is in a clear bull trend, do not look for low 1 or low 2 shorts, because those are setups only in bear trends and trading ranges. If the\nmarket is in a clear bear trend, do not look for high 1 or high 2 buys, because those are setups only in bull trends and trading ranges. In fact, if the\nmarket is in a bear trend, you can often look to short above the high of the prior bar because buying a high 1 in a bear trend is a low-probability\ntrade. That means that if it has only about a 40 percent chance of being a successful long, it has about a 60 percent chance of hitting the protective\nstop before hitting a profit-taking limit order. If you are scalping on the 5 minute Emini chart, then there is a 60 percent chance that the market will\nfall and hit a two-point stop before it hits a limit order five ticks above the signal bar. So if there is a 60 percent chance it will fall two points before\nrising five ticks, this is a great setup for a short.

It is very easy to\nsee lots of high and low 1 and 2 patterns in trading ranges, and it is very important that you do not overtrade. When the market is mostly sideways\nwith lots of overlap among the bars and the range is not a small flag in a very strong trend, most traders should step aside and not take any trades.\nWhy is that? If you are looking for a high 2 or a low 2, you are looking to enter on a stop at either the top or the bottom of a tight trading range and\nyou are doing the exact opposite of what the institutions are doing. When the market goes above the high of the prior bar in a tight trading range,\nthey are taking profits on their longs or they are shorting, so you do not want to be buying. Your job is to follow what they are doing; it is not to ignore\nwhat they are doing and to fool yourself into believing that you have some magical setup that will make you a lot of money as long as you keep\ntrading it. Tight trading ranges can form as small flags in very strong trends, and when they do it is reasonable to look to enter on a stop on the\nbreakout of the range. For example, if there is a strong four-bar bear spike and there is no climax or strong reversal as the market goes sideways\nfor 10 bars, it makes sense to go short on a stop below a bear trend bar. But if instead the day is a trading range day and the tight trading range is\nin the middle third of the day, most traders should never place a trade based on bar counting.\nWhen the market is in a tight trading range, it often reverses direction repeatedly, so if you take every high 1, 2, 3, and 4 and also short every low\n1, 2, 3, and 4, over the course of an hour you will lose all of the money that you made in the past week. In Chapter 22 on tight trading ranges, I\ndiscuss this in more detail. There are no magical setups, and every setup has an environment where the math gives it an edge, as well as other\nenvironments where it will lose. Trading based on bar counts requires a market that has swings. If the market is in a tight trading range, do not trade\nunless you are a very experienced trader and you are comfortable shorting above the high of the prior bar instead of buying there on a stop, and\nbuying below the low of the prior bar instead of shorting there on a stop.\nThere are variations on this numbering, but the goal is still to help spot two-legged corrections. For example, in a strong bull trend, a two-legged\npullback can form and have just a high 1 but functionally be a two-legged pullback. You can infer it from the appearance on the 5 minute chart, and\nyou can confirm it by looking at a smaller time frame chart, although this is not necessary. It does not matter if you call it a high 1 on the chart in front\nof you, a high 2 variant, or a smaller time frame high 2, as long as you understand what the market is doing. If there is a bear close (or two), this can\nrepresent the first leg down even if the next bar does not extend above the high of the bear bar. If that next bar has a bull close but its high is still\nbelow the trend high, it then becomes the end of the first down leg if the next bar or so is again a bear trend bar. If the next bar extends below its\nlow, look for a bar within the next few bars that extends above the high of its prior bar, ending the two legs down. View each bar as a potential\nsignal bar, and place a buy stop at one tick above its high. Once filled, you now have a variant of a high 2. This entry bar is, strictly speaking, just a\nhigh 1, but treat it as a high 2. That bear bar at the start of the pullback was followed by a bar with a bull close. On a smaller time frame, this was\nalmost certainly a small down leg followed by an up leg that became a lower high, and then finally another push down to where the high 2 ended the\nsecond leg.\nPullbacks often grow and evolve into larger pullbacks. For example, if there is a bull trend and a high 1 long entry fails to reach a new high and\ninstead there is a lower high and then another leg down, traders will look for a high 2 setup to buy. If the high 2 triggers but the rally does not go very\nfar and the market turns down again below the low of the high 2 signal bar, traders will then look to buy either a high 3 (a wedge or a triangle) or a\nhigh 4 pullback. Whenever there is a strong breakout below a high 2 or wedge (high 3) buy signal bar, the market usually will have at least two more\npushes down. If the breakout below the high 2 signal bar is not strong and the entire move down has a wedge shape and reverses up from a trend\nchannel line, then the high 3 is forming a wedge bull flag and is often a reliable buy setup. Remember, this is a pullback in a bull trend, and not a\nreversal attempt in a bear trend, where traders need a clear demonstration of bullish strength before looking to buy, as discussed in the section in\nbook 3 on reversals. If the breakout below the high 2 buy signal bar reverses up after a second push down and the four pushes down are in\nsomething of a channel and does not look particularly strong, it is a high 4 buy setup. Some high 4 buy setups are simply high 2 buy setups on\nhigher time frames, where the two legs each subdivide into two smaller legs. If the breakout below the failed high 2 has strong momentum and the\nentire pullback from the top of the selloff is in a relatively tight channel, then buying the high 3 is risky. Instead, traders should wait to see if there is a\nbreakout above the bear channel and then a breakout pullback. Whenever a trader wonders if the channel down might be too strong to buy above a\nhigh 3 or high 4 signal bar, he should treat the setup like any other channel breakout, as was discussed in book 1. Wait to see how strong the bull\nbreakout is before looking to buy. If the breakout is strong, then traders can look to buy a pullback. If it is so strong that it has a series of bull trend\nbars without a pullback, which can happen but is unusual, the market would have become always-in long and traders can buy for any reason,\nincluding on the close of any strong bull trend bar. Since the stop is below the bottom of the spike, which can be far away, the position size should\nbe small. If instead the market falls below the low of the bar 4 signal bar, the market is likely in a bear trend and traders should start to look to sell\nrallies rather than to continue to look to buy.\nThe opposite is true in a bear rally. If the low 2 short fails and the market continues to rally, look at the momentum of the move up from the failed\nlow 2. If it is not too strong and the market is in a channel, especially if it has a wedge shape, look to short the low 3, which would be a wedge bear\nflag. If the momentum up is very strong, like if there is a two- or three-bar strong bull spike up from the failed low 2, look for at least two more legs up\nand do not short the low 3. Short the low 4 only if the overall picture supports a short, and do not short if you believe that the market has now\nconverted into a bull trend.\nAs is discussed in the chapter on reversals in the third book, when traders are looking for a reversal down, they often look for a high 1, high 2, or\ntriangle (a high 3) pattern that they expect will fail and become the final flag of the bull leg, and then short above the buy signal bar. Since the\nbreakout is a test of the high, it creates a double top (the breakout might form a lower high or a higher high, but since it is a second push up and it is\nturning down, it is a type of double top, as discussed in book 3). When a person shorts above a high 2 buy signal bar, he is expecting the market to\ntrade down into a trading range or new bear trend. Since a double top is two pushes up, and the trader is expecting that it is at the top of a trading\nrange or new bear swing, and is also a low 2 sell setup (selling below the low of the bar that created the double top). Almost every reversal down\ncomes from some form of double top. If the top is after just a small leg up in a trading range, the double top will often involve only a few bars and be\na micro double top. The same is true of most bottoms. They form from failed low 1 or low 2 or triangle breakouts, which create double bottoms and\nfinal flag reversals up. Since a trader is expecting a move up into a trading range or a new bull, a double bottom is also a high 2 buy setup, with the\nentry at one tick above the high of the bar that created the last push down to the double bottom.\n", "text_clean": "As you are counting these pullbacks, you will often see the market continue its correction instead of reversing, in which case you have to change your perspective. If you thought that the market was in a trading range with simply a strong new high and then see a low 2 above the old high (a sell setup), but instead of falling, the market continues up, you should begin to look for high 1 and 2 buy entries. It is likely that the bull strength is sufficient for you to be trading only longs. You should defer looking for low 1 and 2 shorts until the bears demonstrate enough strength to make a tradable down move likely (like a bull trend line break followed by a failed test of the swing high).\nNotice that in trading ranges, it is common to see a high 1, high 2, low 1, and low 2 all present in the course of 10 bars or so, even though a high 2 is bullish and a low 2 is bearish.

If the low 2 short fails and the market continues to rally, look at the momentum of the move up from the failed low 2. If it is not too strong and the market is in a channel, especially if it has a wedge shape, look to short the low 3, which would be a wedge bear flag. If the momentum up is very strong, like if there is a two- or three-bar strong bull spike up from the failed low 2, look for at least two more legs up and do not short the low 3.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 109, "text_raw": "High 3 and low 3 patterns should be traded like wedges (or a traditional triangle, if the pattern is mostly horizontal) because functionally they are\nthe same. However, to keep the terminology consistent, it is better to call them wedges when they act as reversal patterns because by definition a\nhigh 3 is a pullback (a wedge bull flag) in a bull trend or trading range, and a low 3 is a wedge bear flag in a bear trend or a trading range. For\nexample, if there is a bull trend or a trading range, a high 3 means that there were three legs down, and that sets up a buy signal above the high of\nthe signal bar. If there is a bear trend, you are looking for low 1, 2, 3, and 4 setups and not high 1, 2, 3, and 4 patterns. If there is a clear wedge\nbottom in a bear trend, you should look to buy the reversal; but since it is in a bear trend, you should call this a wedge bottom and not a high 3.\nLikewise, if there is a bear trend or a trading range, a low 3 means that there were three pushes up and you should trade it like a wedge top. If there\nis a bull trend, you should not be looking for a low 3 to short, but shorting below a wedge top can be acceptable.\nThere is also a variation for a failed high/low 4. If the signal bar for the high 4 or low 4 is particularly small, especially if it is a doji, sometimes the\nentry bar will quickly reverse into an outside bar, running the protective stops of the traders who just entered. When the signal bar is small, to avoid\na whipsaw it is often best to place your protective stop at more than one tick beyond the signal bar (maybe three ticks, but no more than a total of\neight ticks from your entry in the Emini when the average range is about 10 points) and still to treat the pattern as valid even though technically it\nfailed, albeit by only a tick or so. Remember, everything is subjective and a trader is always looking for something close to perfect, but never\nexpecting perfection, because perfection is rare.\nBe aware that complex corrections on the 5 minute chart often appear as simple high/low 1 or 2 corrections on higher time frame charts. It is not\nworth looking at the higher time frame charts since the trades are evident on the 5 minute chart and you risk distracting yourself looking for rare\nsignals and missing too many 5 minute signals.\nA high 1 buy setup is a failed attempt by the market to reverse down, and a low 1 short setup is a failed rally attempt in a bear trend. Because\nstrong trends usually continue, reversal attempts almost always fail. You can profit by betting on the failure. You enter exactly where those trapped\nfaders (traders trading against the trend) will exit with their losses. Their exit stop is your entry stop.\nThe most reliable high 1 and low 1 entries occur when there is a false breakout of a micro trend line in the spike phase of a trend, which is the\nstrongest segment of the trend. Traders see a spike and start looking to buy a high 1, but they are overlooking the second critical component of a\nhigh 1 buy setup. The final component is a filter—do not take a high 1 following a significant buy climax, and don't take a low 1 short after a\nsignificant sell climax. Yes, you need a bull spike; but you also need a strong bull trend. One of the most common mistakes that traders make is that\nthey trade on hope and buy every high 1, expecting a trend to follow. Instead, they have to force themselves to wait for the bull trend to form and then\nlook for a high 1. If the bull spike is strong, but still below earlier highs on the chart, the market might still be in a trading range, which makes buying\nabove a high 1 riskier. The high 1 buy setup could easily turn into the final flag of the rally before a big correction or a reversal. The bull spike that is\nracing up might be due to a buy vacuum test of the trading range high and not a new bull trend. If both the bulls and the bears expect the top of the\ntrading range to get tested, once the market gets close to the top, the bulls will buy aggressively and relentlessly, confident that the market will make\nit up to the magnet that is just a little higher. The strong bears see the same thing and stop shorting. Why should they short now when they can sell at\nan even better price in a few minutes? The result is a very strong bull spike that leads to a reversal once it reaches around the top of the trading\nrange, at which point smart traders would not be buying the closes of the strong bull trend bars or the high 1 buy setups. In fact, many would be\nshorting, using limit orders, since they expect that this breakout attempt will be like most strong breakout attempts, and will fail. For traders to buy a\nhigh 1, they need a strong bull spike and a bull trend, not simply a spike up within a trading range. Also, they should not buy the high 1 if the bull\nspike ended with too strong a buy climax.\nThe same is true for a low 1 short. Wait for the bear trend, not just a bear spike within a trading range, and then look for a spike with a low 1 sell\nsetup. Don't simply short every low 1 after every spike, because most spikes occur in trading ranges, and shorting a low 1 at the bottom of a trading\nrange is a losing strategy because the low 1 setup has a good chance of being the final flag in the leg down; the market might then have a large\ncorrection up or even a bull reversal. If traders are looking to buy a high 1 or short a low 1, they should do so only in the spike phase of a trend and\nnot take the trade if there is evidence of a possible climax. For example, if you are looking to buy a high 1 setup, you are betting that the pullback\nwill be minimal and have only one leg. Many high 1 setups are just one- or two-bar pullbacks after sharp three- to five-bar spikes, while others are\nfour- or five-bar pullbacks to the moving average in extremely strong trends that have run for five to 10 bars, which can be a little too far, too fast. If\nyou are buying such a brief pullback, you believe that there is tremendous urgency in the market and that this brief pullback might be your only\nchance to buy below the high of what you believe is a very strong bull trend. If the market goes sideways for five bars and has several small dojis,\nthe market has lost its urgency and it is better to wait before buying. If a high 2 forms, it is a safer buy setup.\nThe most common reason for a trader failing to buy a high 1 pullback is that the trader was hoping for a larger pullback. However, it is important\nto get long when there is a strong bull trend, and traders should place a buy stop above the prior swing high, in case the pullback is brief and the bull\ntrend quickly resumes. The same is true in a strong bear trend. If the three criteria for shorting a low 1 are present (a strong bear trend, a strong\nbear spike, and no strong sell climax), traders must get short. If they are deciding whether to place an order to short below a low 1 signal bar, they\nshould place an order to short at one tick below the swing low. Then, if they end up not shorting the low 1 and the market races down, they will be\nswept into the strong bear trend. This is far better than watching from the sidelines and waiting for the next pullback. If they short the low 1, they can\nthen cancel the order to short below the swing low.\nIf that high 1 is such a reliable buy setup in the spike phase of a strong bull trend, how could it possibly form when the institutions know that there\nmight be an 80 percent chance of the trend resuming and being followed by a new high? Why would they ever allow the pullback if they believe the\nmarket will go higher? It is because they created the pullback. The spike was caused by many firms simultaneously buying relentlessly, which\nmeans that they were scaling into their long positions during their buy programs. At some point, each of those firms will start scaling out of its\nposition, and once enough of them stop buying and begin to sell out of their positions, a bar will form with a low that is below the low of the prior bar.\nMany other firms will buy as the market falls below the other bar, but just for a scalp if the trend is not too strong. From this point on, firms will all be\nscaling out; because of this, the breakout above the high 1 setup often results in only a scalp. In the very strongest of trends, it is a swing trade and\nthere might be one or two more high 1 setups at a higher level and then some high 2 buy setups; but in all cases, pullbacks are caused by\ninstitutions taking some profits from their lower entries. They are in the business of making money, which means that they have to take profits at\nsome point, and when enough of them begin to take partial profits at one time, they create bull flags, like high 1, high 2, or larger pullbacks. The\nopposite is true in bear trends.\nThis is an important observation because you now see that you should buy a high 1 long setup only when the trend is very strong, which usually\nmeans only in the spike phase and only when the market is clearly in a trend. Finally, don't buy a high 1 after a climax or a reversal, and do not buy a\nhigh 1 pullback at the top of a trading range because the bull trend has not yet broken out. High 1 buy setups at the tops of strong bull spikes and\nlow 1 short setups at the bottom of strong bear spikes are common in trading ranges and are usually traps. In fact, they are often good fade setups.\nFor example, if a high 1 is setting up at the top of a trading range, especially if the signal bar is a doji bar, it is often sensible to place a limit order to\n", "text_clean": "High 3 and low 3 patterns should be traded like wedges (or a traditional triangle, if the pattern is mostly horizontal) because functionally they are the same. However, to keep the terminology consistent, it is better to call them wedges when they act as reversal patterns because by definition a high 3 is a pullback (a wedge bull flag) in a bull trend or trading range, and a low 3 is a wedge bear flag in a bear trend or a trading range. For example, if there is a bull trend or a trading range, a high 3 means that there were three legs down, and that sets up a buy signal above the high of the signal bar. If there is a bear trend, you are looking for low 1, 2, 3, and 4 setups and not high 1, 2, 3, and 4 patterns. If there is a clear wedge bottom in a bear trend, you should look to buy the reversal; but since it is in a bear trend, you should call this a wedge bottom and not a high 3.\nLikewise, if there is a bear trend or a trading range, a low 3 means that there were three pushes up and you should trade it like a wedge top. If there is a bull trend, you should not be looking for a low 3 to short, but shorting below a wedge top can be acceptable.\nThere is also a variation for a failed high/low 4. If the signal bar for the high 4 or low 4 is particularly small, especially if it is a doji, sometimes the entry bar will quickly reverse into an outside bar, running the protective stops of the traders who just entered. When the signal bar is small, to avoid a whipsaw it is often best to place your protective stop at more than one tick beyond the signal bar (maybe three ticks, but no more than a total of eight ticks from your entry in the Emini when the average range is about 10 points) and still to treat the pattern as valid even though technically it failed, albeit by only a tick or so. Remember, everything is subjective and a trader is always looking for something close to perfect, but never expecting perfection, because perfection is rare.\nBe aware that complex corrections on the 5 minute chart often appear as simple high/low 1 or 2 corrections on higher time frame charts. It is not worth looking at the higher time frame charts since the trades are evident on the 5 minute chart and you risk distracting yourself looking for rare signals and missing too many 5 minute signals.\nA high 1 buy setup is a failed attempt by the market to reverse down, and a low 1 short setup is a failed rally attempt in a bear trend. Because strong trends usually continue, reversal attempts almost always fail. You can profit by betting on the failure. You enter exactly where those trapped faders (traders trading against the trend) will exit with their losses. Their exit stop is your entry stop.\nThe most reliable high 1 and low 1 entries occur when there is a false breakout of a micro trend line in the spike phase of a trend, which is the strongest segment of the trend. Traders see a spike and start looking to buy a high 1, but they are overlooking the second critical component of a high 1 buy setup. The final component is a filter—do not take a high 1 following a significant buy climax, and don't take a low 1 short after a significant sell climax. Yes, you need a bull spike; but you also need a strong bull trend. One of the most common mistakes that traders make is that they trade on hope and buy every high 1, expecting a trend to follow. Instead, they have to force themselves to wait for the bull trend to form and then look for a high 1. If the bull spike is strong, but still below earlier highs on the chart, the market might still be in a trading range, which makes buying above a high 1 riskier. The high 1 buy setup could easily turn into the final flag of the rally before a big correction or a reversal. The bull spike that is racing up might be due to a buy vacuum test of the trading range high and not a new bull trend. If both the bulls and the bears expect the top of the trading range to get tested, once the market gets close to the top, the bulls will buy aggressively and relentlessly, confident that the market will make it up to the magnet that is just a little higher. The strong bears see the same thing and stop shorting. Why should they short now when they can sell at an even better price in a few minutes? The result is a very strong bull spike that leads to a reversal once it reaches around the top of the trading range, at which point smart traders would not be buying the closes of the strong bull trend bars or the high 1 buy setups. In fact, many would be shorting, using limit orders, since they expect that this breakout attempt will be like most strong breakout attempts, and will fail. For traders to buy a high 1, they need a strong bull spike and a bull trend, not simply a spike up within a trading range. Also, they should not buy the high 1 if the bull spike ended with too strong a buy climax.\nThe same is true for a low 1 short. Wait for the bear trend, not just a bear spike within a trading range, and then look for a spike with a low 1 sell setup. Don't simply short every low 1 after every spike, because most spikes occur in trading ranges, and shorting a low 1 at the bottom of a trading range is a losing strategy because the low 1 setup has a good chance of being the final flag in the leg down; the market might then have a large correction up or even a bull reversal. If traders are looking to buy a high 1 or short a low 1, they should do so only in the spike phase of a trend and not take the trade if there is evidence of a possible climax. For example, if you are looking to buy a high 1 setup, you are betting that the pullback will be minimal and have only one leg. Many high 1 setups are just one- or two-bar pullbacks after sharp three- to five-bar spikes, while others are four- or five-bar pullbacks to the moving average in extremely strong trends that have run for five to 10 bars, which can be a little too far, too fast. If you are buying such a brief pullback, you believe that there is tremendous urgency in the market and that this brief pullback might be your only chance to buy below the high of what you believe is a very strong bull trend. If the market goes sideways for five bars and has several small dojis, the market has lost its urgency and it is better to wait before buying. If a high 2 forms, it is a safer buy setup.\nThe most common reason for a trader failing to buy a high 1 pullback is that the trader was hoping for a larger pullback. However, it is important to get long when there is a strong bull trend, and traders should place a buy stop above the prior swing high, in case the pullback is brief and the bull trend quickly resumes. The same is true in a strong bear trend. If the three criteria for shorting a low 1 are present (a strong bear trend, a strong bear spike, and no strong sell climax), traders must get short. If they are deciding whether to place an order to short below a low 1 signal bar, they should place an order to short at one tick below the swing low. Then, if they end up not shorting the low 1 and the market races down, they will be swept into the strong bear trend. This is far better than watching from the sidelines and waiting for the next pullback. If they short the low 1, they can then cancel the order to short below the swing low.\nIf that high 1 is such a reliable buy setup in the spike phase of a strong bull trend, how could it possibly form when the institutions know that there might be an 80 percent chance of the trend resuming and being followed by a new high? Why would they ever allow the pullback if they believe the market will go higher? It is because they created the pullback. The spike was caused by many firms simultaneously buying relentlessly, which means that they were scaling into their long positions during their buy programs. At some point, each of those firms will start scaling out of its position, and once enough of them stop buying and begin to sell out of their positions, a bar will form with a low that is below the low of the prior bar.\nMany other firms will buy as the market falls below the other bar, but just for a scalp if the trend is not too strong. From this point on, firms will all be scaling out; because of this, the breakout above the high 1 setup often results in only a scalp. In the very strongest of trends, it is a swing trade and there might be one or two more high 1 setups at a higher level and then some high 2 buy setups; but in all cases, pullbacks are caused by institutions taking some profits from their lower entries. They are in the business of making money, which means that they have to take profits at some point, and when enough of them begin to take partial profits at one time, they create bull flags, like high 1, high 2, or larger pullbacks. The opposite is true in bear trends.\nThis is an important observation because you now see that you should buy a high 1 long setup only when the trend is very strong, which usually means only in the spike phase and only when the market is clearly in a trend. Finally, don't buy a high 1 after a climax or a reversal, and do not buy a high 1 pullback at the top of a trading range because the bull trend has not yet broken out. High 1 buy setups at the tops of strong bull spikes and low 1 short setups at the bottom of strong bear spikes are common in trading ranges and are usually traps.

Since you expect the high 1 long to fail, you think that it will reverse and hit a two-point stop\nbefore it will go six ticks and fill your profit-taking limit order for a one-point scalp. When you expect a high 1 long failure, you believe that the\nprobability of the protective stop being hit before the profit-taking limit order is filled is at least 60 percent. If you fade the high 1 by going short with\na limit order at the high of the signal bar, you expect that it will not go six ticks up and you can therefore use a six-tick protective stop. Since you feel\nthat it is a bad buy setup, you believe that it will fall seven ticks below your entry price, which is eight ticks below the long entry price of the bulls who\nbought on a stop at one tick above the signal bar. This means that you can scalp out of your short with a six-tick limit order and have at least a 60\npercent chance of making six ticks while risking six ticks, which is a good trade. You can also place a limit order to go long at or below the low of a\nlow 1 short signal bar if it forms at the bottom of a trading range and you believe that a low 1 short would fail.\nIf that high 1 at the top of the trading range was so strong, why was the spike not strong enough to break far above the trading range and have\nseveral bars of follow-through? The market is telling you that the spike is not very strong and you should therefore listen. Just because the spike has\nfour bull trend bars does not make it the spike phase of a strong bull trend. Look at the entire chart and make sure that the spike is part of a strong\ntrend and not just a trap at the top of a trading range. Remember, the market often has strong bull spikes at the tops of trading ranges because the\nstrong traders step aside and don't sell until the market gets to the top of the range or even breaks out for a bar or two. The bulls then sell out of their\nlongs to take profits and the bears sell to initiate new shorts. This vacuum sucks the market up quickly but it has nothing to do with a trend. Traders\nare very eager to sell but it does not make sense for them to sell if they think that the market will go up several more ticks to test the top of the\nrange. Instead, they stop selling and wait for the market to get there; then they appear out of nowhere and the strong rally reverses, trapping\nbeginners into buying near the high of the day. A high 1 is a buy setup only in a clear bull trend and not in a spike near the top of a trading range. A\nlow 1 is a short setup only in a clear, strong bear trend.\nHigh 1 and low 1 patterns are with-trend setups, so if one occurs within a pullback in a trend but in the direction of the pullback and not the trend,\ndo not take the trade. Instead, wait for it to fail and then enter with the trend on the breakout pullback. For example, if there is a bull trend and then a\nfour-bar-long bear micro trend line forms at or above the moving average, do not short the failed breakout above the trend line. You do not want to\nbe shorting a bull trend at the bottom of a pullback near the moving average, which is commonly near the end of the pullback. Instead, look for this\nfailure to fail and turn into a breakout pullback, which will be in the direction of the trend (up). There is a breakout above the bear micro trend line\nthat failed. The failed breakout traded down briefly, but it failed to go far and it reversed up. Once it reversed up, the reversal up was a breakout\npullback entry from the initial breakout above the micro trend line. However, if the bear leg has four or more consecutive bear trend bars and the\nfailed micro trend line setup is below the moving average, it will likely be a profitable short scalp, even though the day may be a bull trend day.\nTrends have trending highs and lows. In a bull trend, each low is usually above the prior low (a higher low) and each high gets higher (a higher\nhigh); in bear trends, there are lower highs and lower lows. In general, the terms higher high and higher low are reserved for situations in which a\nbull trend appears to be in place or in the process of developing, and lower low and lower high imply that a bear trend might be in effect. These\nterms imply that there will have been at least a minor trend line break, so you are considering buying a higher low in a bull trend (a pullback) or in a\nbear trend (countertrend but it may be a reversal) and selling a lower high in a bull trend or a bear trend. When trading countertrend, you should\nscalp most or all of your position unless the reversal is strong.\nOnce a high 2 long triggers in a bull trend or in a trading range, if the market then reverses and trades below the low of the pattern before\nreaching at least a scalper's profit, the high 2 buy has failed. Likewise, if there is a low 2 short entry in a bear trend or in a trading range and the\nmarket fails to reach at least a scalper's profit and instead breaks out above the top of the pattern, the low 2 sell has failed. The most common\ncause of a high or low 2 failure is that the trader is in denial about a trend reversal and is still looking for trades in the direction of the old trend.\nA high or low 2 is one of the most reliable with-trend setups. If a trade fails, the pattern will usually evolve and get either one or two more\ncorrective legs. For example, if the market is moving down in a pullback in a bull trend or in a trading range and forms a high 2, but within a bar or\ntwo a bar trades below the low of the signal bar, the high 2 has failed to reverse the market upward out of the bull flag. When that happens, the\ndownswing will usually try to reverse up again in a high 3 or a high 4. The high 3 represents three pushes down and is therefore a variation of a\nwedge. If the market is more likely to continue lower, you would get stopped out of your long if you bought the high 3. However, if you simply always\nwait for a high 4, you will miss many good high 3 long trades. The market often gives traders a clue as to which scenario is more likely. That clue\ncomes in the form of the momentum that follows the failed high 2. If the market does not significantly change its momentum from that of the down\nmove, it is more likely that the market will reverse up on the high 3, creating a wedge bull flag buy signal (and the breakout below the high 2\nbecomes an exhaustion gap, instead of a measuring gap). If instead there is a large bear breakout bar or two, this increases the odds that there\nwill be at least two more legs down, and traders should wait for the high 4 before looking to buy. In this case, the breakout bar is likely to become a\nmeasuring gap and lead to a measured move down. Whenever there is a strong spike, many traders will start the count over again and will expect\nat least two more legs down before they are willing to buy again. The reversal up after the first leg is the first attempt to break out above the steep\nbear trend line and is therefore likely to fail. The second attempt up is the breakout pullback from that breakout, and, since it is a breakout pullback\n(whether it is a lower low or a higher low), it is more likely to succeed. If the market reverses up from the high 4 after the failed high 2, usually the\npattern is simply a complex high 2 where both legs subdivided into two smaller legs. This is usually evident on a higher time frame chart, where a\nsimple high 2 will often be clearly seen. If that high 4 fails, the market is more likely now in a bear trend instead of just a pullback in a bull trend, and\ntraders should then reevaluate the strength and direction of the market before placing any more trades.\nThe opposite is true in a rising leg in a bear trend or a trading range. If the low 2 triggers a short entry, but within a bar or two there is a bar that\ntrades above the high of the signal bar and the momentum is unremarkable, a profitable low 3 setup (a wedge bear flag) is more likely. However, if\nthere are a couple of large bull trend bars, then the breakout is strong and the market will likely have at least two more legs up, so traders should not\nshort the low 3. Instead, they should wait to see if a low 4 sets up. If the momentum up after the low 3 is very strong, the market is likely in a steep\nbull channel and it is better not to short the low 4, which is the first breakout of the bottom of a strong bull channel. Instead, traders should wait to see\nif a higher high or lower high breakout pullback sets up. If so, this is a second-entry short and a lower-risk trade. However, if the bull channel is not\nvery tight and there is some reason to look for a top, such as the low 3 being a small final flag or a second attempt to reverse down after moving\nabove a swing high or a reversal from a higher time frame bear trend line, then traders can short the low 4. Low 4 signal bars are often small, and\nwhen they are, the market often quickly reverses up and runs the protective stops above the low 4 signal bar, and then once again reverses down\ninto a good bear swing. Because of this, when there is a small low 4 or high 4 signal bar, use a money management stop of about two points in the\nEmini instead of a price action stop beyond the signal bar.\nThe key to understanding the concept of high/low 2 setups is to remember its intent. The idea is that the market will tend to make two attempts at\nanything, and in its attempt to correct, it frequently will try twice to reverse the trend. The advantage of buying a high 2 pullback in a bull trend is that\nthere is very little thought involved and it is easy to do. The difficulty comes when a correction has two attempts but does not form a clear high or low\n2. That is why it is necessary to look at variations—you can make money by trading two-legged pullbacks even when they don't offer a perfect high\n", "text_clean": "short at or above the top of the high 1 buy signal bar.

For example, if there is a bull trend and then a four-bar-long bear micro trend line forms at or above the moving average, do not short the failed breakout above the trend line. You do not want to be shorting a bull trend at the bottom of a pullback near the moving average, which is commonly near the end of the pullback. Instead, look for this failure to fail and turn into a breakout pullback, which will be in the direction of the trend (up). There is a breakout above the bear micro trend line that failed. The failed breakout traded down briefly, but it failed to go far and it reversed up. Once it reversed up, the reversal up was a breakout pullback entry from the initial breakout above the micro trend line. However, if the bear leg has four or more consecutive bear trend bars and the failed micro trend line setup is below the moving average, it will likely be a profitable short scalp, even though the day may be a bull trend day.\nTrends have trending highs and lows.

The most common cause of a high or low 2 failure is that the trader is in denial about a trend reversal and is still looking for trades in the direction of the old trend.\nA high or low 2 is one of the most reliable with-trend setups. If a trade fails, the pattern will usually evolve and get either one or two more corrective legs. For example, if the market is moving down in a pullback in a bull trend or in a trading range and forms a high 2, but within a bar or two a bar trades below the low of the signal bar, the high 2 has failed to reverse the market upward out of the bull flag. When that happens, the downswing will usually try to reverse up again in a high 3 or a high 4. The high 3 represents three pushes down and is therefore a variation of a wedge. If the market is more likely to continue lower, you would get stopped out of your long if you bought the high 3. However, if you simply always wait for a high 4, you will miss many good high 3 long trades. The market often gives traders a clue as to which scenario is more likely.

If instead there is a large bear breakout bar or two, this increases the odds that there will be at least two more legs down, and traders should wait for the high 4 before looking to buy. In this case, the breakout bar is likely to become a measuring gap and lead to a measured move down. Whenever there is a strong spike, many traders will start the count over again and will expect at least two more legs down before they are willing to buy again. The reversal up after the first leg is the first attempt to break out above the steep bear trend line and is therefore likely to fail. The second attempt up is the breakout pullback from that breakout, and, since it is a breakout pullback (whether it is a lower low or a higher low), it is more likely to succeed.

However, if there are a couple of large bull trend bars, then the breakout is strong and the market will likely have at least two more legs up, so traders should not short the low 3. Instead, they should wait to see if a low 4 sets up. If the momentum up after the low 3 is very strong, the market is likely in a steep bull channel and it is better not to short the low 4, which is the first breakout of the bottom of a strong bull channel. Instead, traders should wait to see if a higher high or lower high breakout pullback sets up. If so, this is a second-entry short and a lower-risk trade. However, if the bull channel is not very tight and there is some reason to look for a top, such as the low 3 being a small final flag or a second attempt to reverse down after moving above a swing high or a reversal from a higher time frame bear trend line, then traders can short the low 4. Low 4 signal bars are often small, and when they are, the market often quickly reverses up and runs the protective stops above the low 4 signal bar, and then once again reverses down into a good bear swing. Because of this, when there is a small low 4 or high 4 signal bar, use a money management stop of about two points in the Emini instead of a price action stop beyond the signal bar.\nThe key to understanding the concept of high/low 2 setups is to remember its intent. The idea is that the market will tend to make two attempts at anything, and in its attempt to correct, it frequently will try twice to reverse the trend. The advantage of buying a high 2 pullback in a bull trend is that there is very little thought involved and it is easy to do. The difficulty comes when a correction has two attempts but does not form a clear high or low 2.

When there are problems with a setup, it is better to wait.\nWhy wasn't bar 10 a good high 1 long setup? Because it was after a buy climax at the end of a bull leg and final flag (bar 8) and the market was\nlikely to correct sideways to down for about 10 bars or more in two or more legs. Whenever there is a relatively large bull trend bar after the market\nhas been trending up for a while, it might represent a temporary exhaustion in the trend. If a trend might be exhausted, it is no longer a strong bull\ntrend and therefore a high 1 is not a good buy setup. This is also the reason why bar 11 was not a good buy setup. Since the market was still in the\nprocess of correcting after the buy climax, it was in a trading range phase and it is risky to buy a high 2 above the moving average in a trading\nrange.\nBar 17 was a better high 2 long setup. It was the end of a complex two-legged correction where each leg subdivided into two legs, and the larger\nlegs were of similar size and the small legs were of similar size, so the shape was good. Also, although in hindsight the market had converted into a\nbear trend, at this point there was still enough two-sided trading to consider it a trading range and therefore buying a high 2 was reasonable. The\nlarger second leg down began at bar 14 and ended at bar 17, and the high 2 can be thought of in three ways: as being a high 4, as being a high 2\nof the two larger legs where bar 13 was the high 1 end of the first leg, or as being a high 2 of the two smaller legs where bar 15 was the end of the\nfirst leg.\nAlthough high 1s and low 1s are common, they rarely are good setups except in the strongest trends. Since a high 1 usually occurs near the top\nof a leg, you should buy it only if that leg is in the spike phase of a bull leg. Bar 8 is an example of a good high 1 because it formed in a strong bull\ntrend that had six consecutive bull trend bars and each bull body had little, if any, overlap with the body of the bar before it. Almost all high 1s in bull\nspikes and low 1 pullbacks in bear spikes will be micro trend line breakouts.\nSimilarly, bars 25 and 27 were good low 1 short setups in a bear spike. There was a strong bear trend, a strong bear spike, and no strong sell\nclimax, at least not at bar 24. Sometimes it is more descriptive to call the setup something other than a bar count setup, and bar 27 was a good\nexample. Yes, it was a low 1 in a strong bear trend, but some traders would have been concerned about the strong bar 26 bull reversal bar. They\nwould then have concluded that the bear trend was no longer strong enough to be shorting a low 1. However, they might have wondered if the\nmarket was starting to enter a trading range, because this was the second attempt to reverse up, and they might then have wondered whether bar\n26 might actually be a high 2 at the bottom of an incipient trading range, where bar 24 set up the high 1. They would still have shorted below the bar\n27 low 1, but not because it was a low 1. Instead, they would have shorted it because they saw it as a failed high 2 in a bear trend and they knew\nthat the high 2 would have trapped bulls after that strong bar 26 reversal bar.\nSince the market was in a strong bear trend at bar 25 and you could not buy above the high of the prior bar, you could have shorted above the\nhigh of the prior bar, bar 24, and you could have sold more below bar 25.\nDeeper Discussion of This Chart\nBar 1 in Figure 17.1 was an attempt to be the start of a trend from the open bull trend on a large gap up day, but it failed on the very next bar, which became a bull trap (it trapped\nbulls into a losing trade). Since that bear reversal bar traded above bar 1 and turned down, it can be thought of as a failed high 1. This makes bar 2 a high 2 long setup, but after\nthat bull trap, it was better to wait for a second leg down and at least one good bull body before looking to buy again. Also, the move down to bar 2 was a micro channel and the\nbreakout above the channel would be likely to have a pullback, so it was better to wait for that pullback before looking to buy. Do not worry about unclear bar counting like this;\ninstead, focus on the goal of finding a two-legged pullback to buy. The point that is worth noting here is that on many days when the second bar of the day trades above the first\nand then the market trades down, that second bar often becomes a high 1 in a high 2 buy setup, and you should be ready to buy that high 2 if the setup looks good. Although the\nbar 2 high 2 led to a profitable scalp, it would have been a stronger buy setup if bar 2 had been a bull reversal bar, especially if its low had been below the moving average.\nBar 20 was a two-legged pullback to the moving average (the bull trend bar two bars earlier was the first push up) and therefore a reasonable short setup. However, the market\ntraded above the entry and signal bars two bars later on bar 21. That formed a small third push up that trapped bulls in who bought a failed low 2, and trapped bears out who let\nthemselves get stopped out above the high of the bar 20 short signal bar. This is an example of a wedge bear flag. Whenever the market is below the moving average, traders\nare looking for shorts, and when there are both trapped bears and bulls, the odds of a successful short signal go up. The bulls will stop themselves out, and their selling as\nthey exit their longs will help push the market down further. The bears who were just stopped out will now panic and be willing to chase the market down, adding to the selling\npressure.\nFigure 17.2 High and Low 1 Setups in Trading Ranges\nThe high and low 1 setups in the chart on the left in Figure 17.2 formed within a trading range and were not good trades. Those in the chart on the\nright were in clear bear and bull trends and were great setups. Just because the market has a strong bull spike and a high 1 buy setup does not\nmean that you should buy it, and you should never short a low 1 unless there is a strong bear trend.\nBy bar 7, the market had had five reversals, the range was small, and most of the bars overlapped with prior bars. The day was in a trading range\nand clearly not in a strong bull trend. Two bull trend bars formed a strong spike up from the lower low at bar 5, and it broke above the bar 4 lower\nhigh. Bulls were hoping that the day would break out to the upside and form a bull trend, and it could have, except for market inertia. Trends tend to\nkeep trending and reversals usually fail; trading ranges keep going sideways and breakout attempts usually fail. Bar 7 was a high 1 buy setup after\na strong bull spike, but it was in a trading range day. It also had a doji signal bar, which represents two-sided trading. This is a bad buy setup and,\nin fact, aggressive traders expected it to fail and shorted on a limit order at and above the bar 7 high.\n", "text_clean": "smaller than the first so there might be more to go. When there are problems with a setup, it is better to wait.\nWhy wasn't bar 10 a good high 1 long setup? Because it was after a buy climax at the end of a bull leg and final flag (bar 8) and the market was likely to correct sideways to down for about 10 bars or more in two or more legs. Whenever there is a relatively large bull trend bar after the market has been trending up for a while, it might represent a temporary exhaustion in the trend.

Also, although in hindsight the market had converted into a bear trend, at this point there was still enough two-sided trading to consider it a trading range and therefore buying a high 2 was reasonable. The larger second leg down began at bar 14 and ended at bar 17, and the high 2 can be thought of in three ways: as being a high 4, as being a high 2 of the two larger legs where bar 13 was the high 1 end of the first leg, or as being a high 2 of the two smaller legs where bar 15 was the end of the first leg.\nAlthough high 1s and low 1s are common, they rarely are good setups except in the strongest trends. Since a high 1 usually occurs near the top of a leg, you should buy it only if that leg is in the spike phase of a bull leg. Bar 8 is an example of a good high 1 because it formed in a strong bull trend that had six consecutive bull trend bars and each bull body had little, if any, overlap with the body of the bar before it. Almost all high 1s in bull spikes and low 1 pullbacks in bear spikes will be micro trend line breakouts.\nSimilarly, bars 25 and 27 were good low 1 short setups in a bear spike. There was a strong bear trend, a strong bear spike, and no strong sell climax, at least not at bar 24. Sometimes it is more descriptive to call the setup something other than a bar count setup, and bar 27 was a good example. Yes, it was a low 1 in a strong bear trend, but some traders would have been concerned about the strong bar 26 bull reversal bar. They would then have concluded that the bear trend was no longer strong enough to be shorting a low 1. However, they might have wondered if the market was starting to enter a trading range, because this was the second attempt to reverse up, and they might then have wondered whether bar 26 might actually be a high 2 at the bottom of an incipient trading range, where bar 24 set up the high 1. They would still have shorted below the bar 27 low 1, but not because it was a low 1. Instead, they would have shorted it because they saw it as a failed high 2 in a bear trend and they knew that the high 2 would have trapped bulls after that strong bar 26 reversal bar.\nSince the market was in a strong bear trend at bar 25 and you could not buy above the high of the prior bar, you could have shorted above the high of the prior bar, bar 24, and you could have sold more below bar 25.\nDeeper Discussion of This Chart Bar 1 in Figure 17.1 was an attempt to be the start of a trend from the open bull trend on a large gap up day, but it failed on the very next bar, which became a bull trap (it trapped bulls into a losing trade). Since that bear reversal bar traded above bar 1 and turned down, it can be thought of as a failed high 1. This makes bar 2 a high 2 long setup, but after that bull trap, it was better to wait for a second leg down and at least one good bull body before looking to buy again. Also, the move down to bar 2 was a micro channel and the breakout above the channel would be likely to have a pullback, so it was better to wait for that pullback before looking to buy. Do not worry about unclear bar counting like this; instead, focus on the goal of finding a two-legged pullback to buy. The point that is worth noting here is that on many days when the second bar of the day trades above the first and then the market trades down, that second bar often becomes a high 1 in a high 2 buy setup, and you should be ready to buy that high 2 if the setup looks good. Although the bar 2 high 2 led to a profitable scalp, it would have been a stronger buy setup if bar 2 had been a bull reversal bar, especially if its low had been below the moving average.\nBar 20 was a two-legged pullback to the moving average (the bull trend bar two bars earlier was the first push up) and therefore a reasonable short setup. However, the market traded above the entry and signal bars two bars later on bar 21. That formed a small third push up that trapped bulls in who bought a failed low 2, and trapped bears out who let themselves get stopped out above the high of the bar 20 short signal bar. This is an example of a wedge bear flag. Whenever the market is below the moving average, traders are looking for shorts, and when there are both trapped bears and bulls, the odds of a successful short signal go up. The bulls will stop themselves out, and their selling as they exit their longs will help push the market down further. The bears who were just stopped out will now panic and be willing to chase the market down, adding to the selling pressure.\nFigure 17.2 High and Low 1 Setups in Trading Ranges The high and low 1 setups in the chart on the left in Figure 17.2 formed within a trading range and were not good trades. Those in the chart on the right were in clear bear and bull trends and were great setups. Just because the market has a strong bull spike and a high 1 buy setup does not mean that you should buy it, and you should never short a low 1 unless there is a strong bear trend.\nBy bar 7, the market had had five reversals, the range was small, and most of the bars overlapped with prior bars. The day was in a trading range and clearly not in a strong bull trend. Two bull trend bars formed a strong spike up from the lower low at bar 5, and it broke above the bar 4 lower high. Bulls were hoping that the day would break out to the upside and form a bull trend, and it could have, except for market inertia. Trends tend to keep trending and reversals usually fail; trading ranges keep going sideways and breakout attempts usually fail. Bar 7 was a high 1 buy setup after a strong bull spike, but it was in a trading range day. It also had a doji signal bar, which represents two-sided trading.

When\nthe first leg is steep and its correction is only a couple of bars long (like to the bar 2 pause), and then a high 2 setup forms, again after only a bar or\ntwo (like at bar 3), no significant trend line will be broken, so you should not be looking to buy a high 2.

On a 1 minute chart, there was almost certainly a clear leg and small corrective rally that formed these 5\nminute bull trend bars.\nBar 4 was a high 3 long entry bar, but it was also a bear trend bar.

It is exactly where premature longs will exit, and as they sell out of their longs, they add\nto the selling pressure and they will not buy again for at least a bar or two.\nBar 12 was a bull reversal bar and a high 2 (bar 11 was the high 1) in a quiet day and it was the new low of the day, making it a high-probability\ntrade for at least a scalp. If there was no high 1, the move down would have had about six trending bear bars and traders would have to wait for a\nbreakout pullback (a second entry) before considering a long trade. Bar 12 was the end of a measured move (approximately) in a larger two-\nlegged pullback, with the first leg ending at bar 10, and the end of an even larger measured move from the high of the day with a first leg ending at\nbar 4. Finally, bar 12 was a reversal up from a bear trend channel overshoot. The line is not shown, but it is anchored on the low of the bar before\nbar 10 and was created as a parallel of the bear trend line down from bar 7.\nBar 13 could have been the start of a tight trading range because it was the third consecutive small doji. By two bars later, the tight trading range\nwas clear, so most traders should no longer have been using bar counts for setups. However, experienced traders could view bar 13 as a push\ndown, and the two bear bars over the next four bars as two more pushes down; they could then view this tight trading range as a wedge bull flag\n(discussed in Chapter 18) and then look to buy the breakout, expecting a bull channel after the strong bar 12 bull spike. Since at this point the day\nwas basically in a trading range and this tight trading range was in the middle of the day's range, bar counting was unreliable. However, since there\nhad just been a strong spike up, it was reasonable to look to buy above a bull trend bar, regardless of what the bar count was.\nBar 14 was a low 2, ending the second leg up, with the spike up from bar 12 being the first leg up. It was also a double top bear flag with bar 7\nand therefore the second failed attempt to run to the high of the day. On a trendless day and after a double top bear flag, you should look for two\nlegs down. The first leg ended with the bar 15 high 1, which was followed by two small legs up, ending with the bar 16 low 2 at the moving average.\nThe second leg down ended with the high 2 at bar 17, but bar 17 was a bear trend bar following a bear trend bar, and it followed a first leg down\nto bar 15 that was very strong. It was still a valid buy but the uncertainty resulted in a second-chance entry at the bar 18 high 2. This second entry\ndeveloped because enough traders were sufficiently uncomfortable with the first entry to make them wait for a second setup. It was also an ii\npattern variant based on bodies only. In later chapters, you will learn that it is also a double bottom pullback long setup. Bar 17 formed a double\nbottom with either the bar before or the bar after bar 15, and the sideways bar before bar 18 was the pullback.\nThe low 2 at bar 19 was after strong upward momentum, but it was still a valid short. However, it resulted in a five-tick failure at bar 20 (described\nlater; it means that the move down from bar 19 reached only five ticks and therefore left many shorts still trapped without a scalper's profit).\nBar 20 formed a failed low 2, which trapped shorts and was therefore a good entry, especially when the upward momentum had been strong.\nWhen a failed low 2 occurs, it is usually followed by either a low 3 wedge or a low 4. It was also a high 2 above the moving average and within a\ntrading range, but the market was in the channel phase of a bull spike and channel trend, and therefore it was a with-trend buy setup, even though it\nwas still below the top of the trading range. Spike and channel trends are discussed in Chapter 21 in book 1 on trends.\nSince the bull spike up from bar 20 was so strong, at least two more legs up were likely, and buying the high 1 at bar 21 was a reliable trade. It\nwas possible for this leg down to evolve into a two-legged pullback having a bar with a low below the low of bar 21 (forming a high 2 buy setup), but\nthe odds were against it. There was simply too much strength.\nFigure 17.4 The SDS Is Helpful in Analyzing the SPY\nOn the left in Figure 17.4 is the 5 minute Emini and on the right is the 5 minute SDS, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is the inverse of the SPY\n(an ETF that is comparable to the Emini) but has twice the leverage. On the Emini chart, there was a high 2 at bar 5 following a bull trend line break\nat bar 1 and then a higher high at bar 3 that tested the old trend high. This was a possible trend reversal. The downward momentum was strong and\nthe high 1 at bar 4 was weak. It poked above the small bull micro trend line from the bar 3 high and immediately reversed down, indicating that the\nbulls were weak, not strong. It would have been unwise to buy the high 2 at bar 5 unless it showed exceptional strength, like having a strong bull\nreversal signal bar and not having a two-bar bear spike just before it. Also, the signal bar was too large, forcing a trader to buy high in a weak\nmarket, and the signal bar was a doji bar that was almost entirely within the prior two bars (both were bear trend bars).\nWhen there are three or more bars with a lot of overlap and one or more is a doji, it is best to wait for more price action before initiating a trade.\nThe bulls and the bears are in balance and any breakout will likely fail (like the high 2 buy signal at bar 5), and you certainly shouldn't be buying a\nbreakout above its high, in particular in a bear leg, especially since most trading ranges are with the trend and the prior leg was down.\nWhenever you are wondering if a signal is strong enough, it is helpful to study the chart from different perspectives, like using a bar chart or an\ninverse chart. In general, just the fact that you feel that you need further study should tell you that it is not a clear and strong signal and therefore you\nshould not take the trade.\nEven if you were tempted to buy the high 2 on the Emini chart, virtually no one would be looking to sell the bar 5 low 2 on the SDS chart on the\nright, because the upward momentum was so strong.

However, in the absence of any bullish strength in the high 1, 2, or\n3, you should not take the trade. A bar count alone is not sufficient.

If there was no high 1, the move down would have had about six trending bear bars and traders would have to wait for a breakout pullback (a second entry) before considering a long trade. Bar 12 was the end of a measured move (approximately) in a larger twolegged pullback, with the first leg ending at bar 10, and the end of an even larger measured move from the high of the day with a first leg ending at bar 4. Finally, bar 12 was a reversal up from a bear trend channel overshoot. The line is not shown, but it is anchored on the low of the bar before bar 10 and was created as a parallel of the bear trend line down from bar 7.\nBar 13 could have been the start of a tight trading range because it was the third consecutive small doji. By two bars later, the tight trading range was clear, so most traders should no longer have been using bar counts for setups. However, experienced traders could view bar 13 as a push down, and the two bear bars over the next four bars as two more pushes down; they could then view this tight trading range as a wedge bull flag (discussed in Chapter 18) and then look to buy the breakout, expecting a bull channel after the strong bar 12 bull spike. Since at this point the day was basically in a trading range and this tight trading range was in the middle of the day's range, bar counting was unreliable. However, since there had just been a strong spike up, it was reasonable to look to buy above a bull trend bar, regardless of what the bar count was.\nBar 14 was a low 2, ending the second leg up, with the spike up from bar 12 being the first leg up. It was also a double top bear flag with bar 7 and therefore the second failed attempt to run to the high of the day. On a trendless day and after a double top bear flag, you should look for two legs down. The first leg ended with the bar 15 high 1, which was followed by two small legs up, ending with the bar 16 low 2 at the moving average.\nThe second leg down ended with the high 2 at bar 17, but bar 17 was a bear trend bar following a bear trend bar, and it followed a first leg down to bar 15 that was very strong. It was still a valid buy but the uncertainty resulted in a second-chance entry at the bar 18 high 2. This second entry developed because enough traders were sufficiently uncomfortable with the first entry to make them wait for a second setup. It was also an ii pattern variant based on bodies only. In later chapters, you will learn that it is also a double bottom pullback long setup. Bar 17 formed a double bottom with either the bar before or the bar after bar 15, and the sideways bar before bar 18 was the pullback.\nThe low 2 at bar 19 was after strong upward momentum, but it was still a valid short. However, it resulted in a five-tick failure at bar 20 (described later; it means that the move down from bar 19 reached only five ticks and therefore left many shorts still trapped without a scalper's profit).\nBar 20 formed a failed low 2, which trapped shorts and was therefore a good entry, especially when the upward momentum had been strong.\nWhen a failed low 2 occurs, it is usually followed by either a low 3 wedge or a low 4. It was also a high 2 above the moving average and within a trading range, but the market was in the channel phase of a bull spike and channel trend, and therefore it was a with-trend buy setup, even though it was still below the top of the trading range. Spike and channel trends are discussed in Chapter 21 in book 1 on trends.\nSince the bull spike up from bar 20 was so strong, at least two more legs up were likely, and buying the high 1 at bar 21 was a reliable trade. It was possible for this leg down to evolve into a two-legged pullback having a bar with a low below the low of bar 21 (forming a high 2 buy setup), but the odds were against it. There was simply too much strength.\nFigure 17.4 The SDS Is Helpful in Analyzing the SPY On the left in Figure 17.4 is the 5 minute Emini and on the right is the 5 minute SDS, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is the inverse of the SPY (an ETF that is comparable to the Emini) but has twice the leverage. On the Emini chart, there was a high 2 at bar 5 following a bull trend line break at bar 1 and then a higher high at bar 3 that tested the old trend high. This was a possible trend reversal. The downward momentum was strong and the high 1 at bar 4 was weak. It poked above the small bull micro trend line from the bar 3 high and immediately reversed down, indicating that the bulls were weak, not strong. It would have been unwise to buy the high 2 at bar 5 unless it showed exceptional strength, like having a strong bull reversal signal bar and not having a two-bar bear spike just before it. Also, the signal bar was too large, forcing a trader to buy high in a weak market, and the signal bar was a doji bar that was almost entirely within the prior two bars (both were bear trend bars).\nWhen there are three or more bars with a lot of overlap and one or more is a doji, it is best to wait for more price action before initiating a trade.\nThe bulls and the bears are in balance and any breakout will likely fail (like the high 2 buy signal at bar 5), and you certainly shouldn't be buying a breakout above its high, in particular in a bear leg, especially since most trading ranges are with the trend and the prior leg was down.\nWhenever you are wondering if a signal is strong enough, it is helpful to study the chart from different perspectives, like using a bar chart or an inverse chart.

There was a strong bull trend bar spike and then a tight channel up to\nbar 1; the entire move was likely a bull spike on a higher time frame chart. When the momentum is strong like this, the odds favor at least a second leg up after a pullback, and\nthat made it reasonable to look for buy setups once the market pulled back to the area of the bar 2 start of the bull channel.\nThis was also a trend from the open bull day, and bar 2 was the setup for the first pullback long. Bar 3 was a breakout pullback buy setup from the breakout of the bull flag from\nbar 1 to bar 2.\nTraders saw the entire leg down from bar 6 as likely a pullback in a bull trend. The high 2 was close enough for that bottom but traders were not sure. In any case, they were\nlooking to buy. Also notice that every new low down from the bar 6 high quickly reversed. Traders were buying the new lows, so buyers were active all the way down. Although\nthe move down from the failed high 2 was strong, it was three bear bars of increasing size and was a small sell climax. A trader could buy above bar 9 and assume that the bar\n9 low would hold (the wedge low), but it was better to wait for a pullback, which came with the bar 10 higher low. This led to a strong rally into the close as the bulls from the\nopen resumed their buying.\nFigure 17.10 High 2 Variant\nIn Figure 17.10, the bar 16 doji had a large tail on the top, which indicates that the market moved up and down within that bar. That up move was\nthe end of the first leg down, and therefore bar 17 should act like a high 2, which it did.\nBar 12 was a low 2 short setup below the moving average, but the market was beginning to form a trading range and therefore this was not a\nreliable short. In fact, it made more sense to buy at the bar 12 low, but this is something that only experienced traders should attempt. Whenever\nthere is a sell signal just below the moving average and the signal bar is large and mostly overlaps two or more bars, the market is in a small\ntrading range and shorting at the bottom is usually a losing strategy.\nDeeper Discussion of This Chart\nThe day opened with a large gap down in Figure 17.10 and was therefore a bear breakout. Although bar 1 was a bear trend bar, it could still be the first bar of a trend from the\nopen bull trend day, although this is less likely than if it had been a bull trend bar. Traders bought above the high of bar 1 for the failed breakout rally. The rally went for only two\nbars and then the bears shorted below the second bull bar and below the two-bar reversal (the low of that bear entry bar) for the breakout pullback short and a possible trend\nfrom the open bear day. A large gap down has an increased chance of being a bear trend day, and traders should try to take all reasonable short setups for a swing down.\nBar 4 was the third push down on the day, but it was the third bar of a bear spike and therefore not a reliable signal bar for a long. Traders should wait for a breakout and then a\npullback before going long. The next bar was a bull trend bar that traded above bar 4 and formed a two-bar reversal, but the market did not trade above the top of the two bars; it\ninstead broke out to the downside. The three bear bars before bar 2 had enough momentum so that many traders would restart the count and would consider bar 2 to be the\nfirst push down.\nWhen bar 4 formed, some traders saw it as the third push down whereas others saw it as only the second, and no one knew which group of traders would be correct. When in\ndoubt, stay out and wait for a second signal.\nBar 5 was a bull reversal bar and the second bar of a two-bar reversal; it was also the third push down in the channel that began with the bar 2 bear spike. The spike is often\nthe first push, as it was here. At this point, the spike and channel bulls bought, expecting two pushes up, and the wedge traders who reset the count with the bar 2 spike also\nbought this third push down. The traders who wondered if bar 4 was the third push were looking for a breakout pullback and saw bar 5 as a lower low breakout pullback. All\ntraders at this point believed that all of these factors were at play and the odds were good for a two-legged rally.\nBar 5 was followed by a four-bar bull spike up to the moving average, and this might have been the end of the first leg up.\nBar 6 was a setup for a low 2 short but since a second leg up was likely, it was better not to take a short scalp and instead look for a lower high long setup or a breakout of this\nbull flag. Bar 6 and two bars before it were bear bars forming two small legs down; they therefore set up a high 2 buy above the high of bar 6.\nBar 8 was a small doji, but it might have been a setup for a final flag short for a failed breakout of that four-bar bull flag that ended with bar 6. However, the move up to bar 8 from\nbar 5 was in a fairly tight bull channel, and therefore it was unclear if bar 8 was the second leg up. When in doubt, wait for a second signal. The bar after bar 8 was a bear trend\nbar, which was a good entry bar for the bears who shorted, but they would buy back their shorts above the bear trend bar. Many traders went long above bar 6 since there were\ntrapped bears and this was also now a failed low 2, where bar 6 was the first push down.\nBar 9 was a bear reversal bar, a second-signal moving average gap bar where bar 8 was the first setup, and the top of a bear wedge. The top of the spike up from bar 5 was the\nfirst push up, and bar 8 was the second. A wedge reversal usually has at least two legs down, and it did here. The first ended at bar 11 and the second at bar 17.

There was a strong bull trend bar spike and then a tight channel up to bar 1; the entire move was likely a bull spike on a higher time frame chart. When the momentum is strong like this, the odds favor at least a second leg up after a pullback, and that made it reasonable to look for buy setups once the market pulled back to the area of the bar 2 start of the bull channel.\nThis was also a trend from the open bull day, and bar 2 was the setup for the first pullback long. Bar 3 was a breakout pullback buy setup from the breakout of the bull flag from bar 1 to bar 2.\nTraders saw the entire leg down from bar 6 as likely a pullback in a bull trend. The high 2 was close enough for that bottom but traders were not sure. In any case, they were looking to buy. Also notice that every new low down from the bar 6 high quickly reversed. Traders were buying the new lows, so buyers were active all the way down.

A trader could buy above bar 9 and assume that the bar 9 low would hold (the wedge low), but it was better to wait for a pullback, which came with the bar 10 higher low. This led to a strong rally into the close as the bulls from the open resumed their buying.\nFigure 17.10 High 2 Variant In Figure 17.10, the bar 16 doji had a large tail on the top, which indicates that the market moved up and down within that bar. That up move was the end of the first leg down, and therefore bar 17 should act like a high 2, which it did.\nBar 12 was a low 2 short setup below the moving average, but the market was beginning to form a trading range and therefore this was not a reliable short. In fact, it made more sense to buy at the bar 12 low, but this is something that only experienced traders should attempt. Whenever there is a sell signal just below the moving average and the signal bar is large and mostly overlaps two or more bars, the market is in a small trading range and shorting at the bottom is usually a losing strategy.\nDeeper Discussion of This Chart The day opened with a large gap down in Figure 17.10 and was therefore a bear breakout. Although bar 1 was a bear trend bar, it could still be the first bar of a trend from the open bull trend day, although this is less likely than if it had been a bull trend bar. Traders bought above the high of bar 1 for the failed breakout rally. The rally went for only two bars and then the bears shorted below the second bull bar and below the two-bar reversal (the low of that bear entry bar) for the breakout pullback short and a possible trend from the open bear day. A large gap down has an increased chance of being a bear trend day, and traders should try to take all reasonable short setups for a swing down.\nBar 4 was the third push down on the day, but it was the third bar of a bear spike and therefore not a reliable signal bar for a long. Traders should wait for a breakout and then a pullback before going long. The next bar was a bull trend bar that traded above bar 4 and formed a two-bar reversal, but the market did not trade above the top of the two bars; it instead broke out to the downside. The three bear bars before bar 2 had enough momentum so that many traders would restart the count and would consider bar 2 to be the first push down.\nWhen bar 4 formed, some traders saw it as the third push down whereas others saw it as only the second, and no one knew which group of traders would be correct. When in doubt, stay out and wait for a second signal.\nBar 5 was a bull reversal bar and the second bar of a two-bar reversal; it was also the third push down in the channel that began with the bar 2 bear spike. The spike is often the first push, as it was here. At this point, the spike and channel bulls bought, expecting two pushes up, and the wedge traders who reset the count with the bar 2 spike also bought this third push down. The traders who wondered if bar 4 was the third push were looking for a breakout pullback and saw bar 5 as a lower low breakout pullback. All traders at this point believed that all of these factors were at play and the odds were good for a two-legged rally.\nBar 5 was followed by a four-bar bull spike up to the moving average, and this might have been the end of the first leg up.\nBar 6 was a setup for a low 2 short but since a second leg up was likely, it was better not to take a short scalp and instead look for a lower high long setup or a breakout of this bull flag. Bar 6 and two bars before it were bear bars forming two small legs down; they therefore set up a high 2 buy above the high of bar 6.\nBar 8 was a small doji, but it might have been a setup for a final flag short for a failed breakout of that four-bar bull flag that ended with bar 6. However, the move up to bar 8 from bar 5 was in a fairly tight bull channel, and therefore it was unclear if bar 8 was the second leg up. When in doubt, wait for a second signal. The bar after bar 8 was a bear trend bar, which was a good entry bar for the bears who shorted, but they would buy back their shorts above the bear trend bar. Many traders went long above bar 6 since there were trapped bears and this was also now a failed low 2, where bar 6 was the first push down.\nBar 9 was a bear reversal bar, a second-signal moving average gap bar where bar 8 was the first setup, and the top of a bear wedge. The top of the spike up from bar 5 was the first push up, and bar 8 was the second. A wedge reversal usually has at least two legs down, and it did here. The first ended at bar 11 and the second at bar 17.

Bar 7 was the signal bar for the short on the following\nbar, even though it was a lower entry than the low 1. It was still a two-legged correction.\nBar 8 was a small bear inside bar in an upward correction, and it therefore constituted a tiny correction, ending the first leg up. Bar 9 followed\nanother bull trend bar (actually two), so it was the second attempt down and effectively a low 2 short near the moving average.\nBar 11 was lower than bar 10, so it was the start of the move up to bar 12. Why was the bar after the bar 12 top a low 2? The low of the bar 12\nbull outside bar dipped below the prior bar just after bar 12 opened, although you cannot tell from this chart, but you can tell for certain by looking at\na 1 minute chart (not shown). This made bar 12 a low 1. An outside bar breaks out of both sides of its prior bar; you do not know which side it broke\nthrough first, although the direction of its body is usually reliable (for example, a bull body usually indicates that the upside breakout occurred\nsecond, since its direction is up into its close). The bar after bar 12 broke below bar 12, so it was the second time in this leg up from bar 11 that a\nbar broke below the low of the prior bar and was therefore a low 2 short at the moving average. Bar 12 was also a low 2 short setup because bar 9\nwas a first move up and bar 12 was a second move up.\nBar 13 was a low 1 short entry bar (and a low 2 where the bear bar three bars earlier was the low 1), but after two strong bull trend bars, this was\ntoo risky to take since more of an upward correction was likely.\nOnce there was a second leg up (bar 14 had a higher high, so it was clearly a small second leg), any bar that had a low below the prior bar was a\nlow 2 short. Bar 15 turned into a low 2 short signal bar even though it was a small swing high that was below the high of the two legs up (it was a\nlower high in what should be expected to be at least two legs down).

This made shorting\nhere risky, and it was likely that there would be more buyers below the bar than sellers. The more certain you are that the market is in a tight trading\nrange, the less certain you will be about your bar counting. In general, it is better not to take trades based on bar counts in tight trading ranges\nunless you are very confident with your count, which means that you believe that the count is clear enough to warrant a trade.\nBar 18 was a double bottom with bar 16 and a high 2 based on the two small pushes down from bar 17.\nDeeper Discussion of This Chart\nAs shown in Figure 17.12, the day had a large gap down and was therefore a bear breakout. The first bar was a bear trend bar and a possible high of the day; consequently, it\nwas an acceptable short setup. However, the market reversed up into a failed breakout long setup on the next bar, and the day could have become a trend from the open bull\ntrend day. The large gap down still favored the bears unless the bulls clearly took control of the market with a strong bull spike and follow-through.\nOnce the market traded below bar 2, the market then had both a spike down and a spike up after the first bar of the day, and the day's range was less than a third of the recent\naverage daily range. This put the opening range in breakout mode for a possible trend day, and traders placed buy stops above the high of the day to go long on the upside\nbreakout, and sell stops to go short below the bar 1 low spike for a downside breakout. The large bear trend bar that broke below bar 1 shows how aggressively the traders\nshorted. The sell-off was probably attributed to a 7:00 a.m. PST report. However, it is more likely that the institutions were already planning to short today and very unlikely that\nthey were flooded with phone calls from their large clients who heard the bearish report and now suddenly decided to sell. The institutions were already looking to short but\nwere hoping for a rally on the report so that they could short higher. The report convinced them that they were not going to get that rally so they had to short after the report, and\nthey continued to short all day long.\nBar 18 was the end of a bear trend bar breakout of a tight trading range and likely to reverse up because of the magnetic pull of tight trading ranges, which often become final\nflags.\nBar 19 was the first moving average gap bar in a bear trend and therefore a good short. It is a good example of a bear trap that often occurs in the final hour or two of a bear\ntrend day. It was at the top of a strong bull spike that broke above the bar 17 swing high and trapped bulls in and bears out. All bull spikes are climaxes and breakouts, and they\nsometimes fail and lead to reversals down instead of reversals up. At the time the spike was forming, emotional traders who were afraid that they were missing a major\nreversal bought as that second bull trend bar formed, as it broke above the bar 17 lower high, and as the bar closed on its high. Strong bears were simply stepping aside and\nletting the bulls go. These bears knew that the odds were high that there would be an attempted bull reversal before the day was over, and they waited for a strong bull trend bar\nto form. Once they saw it, they believed that the market would not hold up there very long, so they aggressively shorted. Since both they and the bulls knew that the bears\ncontrolled the day, the bears were confident of being able to again drive the market to a new low of the day. The bulls scalped out of their longs because they did not believe that\nthe reversal up had enough of the ingredients of a strong bull reversal. There was no prior strong break of the bear trend line, and the market was unable to hold above the\nmoving average at any point in the day.\nFigure 17.13 A Spike and Channel Is a Two-Legged Move\n", "text_clean": "The chart of the SPY presented in Figure 17.12 demonstrates lots of variations in low 2 setups, but if you think about each one, each was the logical end of a two-legged bear correction.

It is often contained between a converging\ntrend line and trend channel line. When this is the case and it is horizontal, it is a triangle, which can break out in either direction. However, when it\nis falling in a bull trend or rising in a bear trend, it is called a wedge, and, like all pullbacks, it will usually break out in the direction of the trend. Like\nother types of triangles, it has at least five legs, but unlike a typical triangle, the second leg often exceeds the prior swing point. It can be just a\nsimple three-push wedge pattern or a channel after a spike. It can also assume an irregular shape that looks nothing like a wedge but has three\ncountertrend pushes, which is all that is needed to qualify as a triangle, or, if it is sloping, a wedge type of triangle, or simply a wedge.\nA wedge pullback is a with-trend setup, and traders can enter on the first signal, as soon as the market reverses back into the direction of the\ntrend. Wedges can also be reliable reversal patterns, but unlike a wedge pullback, a wedge reversal is a countertrend setup and it is therefore\nusually better to wait for a second entry. For example, unless a wedge top is extremely strong, traders should wait for the bear breakout and then\nassess its strength. If it is strong, they can then look to see if there is a breakout pullback short setup, which they can short. The pullback can come\nas either a higher high or a lower high. If the breakout is weak, traders should expect it to fail and then look for a buy setup, so they can enter on the\nfailed bear breakout for a resumption of the bull trend.\nIf a wedge reversal forms in a bull trend, the wedge is pointed up, unlike a wedge pullback in a bull trend, which is pointed down. A wedge bottom\nin a bear trend is pointed down, unlike a wedge bear flag, which is pointed up. Also, wedge flags are usually smaller patterns and most last about\n10 to 20 bars.

Remember, a wedge is usually the end of a trend, and a pullback is a small trend (but it is in the opposite direction of the larger trend),\nso it makes sense to view a wedge pullback as similar to a wedge reversal. In general, if a wedge is sloping up and to the right, whether it is a\npullback in a bear trend or a top in a bull trend, it can be thought of as a bear flag even if there was no prior bear trend, since it will usually break out\nto the downside. This is because the behavior of its breakout and the follow-through after the breakout are indistinguishable from those of bear\nflags in strong bear trends.

It is a short-term trend (a pullback) ending at the long-term trend's support\n(in a bull trend) or resistance (in a bear trend). All pullbacks end in dueling lines patterns, although the support or resistance line is not always\nobvious. Any type of support or resistance can be the area where strong hands will come in and put an end to the pullback. Whenever traders see a\npullback approaching a trend line, a trend channel line, a moving average, a prior swing low or high, or any other key price level, they should be alert\nfor a setup that will lead to the end of the pullback and the resumption of the trend. When they see the setup, they are in a position to make a great\ntrade. Remember, trading is becoming increasingly controlled by mathematics, and pullbacks end for a reason. A pullback in a bull trend always\nends at a support level, and a pullback in a bear trend always ends at a resistance level, and therefore all pullbacks are dueling lines patterns.\nHowever, I reserve the term for those pullbacks where the support or resistance is seen by the trader, so that he can anticipate the possible trend\nresumption and place a trade. The most reliable form is when the pullback is in a channel and it has a wedge shape or three pushes, and the signal\nbar for the end of the pullback is a bar that pokes through the trend line and reverses. For example, if there is a bull trend and it is having a wedge\nbull flag pullback that is ending at the bull trend line, the trend channel line below the wedge bull flag is falling and it is intersecting the rising bull\ntrend line exactly as the pullback is setting up a buy signal. The support line could be a horizontal line, like across a prior swing low, and this could\nset up a double bottom buy signal as the wedge is ending. The support could also come in the form of the moving average. When this happens,\nlook to enter in the direction of the trend if there is an adequate setup.\nAs another example, look at a bear channel to see if there is a leg up within the channel. If so, look to see if that leg has three pushes. If the small\nbear rally is testing the bear trend line as it is also testing the trend channel line drawn across its highs, the odds are good that the leg up will end\nand the market will reverse down to test the lower end of the channel. If the market does turn down at this point, it is doing so because of the\nsimultaneous testing of two resistance lines, even though one is rising and the other is falling, and having two types of resistance affecting the\nmarket at the same time increases the chance of a profitable trade.\nFigure 19.1 Dueling Lines Pullback\nAll pullbacks end in dueling lines patterns, even if the long-term support is not readily seen. A pullback is a small trend in the opposite direction from\nthe larger trend. All pullbacks always end for a reason, and a bull pullback always ends at some longer-term support, like a trend line, a measured\nmove, or a prior swing high or low. In Figure 19.1, a bear trend channel line drawn between bars 3 and 5 created support for bar 6. All swing points\nshould be considered when drawing trend lines and trend channel lines, even those from a prior trend. Bar 3 was a swing low in a bull trend, and\nbar 5 was a swing low in the correction of a possible new bear trend. The move down to bar 6 became just a large two-legged correction in the bull\nmarket. There were dueling lines at bar 6 (a bull trend line and a bear trend channel line of opposite slopes) and the market reversed up at the\nintersection, as is common. Since the move down to bar 6 was steep, it was reasonable to wait for the second entry at the bar 7 higher low, buying\non a stop at one tick over its high.\nA bear trend channel line could also have been based on a trend line drawn across the two swing highs that followed the bar 4 high, and then\nanchored to bar 5. The goal is to look at the overall shape and then choose any trend channel line that contains the price action. Then, watch how\nthe market reacts after penetrating the line.\nDeeper Discussion of This Chart\nBar 6 was a wedge bull flag in Figure 19.1.

The same is true for double tops\nand bottoms. For example, if there is a head and shoulders top in a bull market, a breakout below the neckline will usually fail and the market will\nmost likely then reverse up and have a with-trend breakout to the upside, above the right shoulder. The pattern becomes a triangle if it is mostly\nhorizontal or a wedge bull flag if it is slightly sloping down. The three pushes down are the down legs after the left shoulder, the head, and the right\nshoulder. The right shoulder is an attempt to form a lower high after the move down from the head breaks the bull trend line. Since the move down\nfrom the head usually breaks below the bull trend line, the right shoulder becomes a lower high breakout pullback. Also, if there is a bear market\nthat is forming a trading range and that trading range assumes the shape of a head and shoulders top, a break below the neckline is a with-trend\nbreakout of a bear flag and is likely to lead to lower prices.\nSimilarly, head and shoulders bottoms also are with-trend setups.

They exited their positions and did not\nwant to buy again until after a significant pullback. With a large block of buyers out of the market, short sellers took control and drove the market\ndown. As so often happens, when traders want to buy a pullback, the pullback is so deep and violent that they change their minds, and this absence\nof buying sometimes causes the selling to accelerate. The cause is obviously much more complicated than this because there are countless\nparticipants acting for countless reasons, but this is a component.\nThe market often finds support in the area of the previous low.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 132, "text_raw": "Part IV\nTrading Ranges\nThe broadest and most useful definition of a trading range is that it is simply an area of two-sided trading. It can be as small as a single bar (a doji\nbar) or larger than all of the bars on your screen. It can be mostly horizontal, which indicates that the bulls and bears are in balance, or it can be\nslightly sloping. If it slopes up, the bulls are more aggressive. If it slopes down, the bears are stronger. If it slopes too much, it should be considered\nto be a trend channel and not a trading range. It can have very large swings lasting many bars or it can be very tight with each swing lasting only a\nbar or so, creating a narrow channel. When it is horizontal, the lines that contain it are support and resistance lines, with the support line below and\nthe resistance line above.\nThe term trading range is usually applied to any section of a chart that is not trending and is mostly horizontal, but using the broader definition is\nmore useful to traders because once you know that there is two-sided trading, you can look for opportunities to trade in both directions. Many\nbeginners are too eager to look for reversals and can't resist trading them before the market is likely enough to transition from a trend to a trading\nrange. However, once there is enough evidence that the transition is taking place, there are often high probability countertrend scalp and even\nswing setups. The key is to wait for enough evidence before taking them. Some patterns are usually not thought of as trading ranges but actually fit\nthe broader definition of any area of the chart where there is two-sided trading taking place, which is most of the time. A trend has brief spikes\nwhere there is little two-sided trading, but most of the price action in a trend has some two-sided trading taking place and is therefore some type of\ntrading range.\nA pullback is a trading range where traders believe that the trend will soon resume. A traditional trading range is an area where there is\nuncertainty and the trend could resume or reverse, but most attempts to break out fail. A rising channel in a bull and a falling channel in a bear are\nsloping trading ranges, since both have two-sided trading, but the trend traders are more aggressive than the countertrend traders. They are also\nthe first leg in a trading range that is not yet evident. For example, after the market spikes up in a strong series of large bull trend bars with only\nsmall tails and very little overlap, it soon enters a phase where there is more overlap of the bars, larger tails, some bear bodies, a shallower slope,\nand some pullbacks, even if they last for only a single bar. This is a bull channel, but all channels are basically trading ranges because they\nrepresent two-sided trading. If the channel is steeply up and the pullbacks are small, the bears are there but are getting overwhelmed by the bulls. A\nchannel is made of a series of small trading ranges, each followed by a small breakout that leads to another small trading range. As the channel\nmatures, the swings become larger as the bulls become less aggressive and the bears more aggressive. There will be a break below the channel\nand then usually a test to the bottom of the channel. At that point, the market had a leg up (the bull channel) and a leg down (the test of the bottom of\nthe channel), and most traders will see the overall pattern as a trading range. It might form a double bottom bull flag or, at some point, the bears will\ntake control and there will be a spike down and the process will reverse.\nHere are some characteristics that are commonly found in trading ranges:\nThere is a sense of uncertainty about the direction of the impending breakout. In fact, uncertainty is the hallmark of a trading range;\nwhenever most traders are uncertain, the market is in a trading range (trends have a sense of certainty and urgency). Usually, however, a\ntrading range is ultimately a trend resumption setup, which means that it is just pullback on a higher time frame chart.\nAlmost all of the trades look like they are no more than 55 percent certain.\nThere are both legitimate bull and bear setups forming at the same time.\nThere are several changes in direction on your screen.\nThe overall price action is mostly horizontal, with the bars on the left and right edges of the screen in the middle third of the screen\nvertically.\nMost of the bars are in the middle of the screen, and there are sharp reversals near the top and bottom.\nThe market runs stops repeatedly, often with strong trend bars, but then reverses direction on the next bar. For example, the market will\nhave two bear trend bars that fall below a strong swing low, but then the market reverses up on the next bar.\nThere are many bull and bear trend bars but few instances where there are three or four consecutive bull trend bars or bear trend bars.\nMany bars have prominent tails.\nMany bars overlap 50 percent or more of the bar before.\nThere are many areas where there are three or more bars that each overlap by 50 percent or more of the range of the prior bars.\nThere are many dojis, which can be large or small.\nThe moving average is relatively flat.\nThe price action off the screen to the left was also in a trading range.\nThere was just an impressive buy or sell climax.\nThe vacuum effect is present, resulting in strong bull spikes at the top and strong bear spikes at the bottom, with both failing to break out\nand instead reversing back into the range.\nMany legs subdivide into two smaller legs and then reverse into a two-legged move in the opposite direction.\nLow 1 and low 2 short setups at the bottom and high 1 and high 2 buy setups at the top usually fail.\nSignal bars often look weak, even for second entries.\nAny area of two-sided trading, even if it lasts for only a single bar, is a trading range. When you refer to a trading range as a pullback, you believe\nthat the odds are favorable that the trend will soon resume and you will, therefore, likely be taking trades only in the direction of the trend. Every\ntrader will have different criteria, but, in general, if you are about 60 percent or more certain that your trade will soon be followed by a resumption of\nthe trend, then you believe that the pattern is a pullback. If instead you are less certain that your trade will be followed by a breakout, then the pattern\nis a trading range. A trading range is just a pullback that has lasted so long that it has lost its short-term predictive power, and 80 percent of the\nbreakout attempts up or down will fail. If you buy near the bottom, the market will probably trade to the top, but instead of breaking out, there will be\na sell setup and the market will return to the area of your long entry. If you short near the top, the market will probably trade down far enough to scalp\na profit, but then rally back again to around your entry price.

It can be as small as a single bar (a doji bar) or larger than all of the bars on your screen. It can be mostly horizontal, which indicates that the bulls and bears are in balance, or it can be slightly sloping. If it slopes up, the bulls are more aggressive. If it slopes down, the bears are stronger. If it slopes too much, it should be considered to be a trend channel and not a trading range. It can have very large swings lasting many bars or it can be very tight with each swing lasting only a bar or so, creating a narrow channel. When it is horizontal, the lines that contain it are support and resistance lines, with the support line below and the resistance line above.\nThe term trading range is usually applied to any section of a chart that is not trending and is mostly horizontal, but using the broader definition is more useful to traders because once you know that there is two-sided trading, you can look for opportunities to trade in both directions. Many beginners are too eager to look for reversals and can't resist trading them before the market is likely enough to transition from a trend to a trading range. However, once there is enough evidence that the transition is taking place, there are often high probability countertrend scalp and even swing setups.

Although you can trade it as a pullback on a higher time\nframe chart, most traders find it easier to make money if they watch and trade only a single chart, even though they are aware of setups on higher\nand lower time frame charts.\nWith a pullback, you should usually look to trade only in the direction of the trend, unless the pullback is likely to be large enough for a\ncountertrend scalp. Most traders should still wait for the with-trend setup because countertrend scalping is a losing strategy for everyone except the\nmost experienced traders. If you trade countertrend, you should do so only if you believe that the market will enter a trading range instead of just a\npullback. With a trading range, you can trade in both directions, knowing that most breakout attempts up and down will fail. However, if there is a\nparticularly strong setup at the bottom of a trading range in a bull market, you can consider swinging all or just part of your trade. Likewise, if there is\na strong sell setup at the top of a trading range that followed a strong bear trend, you should swing part or all of your short position.\nThe final leg down in most trading ranges in bull markets is a bear channel, which is a last-ditch attempt by the bears to create a top and a new\nbear trend. A bear channel is a bull flag. Bulls can buy the reversal up from the bottom of the trading range or on the breakout pullback that usually\nfollows soon afterward. When the trading range is in a bull market, the rallies tend to be stronger than the pullbacks, especially as the trading range\nnears its end. In addition, each pullback functions as a flag. The next rally is a breakout from that bull flag, and the next pullback is a breakout\npullback setup, as well as another bull flag. One of those bull flags will be the final one, and its breakout will become the next leg up in the\nresumption of the bull trend. Since all trading ranges are pullbacks on higher time frame charts, that breakout will also be the breakout of that higher\ntime frame bull flag. The opposite is true of trading ranges in bear trends, where the final leg is usually a bull channel, which is a bear flag.\nChannels usually eventually evolve into trading ranges, and traders are always looking for the earliest signs of the transitions, because a channel\nis a trend, and traders are less willing to trade against it than they are in a trading range, where traders trade in both directions. Once traders\nbelieve that it has become a trading range, there will be spikes and channels in the opposite direction. Sometimes the trend will reverse (most\nreversal patterns are trading ranges), but more likely, the market will be in a trading range for at least 10 or 20 more bars.\nEvery channel has two-sided trading and is usually the start of a trading range. However, as long as the highs and lows keep trending, the\nchannel is still in effect and the market has not yet converted to a trading range. For example, in a rising channel, the bulls will buy all pullbacks\naggressively when the market gets near the most recent higher low, because they want everyone to see the market as still in a channel, which is a\ntype of bull trend, and not in a trading range. This will make other traders more likely to buy, the rally more likely to continue, and their profit grow.\nSometimes the market will fall below a minor higher low and find buyers. This new low is the basis for a new, flatter trend line (from the bottom of the\nchannel) and a less steep, broader channel. It indicates that the price action is becoming more two-sided and therefore more like a trading range,\nbut still in a channel. Once the market clearly enters a trading range, traders will start selling rallies, which will reduce the ability of the bulls to keep\npushing the market higher and limit their ability to profit. As long as they can keep the market trending up, they know that most traders will only look\nto buy. The market will often pull pack to the most recent higher low and set up a double bottom bull flag. This is acceptable to the bulls because\nthey know that it is a bullish setup and that the market will expect about a measured move up if the setup triggers (by trading above the high of the\nsignal bar). At least they then have an idea of how much higher the rally might go, and this will give them a profit-taking target.\nWhen the market is in its spike phase of a trend, it is very one-sided and pullbacks are created by institutions taking profits, not by them trading\nin the opposite direction. As pullbacks get deeper, countertrend traders begin to scalp. Once pullbacks grow into trading ranges, more\ncountertrend traders are scalping and some are scaling into shorts. The with-trend traders become less confident about how much further the trend\ncan go, and they transition from swing trading into more scalping. That is why in a trading range, scalping by both the bulls and bears is dominant.\nBoth are buying low and selling high. The buying at the bottom is being done by bulls initiating longs and bears taking profits, and the selling at the\ntop is by bears shorting and bulls taking profits. Since a trader's job is to follow the institutions, he too should be scalping, and buying near the\nbottom and selling near the top of the range. Whenever the market is in a trading range, traders should immediately think, “Buy low, sell high, and\nscalp.”\nTrading ranges have two-sided trading, where the bulls are stronger near the bottom and the bears are stronger near the top. Every rally in a\ntrading range is essentially a bear flag and every selloff is effectively a bull flag. Because of this, traders trade the top of the range the way they\ntrade a bear flag in a bear trend. They sell above and below bars, and above resistance and below support areas. They sell above bars, including\nstrong bull trend bars, and above every type of resistance, because they see each move up as an attempt to break out of the top of the range, and\nthey know that most breakout attempts fail. They sell below bars and below every type of support, because they see each move down as equivalent\nto a breakout of the bottom of a bear flag in a bear trend. They expect that attempts to break above the trading range will fail, that the bear flag\nbreakouts will succeed, and that the market will soon reverse down and test the bottom of the range.\nThey trade the bottom of the range the way they trade a bull flag in a bull trend. They buy above and below bars, and above resistance and below\nsupport areas. They buy below bars, including strong bear trend bars, and below every type of support, because they see each a move down as an\nattempt to break out of the bottom of the range, and they know that most breakout attempts fail. They buy above bars and above every type of\nresistance, because they see each move up as equivalent to a breakout of the top of a bull flag in a bull trend. They expect that attempts to break\nbelow the trading range will fail, and that the bull flag breakouts will succeed, and that the market will soon reverse up and test the top of the range.\nWhen the chart is trending, the trading ranges are relatively small and better described as pullbacks since they are just brief pauses in the trend\nand are followed by a test of the trend's extreme. If no test comes and the market reverses, what at first appeared to be a pullback has evolved into\na reversal pattern. If the chart is composed of upswings and downswings across the entire screen, then neither the bulls nor the bears are dominant\nand they are alternating control over the market and the chart is then in a trading range. Each swing is a small trend that is potentially tradable,\nespecially on a smaller time frame. On a larger time frame, the trading range will be a pullback in a trend. For example, a 5 minute chart that is a\nlarge trading range will likely be just a pullback in a trend on the 60 minute chart, and a 60 minute trading range will be a pullback on a daily or\nweekly chart.\nMany traders use descriptive names like flags, pennants, or triangles, but the name is irrelevant. All that matters is that two-sided trading is taking\nplace. The market is in breakout mode and at some point it will break out in either direction into another trend. Both the bulls and the bears believe\nthat this price area is an area of good value, and both are initiating trades. Value exits at extremes. The market is either too cheap, as it is at\nsupport, or too expensive, as it is at resistance. The middle of a trading range is also an area of value for both the bulls and the bears, because\nboth see it as an extreme. The bulls believe that the market is bottoming and therefore at a low, and the bears see it as topping and at a high. If the\nmarket drops a little, the bears will sell less and the bulls will become more aggressive at this better, more extreme price. This will tend to lift the\nmarket back toward the middle of the range. If the price goes up near the top of the range, the bulls will buy less, since they will see the market as a\nlittle expensive. The bears, in contrast, will be even more eager to sell at these better prices.\nEven a steep channel represents breakout mode.

The chance of any one breakout being successful is about 20 percent, but the\nchance that the market will eventually break to the upside is about 60 percent. However, it might break to the upside and to the downside several\ntimes before the bull trend resumes, so if traders buy a breakout and do not want to get stopped out, they need to place their protective stops far\nenough below the trading range so that the repeated failed downside breakouts will not stop them out. Few traders are willing to risk that much and\nwait that long, so the majority of them should not buy most trading range breakouts.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 135, "text_raw": "The media makes it sound like traders oscillate between fear and greed. That is probably true for beginners, but not for experienced traders, who\nrarely feel either. Another pair of emotions is much more common with them, and also much more useful: uncertainty and urgency. A trend is an\narea of certainty, or at least relative certainty. Your personal radar can tell you if the market is more likely in a trend instead of a strong leg within a\ntrading range. If you have a sense of uncertainty, the market is more likely in a trading range; if instead you have a sense of urgency and you are\nhoping for a pullback, then the market is more likely in a trend. Every trend is made of a series of spikes and trading ranges, and the spikes are\nbrief. When they exist, there is a directional bias to the probabilities. This means that during a spike in a bull trend, the odds of the market moving X\nticks higher before it moves X ticks lower are more than 50 percent, and can be 70 percent or more if the trend is strong. Both the bulls and the\nbears agree that the market needs to move to a new price level, where uncertainty will return. A trading range is that area of uncertainty, and\nwhenever you are uncertain about the direction of the market, it is likely in a trading range. Within the middle of a trading range, the probability of\nthe market moving up or down X ticks is about 50 percent most of the time. There are brief fluctuations in this probability, but most of them last for\ntoo few ticks to be traded profitably. This search for uncertainty is the basis of measured moves. The market will continue its higher-probability\ndirectional move until the odds fall below 50–50, meaning that a reversal is likely (the odds are greater that the market will now move in the\nopposite direction). Most of the time, that will occur at some area of support or resistance, like a prior swing point or trend line or trend channel line,\nand most of the time it will be in the area of some measured move. The reversal is a move toward what will become the middle of a trading range\nwhere there is a 50 percent chance of the market moving up or down X ticks before it goes X ticks in the opposite direction.\nWhen you are completely neutral about a trading range, the directional probability of an equidistant move is 50 percent, and the market is around\nwhat will become the middle of the range. As the market works toward the top of the range, the odds favor the market going down, and the\ndirectional probability is 60 percent or more that the market will fall X ticks before it goes up X ticks. Near the bottom of the range, that is reversed,\nand the directional probability favors a rally. If there has been a strong bull trend leading up to the range and there has not been a clear top, then\nthere is a directional bias in favor of the bulls, even when the market is in the middle of the trading range. If the trend was very strong, then the\ndirectional probability in the middle of the range might be 53 to 55 percent, although it is impossible to ever be certain. Just be aware that trading\nranges are continuation patterns on higher time frame charts, and if there was a strong bull trend leading up to it and no clear top, the odds of an\nupside breakout are greater. Following a strong bull trend, when the market falls to the bottom of the range, the directional probability of an\nequidistant move is greater than at the bottom of a trading range that formed after a bear trend, so instead of 60 percent in favor of a rally, maybe it\nis 70 to 80 percent. In fact, the odds of a rally that is twice or three times X ticks before a sell-off of X ticks might even be 70 percent or higher. For\nexample, if the trading range is 50 ticks tall and you bought above a bull reversal bar on a two-legged pullback to the bottom of the range, and the\nbar is eight ticks tall, there might be a 70 percent chance of the market rallying 20 or 30 ticks before hitting your stop 10 ticks below your entry.\nLikewise, near the top of the range, the directional probability of an equidistant move is less than in a trading range that followed a bear trend, and\ninstead of a 70 percent to 80 percent chance of the market falling X ticks before rallying X ticks, those odds might be more like 60 percent. Again,\nno one can ever know the exact odds, but it is helpful to be aware of the bias because it should influence you when you are thinking about taking a\ntrade. You should be more inclined to buy near the bottom of a trading range in a large bull market than you are to short at the top.\nNeither the bulls nor the bears know the direction of the breakout, but both are comfortable trading within the range; and because of the tendency\nof bulls to buy less and bears to sell more at the top of the range and to do the opposite at the bottom, the market spends most of the time\nsomewhere in the middle. This area of comfort has a magnetic pull, and whenever the market moves from it, the market gets drawn back into it.\nEven if there is a successful breakout that runs several bars, it usually will get pulled back into the range, and that is the basis for final flags, which\nare discussed in book 3. It is also common to see a breakout in one direction that runs for several bars, then a reversal, then a breakout in the\nopposite direction, and then a pullback into the range. The magnetic effect of a trading range can affect the market for several days, and it is\ncommon to see the market trend away from a strong trading range, like a relatively tight range that lasted 10 or more bars, only to come back into\nthe range two or three days later.\nWhat causes either the bulls or the bears in a trading range to change their perspective, eventually allowing a breakout to succeed? Rarely, there\nwill be a news item like a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) report that is expected at a specific time in the middle of the day, but most of\nthe time the breakout is unanticipated. There will always be a news-related reason for the breakout given on TV, but most of the time it probably is\nirrelevant to what is taking place. Once the market breaks out, CNBC will find some pundit who will confidently explain how it was the direct result of\nsome news item. If instead the market broke out in the opposite direction, the pundit would then argue the opposite interpretation of the same news\nitem. For example, if the market broke out to the upside on an FOMC interest rate cut, the pundit would argue that lower rates are good for the\nmarket. If it broke to the downside on the same rate cut, the pundit would argue that the rate cut is proof that the Federal Reserve thinks the\neconomy is weak and therefore the market is overpriced. Both explanations are irrelevant and have nothing to do with what just took place. Nothing\nis ever that simple and, in any case, it is irrelevant to a trader. Most of the volume every day is generated by programs; there are dozens of big\nones running before and during the breakout, and they are designed independently of one another by different firms that are each trying to take\nmoney from the others. The logic behind the programs is unknowable and therefore irrelevant. All that matters to traders is the net result. As a\ntrader, you should follow the institutions, and if they are driving the market up, you should follow them and be a buyer. If they are driving the market\ndown, you should follow them and be a seller.\nAlmost invariably, the breakout will be unfolding over the course of 10 or more bars before it finally succeeds, which might be an hour before the\nnews was released. The market has already made up its mind about the direction of the breakout, no matter what the news will be, and if you can\nread the price action, you can often position yourself before the breakout occurs.\nFor example, if the bulls begin to become impatient because they thought that the market should have broken out of the upside by now, they will\nstart to sell out of their longs. This will add to the selling pressure of the bears. Also, those bulls will likely want significantly lower prices before\nlooking to buy again, and their absence of buying at the bottom of the range will remove buying pressure; the result will be that prices will fall down\nin a bear trend to a lower level where the bulls see value again, and another trading range will form. In an upside breakout, the opposite happens.\nBears are no longer willing to short within the range and they will buy back their shorts, adding to the buying pressure of the bulls. They will look to\nshort again only at a significantly higher price, which creates a thin area where the bulls move the market up quickly in a bull breakout. The market\nwill continue to move up quickly in a bull trend until it reaches a level where the bears once again believe that there is value in shorting and the bulls\nstart to take profits on their longs. Then, two-sided trading will resume and another trading range will form.\nIf the sideways price action has lasted for about 5 to 20 bars and is very tight, then a trader has to be particularly careful because the bulls and\nbears are in very tight balance. Trading breakouts in this situation can be costly since every brief up move is sold aggressively by the bears and the\nnew bulls are quick to exit. This results in tails at the tops of the bars near the top of the range. Likewise, every sharp move down is quickly\nreversed, creating tails at the bottoms of the bars near the bottom of the range. There are, however, ways to profitably trade this type of market.\nSome firms and many traders are scaling into longs and out of shorts every few ticks lower and doing the opposite every few ticks higher. However,\n", "text_clean": "The media makes it sound like traders oscillate between fear and greed. That is probably true for beginners, but not for experienced traders, who rarely feel either. Another pair of emotions is much more common with them, and also much more useful: uncertainty and urgency. A trend is an area of certainty, or at least relative certainty. Your personal radar can tell you if the market is more likely in a trend instead of a strong leg within a trading range. If you have a sense of uncertainty, the market is more likely in a trading range; if instead you have a sense of urgency and you are hoping for a pullback, then the market is more likely in a trend. Every trend is made of a series of spikes and trading ranges, and the spikes are brief. When they exist, there is a directional bias to the probabilities. This means that during a spike in a bull trend, the odds of the market moving X ticks higher before it moves X ticks lower are more than 50 percent, and can be 70 percent or more if the trend is strong. Both the bulls and the bears agree that the market needs to move to a new price level, where uncertainty will return. A trading range is that area of uncertainty, and whenever you are uncertain about the direction of the market, it is likely in a trading range. Within the middle of a trading range, the probability of the market moving up or down X ticks is about 50 percent most of the time. There are brief fluctuations in this probability, but most of them last for too few ticks to be traded profitably. This search for uncertainty is the basis of measured moves. The market will continue its higher-probability directional move until the odds fall below 50–50, meaning that a reversal is likely (the odds are greater that the market will now move in the opposite direction). Most of the time, that will occur at some area of support or resistance, like a prior swing point or trend line or trend channel line, and most of the time it will be in the area of some measured move. The reversal is a move toward what will become the middle of a trading range where there is a 50 percent chance of the market moving up or down X ticks before it goes X ticks in the opposite direction.\nWhen you are completely neutral about a trading range, the directional probability of an equidistant move is 50 percent, and the market is around what will become the middle of the range. As the market works toward the top of the range, the odds favor the market going down, and the directional probability is 60 percent or more that the market will fall X ticks before it goes up X ticks. Near the bottom of the range, that is reversed, and the directional probability favors a rally. If there has been a strong bull trend leading up to the range and there has not been a clear top, then there is a directional bias in favor of the bulls, even when the market is in the middle of the trading range. If the trend was very strong, then the directional probability in the middle of the range might be 53 to 55 percent, although it is impossible to ever be certain. Just be aware that trading ranges are continuation patterns on higher time frame charts, and if there was a strong bull trend leading up to it and no clear top, the odds of an upside breakout are greater. Following a strong bull trend, when the market falls to the bottom of the range, the directional probability of an equidistant move is greater than at the bottom of a trading range that formed after a bear trend, so instead of 60 percent in favor of a rally, maybe it is 70 to 80 percent. In fact, the odds of a rally that is twice or three times X ticks before a sell-off of X ticks might even be 70 percent or higher. For example, if the trading range is 50 ticks tall and you bought above a bull reversal bar on a two-legged pullback to the bottom of the range, and the bar is eight ticks tall, there might be a 70 percent chance of the market rallying 20 or 30 ticks before hitting your stop 10 ticks below your entry.\nLikewise, near the top of the range, the directional probability of an equidistant move is less than in a trading range that followed a bear trend, and instead of a 70 percent to 80 percent chance of the market falling X ticks before rallying X ticks, those odds might be more like 60 percent. Again, no one can ever know the exact odds, but it is helpful to be aware of the bias because it should influence you when you are thinking about taking a trade. You should be more inclined to buy near the bottom of a trading range in a large bull market than you are to short at the top.\nNeither the bulls nor the bears know the direction of the breakout, but both are comfortable trading within the range; and because of the tendency of bulls to buy less and bears to sell more at the top of the range and to do the opposite at the bottom, the market spends most of the time somewhere in the middle. This area of comfort has a magnetic pull, and whenever the market moves from it, the market gets drawn back into it.\nEven if there is a successful breakout that runs several bars, it usually will get pulled back into the range, and that is the basis for final flags, which are discussed in book 3. It is also common to see a breakout in one direction that runs for several bars, then a reversal, then a breakout in the opposite direction, and then a pullback into the range. The magnetic effect of a trading range can affect the market for several days, and it is common to see the market trend away from a strong trading range, like a relatively tight range that lasted 10 or more bars, only to come back into the range two or three days later.\nWhat causes either the bulls or the bears in a trading range to change their perspective, eventually allowing a breakout to succeed? Rarely, there will be a news item like a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) report that is expected at a specific time in the middle of the day, but most of the time the breakout is unanticipated. There will always be a news-related reason for the breakout given on TV, but most of the time it probably is irrelevant to what is taking place. Once the market breaks out, CNBC will find some pundit who will confidently explain how it was the direct result of some news item. If instead the market broke out in the opposite direction, the pundit would then argue the opposite interpretation of the same news item. For example, if the market broke out to the upside on an FOMC interest rate cut, the pundit would argue that lower rates are good for the market. If it broke to the downside on the same rate cut, the pundit would argue that the rate cut is proof that the Federal Reserve thinks the economy is weak and therefore the market is overpriced. Both explanations are irrelevant and have nothing to do with what just took place. Nothing is ever that simple and, in any case, it is irrelevant to a trader. Most of the volume every day is generated by programs; there are dozens of big ones running before and during the breakout, and they are designed independently of one another by different firms that are each trying to take money from the others. The logic behind the programs is unknowable and therefore irrelevant. All that matters to traders is the net result. As a trader, you should follow the institutions, and if they are driving the market up, you should follow them and be a buyer. If they are driving the market down, you should follow them and be a seller.\nAlmost invariably, the breakout will be unfolding over the course of 10 or more bars before it finally succeeds, which might be an hour before the news was released. The market has already made up its mind about the direction of the breakout, no matter what the news will be, and if you can read the price action, you can often position yourself before the breakout occurs.\nFor example, if the bulls begin to become impatient because they thought that the market should have broken out of the upside by now, they will start to sell out of their longs. This will add to the selling pressure of the bears. Also, those bulls will likely want significantly lower prices before looking to buy again, and their absence of buying at the bottom of the range will remove buying pressure; the result will be that prices will fall down in a bear trend to a lower level where the bulls see value again, and another trading range will form. In an upside breakout, the opposite happens.\nBears are no longer willing to short within the range and they will buy back their shorts, adding to the buying pressure of the bulls. They will look to short again only at a significantly higher price, which creates a thin area where the bulls move the market up quickly in a bull breakout. The market will continue to move up quickly in a bull trend until it reaches a level where the bears once again believe that there is value in shorting and the bulls start to take profits on their longs. Then, two-sided trading will resume and another trading range will form.\nIf the sideways price action has lasted for about 5 to 20 bars and is very tight, then a trader has to be particularly careful because the bulls and bears are in very tight balance. Trading breakouts in this situation can be costly since every brief up move is sold aggressively by the bears and the new bulls are quick to exit.

They also tend to break out away from the moving average. If they are below the moving average, they usually break to the downside, and if\nthey are above it, they tend to break out to the upside. This is especially true if the trading range is adjacent to the moving average. If they are far\nfrom the moving average, they may be setting up a test back to the moving average. If a bull swing pauses in a trading range, the odds favor the\nultimate breakout taking place to the upside. However, there may be several failed breakouts of the top and bottom before the final breakout, and\nsometimes the market breaks out countertrend. Also, the longer a trading range continues, the greater are the odds that it will become a reversal\npattern (accumulation in a bear trading range, distribution in a bull trading range). This is because the with-trend traders will become concerned that\nthey are failing to make the trend resume, and they will begin to cover their positions and will stop adding to them. Because of these uncertainties,\ntraders need to be careful and look for low-risk price action setups. Trading ranges on a 5 minute chart that last for hours with many big, hard-to-\nread swings can be small, clean, and easy-to-read trading ranges on a 15 or 60 minute chart, so it sometimes is helpful to look at higher time\nframes. Many traders, in fact, trade higher time frame charts.\nThe chart on your screen is in a trading range most of the time, with the bulls and the bears in general agreement about value. Within the trading\nrange, there are small trends; and within those trends, there are small trading ranges. When the market is trending, the bulls and the bears are also\nin agreement about value, and the agreement is that the value area is somewhere else. The market is moving quickly to a trading range where both\nbulls and bears feel there is value, and they will fight it out until it becomes clear that one side is right and the other is wrong, and then the market will\ntrend again.\nSome trading range days are composed of two or three large trending swings; during the swings, the market behaves like a strong trend.\nHowever, the first reversal usually does not begin until after the first hour or so, and a trend day is usually underway before then. When a trend starts\ntoo late, there is a good chance that the day will be a trading range day and that there will be at least a second reversal and a test of the middle of\nthe range.\nThe middle third of the day, from around 8:30 a.m. until 10:30 a.m. PST, can be difficult for traders on days that are not clearly trending (in other\nwords, most days). If the market is trading in the approximate middle of the day's range (or just the middle of a trading range within the day's range)\nand it is now in the middle of the day's trading hours, the chance of a tight trading range with overlapping bars, big tails, and multiple small reversals\nis significant, and most traders would be wise to trade sparingly. It is usually better to forgo any less than perfect entry under these circumstances\nand instead wait for a test of the high or low of the day. A trader who is not yet successful should not trade when the market is in the middle of the\nday while it is also in the middle of the day's range. This change to one's trading alone can mean the difference between being a loser and a\nwinner.\nSometimes there will be an extremely great-looking pattern setting up midday in the Emini and you will get one tick of slippage on the entry. If the\nmarket does not race to your profit target within seconds, the chances are high that you have been trapped. In this case, it is almost always better to\nplace a limit order to get out at breakeven. Whenever something looks too good to be true, so obvious that everyone will look to enter, the odds are\nhigh that it is exactly as it appears to be—not true.\nWhenever there is a spike up and then a spike down, or vice versa, the market has formed a climax reversal, which is discussed in the third\nbook. A spike is usually followed by a channel; but since there have been spikes in both directions, the bulls and bears will continue trading\naggressively as they try to overpower each other and create a channel in their direction. This two-sided trading that usually takes place after a\nclimax is a trading range, and it can be as brief as a single bar or can last for dozens of bars. The eventual breakout will usually lead to a measured\nmove that approximates the height of the spike.\nA trading range can sometimes appear to be a reversal setup but in fact be just a pause in the trend. For example, if there is a strong bull trend\non the 60 minute chart and the 5 minute chart has a strong spike down that lasts several bars, which is followed by a pullback rally that lasts several\nbars and then a second spike down for several more bars, the pattern might look strongly bearish on the 5 minute chart, but it could be a simple\nhigh 2 or double bottom buy setup on the 60 minute chart. This is especially true if the ABC ends at the 60 minute moving average. You do not have\nto look at the 60 minute chart, but you should always be aware of the direction of the trend that preceded the trading range. This will give you more\nconfidence to place the trade, which here is a large high 2 buy pattern and not the start of a new bear trend.\nSometimes the low of a bear trend day, especially a climactic one, can come from a small trading range that has large bars, often with large tails\nor large reversal bodies. These reversals are less common at tops, which tend to be less climactic than bottoms. These trading ranges are often\nother signals as well, such as double bottom pullbacks or double top bear flags.\nEven though trading ranges are flags on higher time frame charts and usually break out in the direction of the trend, some break out in the\nopposite direction. In fact, most reversal patterns are some type of trading range. A head and shoulders pattern is an obvious one. A double top\nand a double bottom are also trading ranges. This is discussed further in the chapter on trend reversals in book 3, but it is important to realize that\nmost trading ranges within trends break out in the direction of the trend and do not lead to reversals. Therefore, all reversal patterns are actually\ncontinuation patterns that occasionally fail to continue and instead reverse. Because of this, it is far better to look for with-trend entries when you\nsee a reversal pattern than to look for reversal entries. This means that if there is a bull trend and it is forming a head and shoulders top, it is far\nbetter to look for a buy signal as the market tries to break out to the downside than it is to short on the breakout.\nAll trends contain trading ranges of different sizes and some trends are predominantly trading ranges, like trending trading range days, which\nwere discussed earlier in book 1, Chapter 22. You should be aware that the market often tries to reverse the final trading range in the last hour or\nso, so if the day is a bear trending trading range day, look for a buy setup at the low of the day going into the final hour or two of the day.\nSome experienced traders are good at knowing when a trend is evolving into a trading range, and they will scale into countertrend trades once\nthey believe it is happening. For example, if the day is a bull trending trading range day and the breakout has reached the area of the measured\nmove based on the height of the lower trading range, and if the rally has been in a relatively weak bull channel, bears will begin to short above prior\nswing highs. They will also watch for a relatively large bull trend bar and short its close or above its high, since it could be a buy climax and be the\nend or near the end of the bull channel and, therefore, near the top of a trading range. Only very experienced traders should attempt this, and most\nof those traders will trade small enough so that they can scale into their short positions if the market continues higher. If it does go higher and they\nscale in, some would take profits on their entire position once the market pulls back to their first entry. Others will exit the first entry at breakeven\nand hold the remainder for a test of the bottom of the channel. As the bull channel is progressing, beginners will see only a bull trend, but\nexperienced traders will see the first leg of a developing trading range. Once the day is over and beginners look back, they will see the trading\nrange and agree that it began at the bottom of the bull channel.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 137, "text_raw": "range only if there is a strong signal, preferably a second signal. The experienced traders who shorted were scalping because they saw the market\nas entering a trading range and not reversing into a bear trend. When the market is in a trading range, traders should generally only be scalping\nuntil the next trend begins, at which point they can once again swing part or all of their trades.\nThe single most difficult aspect of trading in a trading range is the trading range dilemma. Since most breakouts fail, your profit goals are limited,\nwhich means that you are scalping. However, when you reduce your reward yet keep your risk the same, you need a much higher probability of\nsuccess to satisfy the trader's equation. Otherwise, you are trading a strategy that is guaranteed to eventually blow your account (i.e., drop it to\nbelow the minimum margin requirements for your broker to allow you to place trades). The dilemma is that you have to scalp, but scalping requires\na very high probability of success, and that high degree of certainty cannot exist for long in a trading range, where by definition uncertainty prevails.\nIf the range is particularly tight, the chance of success is even smaller. One way to improve your chance of success is to enter with limit orders as\nthe market is going against you. For example, some traders will short above a weak-looking high 1 or high 2, or above a swing high or bull trend\nbar at the top of the range. They might also buy below a weak low 1 or low 2, or a swing low or bear trend bar at the bottom of the range. Another\napproach is to take a smaller initial position and scale in if the market goes against you.\nIf the range is large enough, most traders try to short small bear reversal bars at the top of the range and buy small bull reversal bars at the\nbottom of the range, especially when there are second entries, like shorting a low 2 at the top of the range or buying a high 2 at the bottom of the\nrange. Remember, although both high 2 and low 2 setups are valid in trading ranges, traders trade them differently from when they form in trends.\nWhen there is a bull trend, traders will buy a high 2 near the top of a leg, but when there is a trading range, they will buy a high 2 only if it is at the\nbottom of the range. Similarly, bears will short a low 2 at the bottom of a bear trend but they will short a low 2 in a trading range only when it is at the\ntop of the range.\nSince a trading range is simply a horizontal channel, you trade it like any other channel. If the swings are small, you scalp; if they are large, you\ncan scalp or swing some of your position to the opposite end. If the trading range is very large and has lasted several days, entire days can be\nstrong trends and still be within the trading range. When that happens, trade the day like any other trend day. If the swings are very small, the trading\nrange is a tight trading range, which is discussed Chapter 22. The tighter the range, the fewer trades you should take. When the range is a tight\ntrading range, you should rarely take any trades.\nWhen the market is in a trading range, look to buy near the bottom of the range and short near the top. In general, if the market has been going\ndown for about 5 to 10 bars, only look to buy, especially if the market is near the bottom of the range. If the market has been going up for five to 10\nbars, only look to short, especially if it is near the top of the range. Trade in the middle of the range only if the swings are large enough to make a\nprofit. For example, if the trading range is 10 ticks tall, you do not want to buy six ticks above the low of the range, since the odds of the market\ngoing six ticks further up are not great and that is what you would need to make a four-tick profit. If the trading range is six points tall, you can buy a\nhigher low and enter in the middle of the range since there is room above to make a scalper's profit before the market encounters the resistance of\nthe top of the range. The chapter on channels in book 1 discusses how to trade them, and since a trading range is simply a horizontal channel, the\ntechniques are the same.\nMost of the bars will be in the middle of the range, and the market spends very little time at the extremes. When it is at the extremes, it usually got\nthere with a strong trend bar, making many traders believe that the breakout will be successful and strong. There will often be three or more large,\noverlapping bars with a signal bar forcing bulls to buy near the high tick, and this usually is a trap. For example, suppose the market just raced to\nthe bottom of the range with a couple of strong bear trend bars but has been sideways for a couple of bars, sitting just below the moving average;\nnow there is a strong bear reversal bar, but it mostly overlaps the prior bars, and the entry price would be within a tick or so of the bottom of the\nbear flag. In this situation, don't take the trade. This is usually a bear trap, and it is much better to place a limit order to buy at the low of that bear\nreversal bar than to place a stop order to go short at one tick below its low. Take this fade only if you are experienced with your read.\nThe best entries are second entries at the top or bottom of the range where the signal bar is a reversal bar in your direction that is not too large\nand does not overlap the prior bar too much. However, the appearance of the signal bar is less important for trading range reversals than for trend\nreversals. Short setups at the top of the range often have signal bars with bull bodies, and buy setups near the bottom of the range often have bear\nbodies. A strong reversal bar is not usually mandatory unless a trader is looking to take a reversal trade in a strong trend.\nMost traders will lose money if they scalp, even if they win on 60 percent of their trades. This is especially true if their risk is about twice as large\nas their potential reward. This means that traders have to be very careful with trading range trades. Given that 80 percent of breakout attempts fail,\na trading range trader has to have limited goals, and many of the best trades will be big scalps or small swings. For example, if the average daily\nrange in the Emini has recently been approximately 10 to 15 points, the average protective stop will be about two points. If traders are shorting\nbelow a strong bear signal at the top of a trading range that is at least six points tall, especially if they are taking a second signal, they have at least\na 60 percent chance of making two points while risking two points. This results in a minimally profitable trader's equation and is therefore a\nsuccessful strategy. If it appears that the move could fall four points, traders might take a quarter to half off at two points and try to swing the\nremainder for about four points. They might move the stop to breakeven after taking two-point partial profits, or they could tighten it from two points\nto maybe one point (four ticks) or five ticks. At that point, they are risking five ticks to make four points, and even if the chance of success is only\n40 percent, they have a winning trader's equation. Some traders who took partial or full profits at two points will place limit orders to short again at\ntheir original entry price, but risk only about five ticks this time. They might try for two to four points on their trade, depending on the overall market. If\nthe entry bar or the following bar becomes a strong bear bar, they will be inclined to hold for a larger move.\nIf the trading range is only three or sometimes even four points tall, entering on stops is usually a losing strategy. The trading range is then a\nrelatively tight trading range, which is discussed later, and only very experienced traders should trade it. Most of the trades require limit order\nentries, and beginners should never buy when the market is falling or sell when it is rallying, because they invariably will choose situations in which\nthe move will go so far that they will become frightened and exit with a loss.\nRegardless of how tall the range is, if you are looking to trade and the leg that is testing the top or bottom of the range is a tight channel, it is\nbetter to wait for a breakout pullback, which is a second entry. So if the market has been going up for 10 bars and is near the top of the trading\nrange, but these 10 bars are in a micro channel, do not short below the low of the prior bar—the upward momentum is too strong. Instead, wait to\nsee if there is a pullback from this micro channel breakout. The pullback can be any test of the top of the channel, including a lower high, double top,\nor a higher high. Then look to short below the low of the prior bar and place a protective stop above the high of the signal bar. The setup is more\nreliable if that signal bar is a good bear reversal bar, especially if it is not too large. If it is too large, it will likely overlap one or more bars too much\nand will have you shorting too far below the high of the range. When this happens, it is usually better to wait for a pullback before shorting.\nAny short setup is also more reliable if there is other evidence of strong bears entering the market within the prior 10 bars, like two or three bars\naround this level with large tails on top, or several recent bars with strong bear bodies. This represents building selling pressure and increases the\nchances that the trade will be successful. Similarly, if you are looking to buy at the bottom of the range and there are a few bars at this level with\n", "text_clean": "range only if there is a strong signal, preferably a second signal.

If there is support or resistance like a dueling lines pattern near your entry, the odds of a successful trade increase.\nTrading ranges always look like they are breaking out, but the majority of breakout attempts fail. The extremes are often tested by large trend\nbars, and, if you are an experienced trader, you can fade the close of one of these bars. Although it is safer to wait for the breakout to fail before\nentering (breakouts and failures were discussed in Part I), if you are confident that the trend bar is just running stops beyond a swing high or low,\nyou can enter of the close on the bar, especially if you can scale in if the market goes against you. For example, if the market has been in a quiet\ntrading range for the past three hours and just formed a two-legged move down below a prior swing low, and the close was on the low of the bar,\nyou can consider buying at the market on the close of the bar. If most of the up legs have had more momentum than the down legs, the odds are\nbetter, and they are better still if the trend bar is testing a trend line, a trend channel line, a measured move target, or other support level.\nSince not all of the swings reach the extreme of the range, you can consider scaling into a trade. For example, if the market has been going up\nfor eight bars and is forming a low 3 below the top of the trading range, you can consider shorting the low 3 setup and using a wide stop of maybe\nfour points in the Emini on a day when the average range has been about 10 points. If the low 3 succeeds and you have a profitable trade, you exit.\nIf the low 3 fails, it is likely that there will soon be a low 4 and that it will be successful. If so, you can scale into the trade by shorting a fixed number of\nticks above your entry, or above the high of a prior bar or swing high, or on a stop on the low 4 signal. You can then exit both short positions near the\nbottom of the range or maybe at the entry price of the first short. This entry would then be a breakeven trade and the second, higher entry would be\nprofitable. Scaling in and out of trades is discussed in Chapter 31.\nBecause trading ranges are two-sided, pullbacks are common. If you take a trade in a trading range, you have to be willing to sit through a\npullback. However, if the trading range might be turning into a trend, you should exit if the market goes against you and wait for a second signal.\nYour odds of success are greater if you have the ability to scale in as the market goes against you.\nIf the market is at the bottom of the range and the downward momentum is weak and the market reverses up for a bar or two, it might be setting\nup a low 1 short. Since you should short a low 1 setup only in the spike phase of a bear trend and not in a trading range, it is unlikely that this low 1\nwould be profitable. You then believe that the odds are that a short below the low of the prior bar would go up eight ticks before it falls six ticks. That\nmeans that it makes sense to place a limit order to buy at or a couple of ticks below the low of the prior bar, expecting a failed low 1 short and a\nhigher low. Also, if you believe that the market is forming a bull channel, you expect the low 2 to fail as well, and you therefore can place a limit order\nto buy at or below the low of the low 2 signal bar. You can do the opposite near the top of the range as the market is turning down and forming low-\nprobability high 1 and high 2 buy setups. Place a limit order to short at or just above the high of the high 1 or high 2 signal bar.\nSince the legs in a trading range often subdivide into two smaller legs, you can fade the breakout of the prior leg. Buying a breakout above a\nswing high usually yields a profitable trade only in a strong bull trend, and shorting below a swing low is usually profitable only in a strong bear trend.\nIf the market just pulled back from the first leg down in a trading range, the odds of a successful short trade where you enter on the breakout of the\nbottom of that first leg are small. Instead, you can consider placing a limit order to buy a few ticks below that low for a scalp up.\nBecause most breakout attempts fail, never overstay any trade hoping for a successful breakout. Look to exit longs on scalp profit targets or on\ntests of the top of the range, and take profits on shorts on limit orders that give a scalper's profit or exit on a test of the bottom of the range. Never\nrely on martingale trading. This is discussed in Chapter 25, but it is a gambling technique where you double or triple the size of your next trade if\nyou just lost on your prior trade. If you keep losing, you keep doubling or tripling the size of your prior trade until you win. Almost invariably when you\nare thinking about this, the market is in a tight trading range and will likely have four or more consecutive losers; you would therefore abandon the\napproach because it would require you to trade far more contracts than you can handle emotionally, and this will leave you with a huge loss. A\nbreakout or a winning trade is never overdue, and the market can sustain unsustainable behavior much longer than you can sustain your account.\nBe fussy and take only reasonable entries, and never base any entry on the idea that the market is overdue for a good trade.\nFigure PIV.1 Most of the Bars on Any Chart Are within Trading Ranges\nThe market is composed of trading ranges separated by brief trends, and each trading range is made up of smaller trends and trading ranges.\nFigure PIV.1 is a 10 minute chart of the Emini that shows about six weeks of price action. If a trader were watching only a 5 minute chart with about\na day and a half of data, it would be easy to overlook the big picture. Some of the days were small trading range days, but those days were in the\ncontext of a large bull market. The large trading ranges are labeled with letters and the small trading ranges with numbers (the numbers refer to the\ntrading ranges and not the bars). Although trading ranges repeatedly try to break out of the top and bottom and 80 percent of those attempts fail,\nwhen the breakout does come, it is usually in the same direction as the trend that preceded it. Most reversal patterns are trading ranges, like the\nrightmost trading range (13), but most reversal attempts turn into flags and break out in the direction of the trend.\nWhile the market is in a trading range, traders can take trades in both directions, looking for small profits on each trade, but when there is a\nstrong buy setup at the bottom of a trading range in a bull trend, a trader can swing part or all of the trade. For example, within the large B trading\nrange, there were three pushes down, creating a triangle, and each push down tested the top of the large A trading range. The small 8 trading\nrange also had a double bottom, and it was a bull flag down from the 6 trading range. A day trader might have swung a long into the close of the\nday, but traders willing to hold a position overnight saw that this was a good buy setup for a trade that could last several days.\n", "text_clean": "large tails on the bottom or several bars with bull bodies, then the bulls are becoming aggressive, and this buying pressure increases the chances of a profitable long trade. If there is support or resistance like a dueling lines pattern near your entry, the odds of a successful trade increase.\nTrading ranges always look like they are breaking out, but the majority of breakout attempts fail. The extremes are often tested by large trend bars, and, if you are an experienced trader, you can fade the close of one of these bars. Although it is safer to wait for the breakout to fail before entering (breakouts and failures were discussed in Part I), if you are confident that the trend bar is just running stops beyond a swing high or low, you can enter of the close on the bar, especially if you can scale in if the market goes against you. For example, if the market has been in a quiet trading range for the past three hours and just formed a two-legged move down below a prior swing low, and the close was on the low of the bar, you can consider buying at the market on the close of the bar. If most of the up legs have had more momentum than the down legs, the odds are better, and they are better still if the trend bar is testing a trend line, a trend channel line, a measured move target, or other support level.\nSince not all of the swings reach the extreme of the range, you can consider scaling into a trade. For example, if the market has been going up for eight bars and is forming a low 3 below the top of the trading range, you can consider shorting the low 3 setup and using a wide stop of maybe four points in the Emini on a day when the average range has been about 10 points. If the low 3 succeeds and you have a profitable trade, you exit.\nIf the low 3 fails, it is likely that there will soon be a low 4 and that it will be successful. If so, you can scale into the trade by shorting a fixed number of ticks above your entry, or above the high of a prior bar or swing high, or on a stop on the low 4 signal. You can then exit both short positions near the bottom of the range or maybe at the entry price of the first short. This entry would then be a breakeven trade and the second, higher entry would be profitable. Scaling in and out of trades is discussed in Chapter 31.\nBecause trading ranges are two-sided, pullbacks are common. If you take a trade in a trading range, you have to be willing to sit through a pullback. However, if the trading range might be turning into a trend, you should exit if the market goes against you and wait for a second signal.\nYour odds of success are greater if you have the ability to scale in as the market goes against you.\nIf the market is at the bottom of the range and the downward momentum is weak and the market reverses up for a bar or two, it might be setting up a low 1 short. Since you should short a low 1 setup only in the spike phase of a bear trend and not in a trading range, it is unlikely that this low 1 would be profitable. You then believe that the odds are that a short below the low of the prior bar would go up eight ticks before it falls six ticks. That means that it makes sense to place a limit order to buy at or a couple of ticks below the low of the prior bar, expecting a failed low 1 short and a higher low. Also, if you believe that the market is forming a bull channel, you expect the low 2 to fail as well, and you therefore can place a limit order to buy at or below the low of the low 2 signal bar. You can do the opposite near the top of the range as the market is turning down and forming lowprobability high 1 and high 2 buy setups. Place a limit order to short at or just above the high of the high 1 or high 2 signal bar.\nSince the legs in a trading range often subdivide into two smaller legs, you can fade the breakout of the prior leg. Buying a breakout above a swing high usually yields a profitable trade only in a strong bull trend, and shorting below a swing low is usually profitable only in a strong bear trend.\nIf the market just pulled back from the first leg down in a trading range, the odds of a successful short trade where you enter on the breakout of the bottom of that first leg are small. Instead, you can consider placing a limit order to buy a few ticks below that low for a scalp up.\nBecause most breakout attempts fail, never overstay any trade hoping for a successful breakout. Look to exit longs on scalp profit targets or on tests of the top of the range, and take profits on shorts on limit orders that give a scalper's profit or exit on a test of the bottom of the range. Never rely on martingale trading. This is discussed in Chapter 25, but it is a gambling technique where you double or triple the size of your next trade if you just lost on your prior trade. If you keep losing, you keep doubling or tripling the size of your prior trade until you win. Almost invariably when you are thinking about this, the market is in a tight trading range and will likely have four or more consecutive losers; you would therefore abandon the approach because it would require you to trade far more contracts than you can handle emotionally, and this will leave you with a huge loss. A breakout or a winning trade is never overdue, and the market can sustain unsustainable behavior much longer than you can sustain your account.\nBe fussy and take only reasonable entries, and never base any entry on the idea that the market is overdue for a good trade.\nFigure PIV.1 Most of the Bars on Any Chart Are within Trading Ranges The market is composed of trading ranges separated by brief trends, and each trading range is made up of smaller trends and trading ranges.\nFigure PIV.1 is a 10 minute chart of the Emini that shows about six weeks of price action. If a trader were watching only a 5 minute chart with about a day and a half of data, it would be easy to overlook the big picture. Some of the days were small trading range days, but those days were in the context of a large bull market.

A bear channel is a bull flag. Bulls can buy the reversal up from the bottom of the trading range or on the breakout pullback that usually follows\nsoon afterward. The opposite is true of trading ranges in bear trends, where the final leg is usually a bull channel, which is a bear flag.\nFigure PIV.2 Multiple Early Reversals Often Lead to a Trading Range Day\nMultiple reversals in the first couple of hours usually result in a trading range day. Big traders often come into the day expecting a trading range day,\nand when enough do, their scalping and reversing often result in one forming. As shown in Figure PIV.2, today broke out but then reversed down at\nbar 1 and reversed up at bar 2. The reversal failed at bar 3, but the attempt at a bear channel failed at bar 4, and the market reversed up again. The\nbull spike up to bar 5 had two pauses along the way, indicating hesitancy. After the spike up, the market went sideways for about 10 bars and had\nmany small reversals within the bull flag, as well as five bear bodies, again showing that the market was very two-sided, which is the hallmark of a\ntrading range. Bar 7 was a bull trend bar to a new high of the day, but was immediately followed by a bear inside bar instead of two or three more\nbull trend bars. The market then had several large dojis; two of them had big tails on the top, showing that traders aggressively sold into the close of\nthe bars (selling pressure). This shows that the bears were very strong at the high of the day, which is what commonly happens in a trading range.\nThe directional probability of an equidistant move rose in favor of the bears. In this case, the odds of a two-point move down before a two-point\nmove up might have been 60 percent. Although it is impossible to know exactly, traders believed that the shorts had the edge. Most traders\nsuspected at this point that the day was a trading range day and the odds of a move down below the middle of the range were good. If traders\nshorted at any point after bar 7 and risked about two to three points, they probably had about a 60 percent chance of the market testing below the\nmidpoint of the day, which was five to eight points lower, depending on where they shorted. Risking two points to make five points with 60 percent\ncertainty is a great trade.\nThe middle of the day on a trading range day is a magnet and usually gets tested repeatedly during the day, including after the breakout to a new\nhigh. Also, since trading range days usually close in the middle of the day's range, look to fade tests of the extremes, like at bars 7, 9, 10, and 12.\nTraders were shorting above swing highs, like above bars 1, 3, and 5, and they were adding on, maybe at one or two points higher. If they added\non, many traders would have exited some or all of their positions when the market returned to the original entry price. This would be a breakeven\ntrade, but they would have a profit on their higher entries. If the market immediately went their way, they would scalp out of most or all of their\npositions because on trading range days it is better to scalp unless you are shorting at the very top or bottom of the day, where you can swing part\nof your position for a test of the middle of the day or even a test of the opposite extreme. Bulls bought below bars 6 and 8, and many were willing to\nscale in lower.\nIn general, doing the opposite of what you would do on a trend day is effective, especially if you can scale in. Once traders believe that the day is\na trading range day, they will place trades based on that belief. Instead of looking to buy a high 1 or high 2 near the high, it is better to short above\nthose signal bars. Instead of looking to short a low 1 or low 2 near the bottom of the range, it is better to buy below those bars. Traders enter on limit\nand market orders. Some look at a smaller time frame chart, wait for a reversal bar, and then enter on stops on the reversal. Traders will be\nscalping all day, expecting just about every move to not go far before reversing again. They will short above the high of prior bars and add on\nhigher, and they will buy below the low of prior bars and add on lower. They will also fade large trend bars near the top and bottom of the developing\nrange. The bulls saw the large bull trend bar that formed two bars before bar 1 as a brief opportunity to take profits at a high price. The bears also\ndoubted there would be follow-through buying and shorted. Both the bulls and the bears sold at the close of the big bull trend bar, above its high, on\nthe close of the two bear bars that followed, and below the low of the bear bars.\nOnce the market formed a large bear trend bar before bar 2 that tested below the day's low and near the low of yesterday, both the bulls and the\nbears started buying. The bears were buying back their shorts, and the bulls were initiating new longs. Both bought on the close of the bar and\nbelow its low. Bar 2 had a large tail on the bottom, showing that traders were eager to buy. The next bar had a bull close, and they bought that close\nand above its high. Traders sold on the close of the bar 7 breakout to a new high, even though it was a bull trend bar. They were confident that the\nday was a trading range day, so they waited to short until the market went above the opening high. As the market was going up, they believed that a\nnew high of the day was likely, and since they thought the market would go a little higher, it did not make sense for them to short when they could do\nso at an even better price a few minutes later. This absence of the strongest sellers created a vacuum that sucked the market up quickly. Since they\nwere confident that the new high would fail, they were very happy to sell on the close of a strong bull trend bar. The bulls were selling out of their\nlongs to take profits, and the bears were selling to initiate new shorts. Both wanted to sell when the market was at maximum strength, since they\nbelieved that it should head down. Traders sold on the close of the bear inside bar that followed bar 7 and below its low. The next bar was a small\ndoji bar, which was a weak high 1 buy setup, and many traders sold above its high, expecting it to fail. They also sold below the low of the high 1\nentry bar, since it was then a one-bar lower high. Two bars later, they saw the doji signal bar for the high 2 buy setup as a weak signal, and sold\nabove its high. Once the high 2 entry bar closed near its low, they sold below its low, since this was a failed high 2 sell signal.\nThe strong bull trend bar was a high 4 entry bar, but it was also a big bull trend bar near the high of a trading range day. The bull scalpers sold out\nof their longs, and the bears shorted on the close of the bar and below the bar 9 lower high two-bar reversal (this made the move down to bar 8 a\nfinal flag).\nOnce the market fell to the middle of the range, and especially after it broke below the bar 6 swing low, the bulls thought the breakout would fail.\n", "text_clean": "Notice how the final leg down of most trading ranges is a bear channel, which is a last-ditch attempt by the bears to create a top and a new bear trend.

Traders\nstarted buying the bear closes and the pushes below the lows of the prior bars. By bar 11, the consensus was clear and the market created a bull\nreversal bar, signifying urgency to the upside. There was no one left who was willing to short down there, so the market had to go up to find a price\nthat the bears once again believed offered value for shorting. This price is where they aggressively shorted earlier in the day, and their renewed\nselling created the double top at bar 12.\nBar 12 had a bull body, which is a bad signal bar for a reversal trade, but in a trading range (or at the end of a bear rally in a bear trend), signal\nbars are often not strong, but are still acceptable. At least it had a tail at the top, a small bull body, and a close in the middle.\nFigure PIV.3 Swing Trades in Trading Ranges\nIn Figure PIV.3, there are two trading ranges where traders could have swung part of their position for a possible breakout into a trend. In the upper\nrange, traders could have shorted below the low of bar 3, which was the signal bar for the wedge reversal of the high of yesterday. Since the move\ndown to bar 4 broke below the bull trend line, the market might then form a lower high and then a reversal into a bear trend. This allowed traders to\nshort again below the low of bar 5, well before the breakout below the bottom of the trading range.\nThe market then formed a lower trading range. The bar 11 rally to the top of the range broke the bear trend line, so traders should be looking for a\nlower low or higher low and then a possible trend reversal up. The market formed a wedge bull flag at the bar 14 higher low, and bar 14 was a\nstrong bull reversal bar. This allowed bulls to buy several bars before the breakout actually took place. There were high 1 breakout pullback long\nsetups at bars 16 and 17.\nIn general, the stronger the trend, the more important the signal bar is for a reversal trade. Trading range signal bars are often less than perfect.\nAcceptable short setups can have signal bars with bull bodies. Likewise, acceptable long setups can have signal bars with bear bodies. Examples\ninclude bars 3, 5, and 7, the bar after bar 11, and bar 18.\nExperienced traders saw the breakout down to bar 6 as a likely evolution of a trading range day into a trending trading range day. Aggressive\nbulls bought the close of bar 8, since it was a large bear trend bar in the area of a measured move down in what they thought was likely a\ndeveloping lower trading range. Other bulls bought as bar 8 fell below the low of bar 6, and others bought at a fixed number of ticks below bar 6.\nSome bought at one point below and tried to buy more at two, three, or even four points below. Some thought that the breakout might be a five-tick\nfailed breakout and used that as their reason to buy four ticks below. A few traders sold the breakout below bar 6 and reversed to long at their\nscalper's profit target, one point below their entry price. Others bought on bar 8 as it fell through the trend channel line (not shown) created by\nyesterday's low and bar 6, or after the market bounced a few ticks up from the bar 8 low after falling below the trend channel line. Since these bulls\nbelieved that the market was evolving into a trending trading range day and was forming the lower trading range, they were in scalping mode, as\nmost traders are when the market is in a trading range. The swings today were relatively large, so many bulls were scalping for three or four points\ninstead of just one or two. They needed to be adequately rewarded for taking relatively risky (lower-probability) trades, where the risk was large (the\nbulls who were scaling in were probably risking four to six points). Since experienced traders believed that the market was in a trading range, bear\nscalpers were shorting rallies near the top of the developing trading range, like around bar 7 or bar 11. Since bar 14 was a possible start of a test\nback into the upper range and was followed by several bull trend bars, most bears would have stopped looking to short at that point.\nFigure PIV.4 Middle Third of the Range and of the Day\nWhen the day is not a clear trend day, traders should be very careful during the middle third of the day when the market is around the middle third of\n", "text_clean": "Most breakouts fail in general, and this is especially true on trading range days, and in the middle of the day and in the middle of the range.

In the upper range, traders could have shorted below the low of bar 3, which was the signal bar for the wedge reversal of the high of yesterday.

The bar 11 rally to the top of the range broke the bear trend line, so traders should be looking for a lower low or higher low and then a possible trend reversal up. The market formed a wedge bull flag at the bar 14 higher low, and bar 14 was a strong bull reversal bar. This allowed bulls to buy several bars before the breakout actually took place.

Whenever there are three or more bars that almost completely overlap and they are\njust above the moving average and there is a buy signal where the entry would be close to the top of this trading range, the odds favor it being a bear trap. If you took any trade, it\nmade more sense to short above the high of the prior bar because this was a small, tight trading range, and most trading range breakouts fail. Yes, it was a high 2, but one that\nshould never be bought.\nBar 3 was a failed high 2, so there were trapped bulls at the high of the day. It was also a strong bear trend bar, setting up a good short entry. Since the market was in a trading\nrange at this point, those two small pushes up made bar 3 a low 2 short setup. Since it was near the high of the day, it was a good place to be looking for shorts. Finally, it was\na double top bear flag after a large bear trend bar, and a climactic reversal.\nBar 6 was a low 1 short setup, but it followed consecutive sell climaxes, and the risk that the market would form a two-legged sideways to up correction was significant. The\nodds favored a higher low and a second corrective leg, but the bars were large enough to provide room for a short scalp, despite the likely higher low.\nBar 7 was the first bar of a two-bar reversal, and it was better to buy above the higher of the two bars and not simply above the bull bar. This was an example of how overly eager\nbulls get trapped. Since the market at this point had several big sideways bars, it was in a trading range and it was better to look for shorts near the top of the range and not to\nbuy. Buy low, sell high is the best way to trade trading ranges.\nBar 8 trapped bulls into a bad high 2 long, and they would exit on the low 2 short below bar 8. The signal bar was small enough so that there was room for a short scalp, but\nafter a pair of two-bar reversals and with a doji signal bar, this was a risky short.\nBar 10 was another bull trap that was bought by weak bulls at the top of a big, tempting doji. Again, smart bears would have looked for a small setup bar for a short entry\nbecause the bulls would have been forced to sell and there would have been no buyers left, making the market quickly reach the short scalp profit target. Since this was the\nthird push up, it should have been expected to function like a wedge top, and it was followed by a bear leg into the close. Since this was a trading range, there was nothing for\nreversal patterns to reverse, and buying above tall bars near the top of the range was likely to result in trapped bulls. Smart bears were still shorting above the high of the prior\nbar and below the lows of small bars near the top of the range.\nThis trading range became a final flag that reversed up on the open of the next day with a high 2 entry on the third bar of the day.

The market broke to the upside just before the report and then sold off on bar 1 on the report, and once again tried to break to the upside from the trading\nrange. When the market tries something twice and fails both times, it usually then tries the opposite. This made a downside breakout likely after the bar 1 buy climax.\nThe large bear trend bars that followed bar 10 created the third consecutive sell climax, which had a high probability of being followed by at least a two-legged rally, but\nsometimes instead there is just a two-legged sideways correction.\nFigure PIV.9 Trading Ranges Leading to Reversals\n", "text_clean": "The FOMC report was released at 11:15 a.m. PST, and the 5 minute Emini formed a large bull outside bar at bar 1 in Figure PIV.8, but its high was never exceeded.

Reversal patterns are discussed more fully in book 3. The purpose of this chart is to demonstrate that trading ranges can be reversal\npatterns.\nBars 4, 6, and 8 or 9 were three pushes down, and the low 2 short setup that formed two bars after bar 9 led to a higher low instead of a new low.\nBars 4, 6, and 8 were all large bear trend bars, and they therefore formed three consecutive sell climaxes. That means that on all three bars, traders\nwere aggressively selling at any price instead of on pullbacks. These were traders who were desperate to sell. Although they were mostly longs\nwho were finally giving up, some of them were late, weak bears who had decided that there were not going to be any significant pullbacks. They\nwere upset that they had missed so much of the bear trend, and they were determined not to miss any more, so they shorted at the market and on\nsmall pullbacks. Once these emotional bears shorted and the emotional bulls gave up and sold, there were very few traders left who were willing to\nsell at the bottom of the bear trend. After three sell climaxes, traders would have shorted only if there was a significant rally that had a good short\nsetup. They got the rally, but they did not get a short setup until the move up went on for so long that it became a new bull trend that lasted five years.\nBar 8 and the bar after it both had large tails on their lows. Bar 9 was a bull reversal bar that was the second bar of a two-bar reversal, which was\na reversal bar with a tail on the bottom on a higher time frame chart. Bar 10 and the bar before it also had prominent tails at their lows. This meant\nthat bulls were buying going into the close of all of these bars and they were overwhelming the bears at this price level. The bulls thought this area\nwas a great value for longs, and the bears thought it was too low to short aggressively. Some traders saw bars 8, 9, and 10 as a triple bottom, and\nothers saw it as a head and shoulders bottom. Others thought that bars 8 and 9 formed a double bottom and bar 10 was a successful test of the\nlow, and some saw the move above bar 9 as a breakout and then the move down to bar 10 as a higher low breakout pullback. It never matters what\nwords you use to describe what is going on as long as you see that the market is telling you that the bulls are taking control. After three sell climaxes\nand such a long bear trend, the odds favored at least a two-legged pullback to the moving average and possibly to the beginning of the channels at\nbars 5 and 7. The entire move down from bar 2 was in a channel, and a bear channel is a bull flag. Channels often reverse after the third push down,\nso smart traders knew that this trading range from bar 8 to bar 10 might have been a reversal instead of a bear flag.\nThe push up from bar 20 and the move down to bar 22 comprised a buy climax, despite the bull close of bar 22. Once the market reversed down\nfrom the double top at bar 23, the bears were hoping that bar 23 was a higher high pullback after the bear spike down to bar 22, and they kept\nshorting as they tried to create a channel or spike down. The bulls kept buying and were hoping for a trading range and then another leg up. The bar\n24 bear spike was convincing enough so that most traders thought that lower prices were more likely than higher prices over the next several bars.\nThe bulls tried again to create a bottom at bars 24, 25, and 27, but this was right after a reversal down from a spike and channel top, which was\nlikely to have two legs down and test the bar 12 bottom of the channel. Also, bar 24 was the spike down that turned the market into a probable bear\nswing. There was likely to be follow-through in the form of some type of bear channel because the bar 24 breakout below the bar 22 neckline of the\ndouble top was so strong. Bar 25 was relatively small compared to the down bars and had a bear body. There was another spike down to bar 27,\nwhich made the downward momentum too strong to be buying above bar 27, especially since bar 27 was only a small doji bar and not a strong bull\nreversal bar. With the momentum down being so strong, buyers would not have been willing to buy above a lower low, but they might have been\nwilling to buy above a strong higher low had one formed. The buyers gave up two bars later, and the market collapsed in sell climaxes down to bar\n29 and bar 31.\nThe bar before bar 29, and bars 29 and 31, had large tails at the bottoms, again showing that the buyers were aggressively buying into the close\nof each bar. This was a small three-push-down pattern (this was clear on the daily chart), and the spike down from bar 30 was a sell climax after a\nhuge sell climax down to bar 29. Consecutive sell climaxes usually lead to a pullback, at least to the moving average, lasting at least 10 bars and\nhaving at least two legs, and sometimes they can lead to a trend reversal. This buying was coming in just below the price level where the bulls\nbought aggressively at the bottom of bars 8, 9, and 10. The market was trying to reverse up from the breakout below that swing low, which is\nsomething that is common in trading ranges. In fact, the entire chart was a large trading range, despite the several strong trends that lasted as long\nas five years. Since most breakout attempts fail, buying should have been expected when the market fell below the bar 9 low.\nDeeper Discussion of This Chart\nAs shown in Figure PIV.9, traders began to flip to always-in short as the market fell below the bars 1, 2, 3 head and shoulders top. Some started shorting below the bar 3 bear\ntrend bar and two-bar reversal that formed the lower high. Others shorted for a variety of reasons as the spike grew down to bar 4. Even though bar 5 was a bull reversal bar\nand a breakout above a two-bar reversal, it was the first attempt to break out above the tight bear channel down from bar 3 and therefore was likely to fail. The bulls needed\nmore strength in the form of several bull trend bars before they would become aggressive. The bears saw bar 5 as a micro channel low 1 short and were hoping for a\nmeasured move down. The bottom at bars 8, 9, and 10 was just below a measured move down from the open of the bar 3 start of the spike to the close of bar 4, the final bear\ntrend bar in the spike. This also contributed to the profit taking by the shorts in that area as well as to the buying by the bulls.\nBar 10 was a double bottom pullback buy setup.\nOn the rally up to bar 11, the always-in trade flipped to long for more and more traders as the rally progressed. By the time the market paused at bar 12, just about everyone was\nconvinced that the bull momentum was so strong that more of a rally was likely. Once the always-in trade flips, traders should try to get into the market. If there is no pullback,\nthen buy at least a small position and use a wide stop, like below the bottom of the spike. That was what the institutions were doing. They were buying in pieces all the way up\nbecause they were not certain when a pullback would come, but they were certain that prices would be higher in the near term and wanted to be sure to profit from the strong\n", "text_clean": "Sometimes a trading range can lead to a trend reversal instead of a continuation, as it did four times on the monthly SPY chart shown in Figure PIV.9.

Since most breakout attempts fail, buying should have been expected when the market fell below the bar 9 low.\nDeeper Discussion of This Chart As shown in Figure PIV.9, traders began to flip to always-in short as the market fell below the bars 1, 2, 3 head and shoulders top. Some started shorting below the bar 3 bear trend bar and two-bar reversal that formed the lower high. Others shorted for a variety of reasons as the spike grew down to bar 4. Even though bar 5 was a bull reversal bar and a breakout above a two-bar reversal, it was the first attempt to break out above the tight bear channel down from bar 3 and therefore was likely to fail. The bulls needed more strength in the form of several bull trend bars before they would become aggressive. The bears saw bar 5 as a micro channel low 1 short and were hoping for a measured move down. The bottom at bars 8, 9, and 10 was just below a measured move down from the open of the bar 3 start of the spike to the close of bar 4, the final bear trend bar in the spike. This also contributed to the profit taking by the shorts in that area as well as to the buying by the bulls.\nBar 10 was a double bottom pullback buy setup.\nOn the rally up to bar 11, the always-in trade flipped to long for more and more traders as the rally progressed. By the time the market paused at bar 12, just about everyone was convinced that the bull momentum was so strong that more of a rally was likely. Once the always-in trade flips, traders should try to get into the market. If there is no pullback, then buy at least a small position and use a wide stop, like below the bottom of the spike. That was what the institutions were doing. They were buying in pieces all the way up because they were not certain when a pullback would come, but they were certain that prices would be higher in the near term and wanted to be sure to profit from the strong", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["Sometimes a trading range can lead to a trend reversal instead of a continuation, as it did four times on the monthly SPY chart shown in Figure", "PIV.9.

SPY traders also\nmeasured from the open of the first bar of the spike (the bar after bar 10) to the close of the second bar of the spike.

Although there are many signals, traders should not worry about catching all of them or even most of them. All a trader\nneeds is a few good setups a day to begin to become profitable.\nI have a friend who has traded for many decades and who does extremely well on days like this. I have watched him trade the Emini in real time,\nand he would take about 15 profitable one-point scalps on a day like this, all based on fades. For example, in the bar 10 to bar 18 area, he would\ntry to buy with limit orders below everything, like as the market fell below bar 10, as bar 13 went below the bear bar before it, and as bar 15 fell\nbelow the bar before it, and he would have added on as it fell below bar 13. He would have bought more as the market dipped below bar 15, and\nhe would have tried to buy if the market fell below bar 12. It is important to remember that he is a very experienced trader and has the ability to spot\ntrades that have a 70 to 80 percent chance of success. Very few traders have that ability, which is why beginners should not be scalping for one\npoint while risking about two points. At a minimum, they should take trading range trades only where they believe the probability of success of an\nequidistant move is at least 60 percent. Since they would have to risk about two points on this chart, they should trade only if they are holding for at\nleast a two-point profit. That means that they should look to buy near the bottom of the range and short near the top.\nIf traders bought near the bottom of the range, they should look to take profits near the top of the range. They should also look to initiate shorts\nnear the top of the range and take profits on those shorts when the market moves toward the bottom of the range. Reversing is too difficult for most\ntraders, and instead they should use profit targets for exits and then look for a trade in the opposite direction. For example, if they bought on bar 16\nas it went above the high of the prior bar and triggered the double bottom bull flag entry, they could have a sell limit order to exit with a 10, 15, or 20\ncent profit on the move up to bar 20. After they exited, they could then look for a short setup, like below the bar 22 lower high or below the bar 24\nlower high. The latter was a better setup because it had a strong bear reversal bar and it was a double top bear flag with bar 22.\nSo when did traders conclude that this was a trading range day? Everyone is different, but there are often clues early on, and as more\naccumulate, traders become more confident. There were signs of two-sided trading right from the first bar, and other signs accumulated on just\nabout every following bar. The first bar of the day was a doji, and that increased the chances of a trading range day. The market reversed up at bar\n3 but had weak follow-through on the move up to bar 4. The first three bars had tails at their lows, and bar 2 overlapped about half of the prior bar.\nBar 3 was a reversal down immediately after the long entry, and the next bar was a reversal up. The market reversed down again at bar 4 and up\nagain at bar 5, and down again at bar 7 at the moving average. Whenever the market has four or five reversals in the first hour, the odds of a\ntrading range day increase.\nBar 6 was a strong bull trend bar but there was no follow-through. It stalled at the moving average, and the next bar was a doji instead of another\nstrong bull trend bar with a close well above the moving average. The next bar was a bear trend bar, and the two bars after also failed to close\nabove the moving average. The bulls were not in control, despite a strong rally, so the market was two-sided.\nBar 2 was the start of a two-bar bull spike, and it was followed by a three-push bull channel up to bar 7. Since bar 2 was a strong bull reversal bar\nafter a gap down and a sell-off, it was a good opening reversal and a possible low of the day. The day could have become a strong bull trend day\nbut instead went sideways. However, it never dropped below the entry bar low.\nBar 2 was the first bar of a two-bar bull spike, and bars 4 and 7 were the second and third pushes up in a wedge channel after the spike. A\nchannel in a spike and channel pattern is the first leg of a trading range, so most traders assumed at this point that the market would be in a trading\nrange for at least the next 10 to 20 bars and maybe for the rest of the day. They looked to buy a two-legged sell-off that would test the bar 3 or bar 5\nlow, since those bars formed the bottom of the bull channel. Even if they believed that the day might become a trend day, they saw it as a trading\nrange for the time being and were therefore only scalping. Their scalping reinforced the trading range, because when lots of traders are selling near\nthe high and buying near the low, it is very difficult for the market to break out into a trend.\nTraders would have bought above bar 2 for at least a test of the moving average. Some traders would have shorted the bar 4 bear reversal bar at\nthe new high of the day, but most would have assumed that the buying pressure from the bar 2 reversal bar, the two-bar bull spike, and the bull bar\nbefore bar 4 was strong enough for the market to test the moving average, even if there was a pullback. Because of this, many traders placed limit\norders to buy at and below the bar 4 low, and they would have put their protective stops below the long entry bar after bar 2 or even below the bar 2\nsignal bar low. Some would have used a money stop, like around the height of an average bar so far today, maybe 10 to 15 cents. Some traders\nmight have thought that the bears could have made a 10 cent scalp down from bar 4. That would require a 12 cent move below bar 4, so they might\nhave used a 13-tick stop. They would have assumed that the short would have been a scalp, and therefore the bears would have had limit orders to\nbuy back their shorts at 11 cents below the bar 4 low so that they could scalp out 10 cents on the shorts that they had entered on a stop at one tick\nbelow bar 4.\nAlert traders would have placed a stop order to go long above the bear entry bar after bar 4 since they knew that the bar 4 signal bar was strong\nenough to entice shorts, and those shorts would be worried about a reversal up to the moving average. They would have their protective stops\nabove their entry bar and not look to short again until the market reached the moving average. This made buying above that entry bar a great long\nscalp.\nThe bulls doubted that the bar after bar 5 was a reliable short, so they placed orders to buy one tick above, at, and below its low, expecting it to\nbe a failed lower high. Only the long limit orders at one tick above the low got filled, which means that the bulls were very aggressive. The result was\na strong bull trend bar up to the moving average. This was a strong bull breakout, but traders wondered why it stopped at the moving average\ninstead of going far above. They needed to see immediate follow-through or they would suspect that this was going to be a failed breakout above\nthe opening high. Maybe bar 6 was just a buy vacuum caused by the strong traders temporarily stepping aside. If they assumed that the market was\ngoing to test the moving average, it made no sense for them to sell just below the moving average. The absence of strong bulls and bears allowed\nthe market to race up. However, once the market reached the area where they thought it was likely to stop, they appeared out of nowhere and sold\naggressively, overwhelming the weak bulls. The strong bulls sold out of their longs for a profit, and the strong bears sold to initiate new shorts.\nBears who saw the day as a likely trading range day would have had limit orders to sell as bar 6 moved above the moving average, while others\nwould have shorted its close. Some would have been willing to scale in higher, especially after the weak follow-through on the next bar.\nAs the market traded down, it was clear to most traders that both the bulls and the bears were strong and that the market was likely to remain\ntwo-sided as both sides fought for control. This meant that a trading range was likely. When the market got near the top, the bulls became\nconcerned that it was too expensive to buy and the bears saw it as a great value to short. This made the market fall. The bears who were eager to\nshort near the top were not interested in shorting near the bottom, so selling dried up. The bulls who were willing to buy in the middle saw the bottom\nof the range as an even better value; they bought there aggressively, lifting the market back up.\nBears were willing to short below the bar 7 test of the moving average. If the bulls were strong, there should have been a strong move above the\nmoving average and not this stall. Bar 7 made bar 6 look more like exhaustion than a strong breakout. Other bears shorted below the bar 8 ii\npattern or below the bear bar that followed bar 7. The two-bar bear spike from the ii was reasonably strong, but it had a tail at its low, indicating\nsome buying. At this point, the market had a strong spike up from the low of the day to bar 7 and now a strong spike down. Traders were expecting\n", "text_clean": "extremes and only scalp.

Most traders saw the doji inside bar before it as a bad buy signal after the bear spike, and many placed limit orders to go\nshort at the high of the doji bar. They were looking for a pullback to the area of the bottom of the bull channel around the bar 5 low. This was also in\nthe area of the bar 2 signal bar high, which was a magnet for a breakout test. The bulls wanted a double bottom bull flag to develop in the bar 3 or\nbar 5 low area, but they also wanted the original entry bar low to hold (the low of the bar after bar 2). Otherwise, they would have probably given up\non the belief that there was still a chance of a bull trend day.\nBar 10 was the third push down from the bar 7 high, and it was a strong bull trend bar. Bulls were concerned that the move down was in a tight\nchannel and that the first breakout attempt might fail. Many bulls would have waited for a breakout pullback before buying. Some who did buy\nbought a smaller position, in case the market traded down closer to the bar 3 low, and they planned to buy more on a second signal up, which they\ngot at bar 12. Others thought that many traders would have a 10 cent stop on their longs, so they placed a limit order to buy more 10 cents down,\nexactly where those weak bulls would be exiting. They then would put a protective stop on their entire position at maybe 10 more cents down, below\nthe entry bar after bar 2, or even below bar 2. The traders who were willing to risk to a new low of the day might have traded even smaller to allow\nfor a second scaled-in long about 10 cents below their first.\nThe bar 12 bull reversal bar was an approximate double bottom with the bar 3 or bar 5 low, and it was a second signal. This made it a high 2\nnear the bottom of the trading range. It was the fourth push down from the high of the day, and some traders saw it as a high 4 bull flag. The bear\nspike down after bar 8 was the first push down for many traders, and bar 12 was the third. Many spike and channel patterns end in a third push like\nthis and then try for a two-legged rally to test the top of the bear channel, which was around the bar 9 high. Some traders thought that the move\ndown to bar 12 was in too tight a channel to buy, and they would have waited for a clear second signal. Many would not have bought until they got a\nrelatively small bar near the bar 12 low. These traders could have bought on bar 16 for the double bottom bull flag. Bar 14 was strong enough to\nbreak above the bear channel, and then the market had a two-legged pullback. Bar 16 was also the entry for a wedge bull flag where bar 10 was\nthe first push down and bar 12 was the second. Others saw bar 13 as the first push down and bar 15 as the second. It was also a descending\ntriangle, and bar 16 was the breakout to the upside. Since it was a strong breakout bar, traders were looking to buy a breakout pullback. They\nwould have limit orders to buy at or below the low of the prior bar and they would have been filled on bar 18. Others would have bought the close of\nthe bear bar 17 since they thought that a breakout pullback and a higher low were more likely than a failed breakout and a move below the bar 16\nbottom of the trading range.\nTraders used that same logic and bought below the bar after bar 12, believing that it was a bad low 2 short since it was at the bottom of the\ntrading range, and it was after the second reversal up where both reversals had good buying pressure (good bull reversal bars). Some would have\nbought on the close of the bear bar after bar 12 or on the bear close of bar 13, expecting the bar 12 low to hold. Others would have bought above\nbar 13, thinking that there were trapped bears and therefore the market could move up quickly as the bears covered.\nSince this was a tight trading range, it was an area where both the bulls and the bears saw value. Both were comfortable initiating trades there. In\nan established area of value for both the bulls and the bears, breakouts usually cannot go too far before the market gets pulled back into the range.\nIt has a strong magnetic pull, and bears will short more heavily above, while bulls will buy more heavily below.\nBar 18 was a large bull trend bar that broke out above the trading range of the past hour or so. However, since the overall day was in a larger\ntrading range and the market was now in the middle of that larger range, traders were hesitant to buy. This resulted in the ii pattern. Some traders\nbought the bar 12 close and the breakout above bar 12. Others bought during the ii and above the bar 19 bull inside bar. Traders tried to buy on\nlimit orders at and below the low of the inside bar after bar 18 but they did not get filled. This made them more willing to buy the breakout above bar\n19. They saw that their buy orders did not get filled below and thought that this was a sign of urgency by the bulls.\nThe bar 18 breakout spike was followed by a small parabolic climax to bar 20 where a two-bar reversal down set up. The entry was below the\nlower of the two bars and it was not triggered until three bars later. Traders who believed that the day was a trading range day were looking to short\na strong rally to near the high of the day. Bar 21 was a small doji and therefore a weak high 1 buy setup, especially after a buy climax. Bears\nshorted above its high. Others shorted below bar 22, where the bulls were selling out of their longs. They had bought at the top of a trading range,\nhoping for a bull breakout, and when it did not happen, they were quick to exit. As they did, they triggered the two-bar reversal short at the bar 20\nhigh.\nThe market fell to the moving average and formed a high 2 buy signal with a bull reversal bar. This is a very reliable setup in a bull trend, but most\ntraders still saw the day as a trading range day. Many bought above bar 23 with the hope that the day would become a bull trend, but they planned\nto exit quickly if there was not a strong bull breakout. They were concerned that the bar after bar 23 was a doji inside bar, because they wanted a\nsense of urgency, not hesitation.\nThey exited their longs, and bears shorted below the bar 24 bear reversal bar, which formed a double top bear flag with bar 22. Some saw it as a\nlow 2 short with bar 22 and others saw it as a wedge top where bar 20 was the first push up and bar 22 was the second.\nThere was a strong bear spike to the bottom of the trading range, but bar 25 had a small bear body, indicating hesitation. The bulls were unable\nto create a breakout, and the result was only a trading range. The trading range failed to resist the magnetic pull of the bar 10 to 16 tight trading\nrange. If this was a strong bear trend, the market would not have hesitated once it got back into the tight trading range from earlier in the day.\nInstead, it would have fallen below it in a series of strong bear trend bars. This told traders that the bears were not strong and that this might just be\na sell vacuum. Strong traders might have stepped aside, expecting a test of the bottom of the range. Once the market got there, they began buying\naggressively and relentlessly, the bulls initiating new longs and the bears taking profits on their shorts. They were determined to keep the market\nabove the trading range low. Bar 26 was a high 2 at the bottom of the trading range and a strong bull reversal bar. Bar 25 was the high 1 setup. The\nbars 25 and 26 area formed a double bottom bull flag with the bars 12 to 16 area. This second bottom was also the breakout pullback from the bar\n10 to bar 17 tight trading range.\nBar 26 had good follow-through on the next bar, and traders expected this test down to fail. Some bought the close of the bar 27 bear trend bar.\nOthers placed limit orders to buy at and below the bar 27 low. The buying was so aggressive that the market could not even get to the bar 27 low.\nAlert traders saw this and quickly placed orders to buy on a stop above the bar 27 high. This resulted in a breakout formed by two bull trend bars.\nBar 28 was a bear inside bar, but the move up from bar 26 was in a tight channel so the first attempt down should fail. Bulls placed limit orders to\nbuy at and below the low of bar 28. The move down to bar 26 was a large two-legged move where bar 23 ended the first leg. This was a large bull\nflag, and the move up to bar 28 was the breakout. Bar 29 was the pullback from that breakout, and it was also the failed breakout of the bottom of\nthe micro channel from bar 26 to bar 28.\nBar 30 was a dueling lines pattern, and bulls took profits as the market went above the two lines, creating the tail at the top. Others exited on the\nweak close and still others below the bar 31 two-bar reversal top.\nBar 31 was a doji and therefore a weak high 1 signal bar. Also, the spike from bar 26 to bar 30 was not strong enough to be buying a second\n", "text_clean": "a trading range.\nBar 9 was a bull trap. Most traders saw the doji inside bar before it as a bad buy signal after the bear spike, and many placed limit orders to go short at the high of the doji bar. They were looking for a pullback to the area of the bottom of the bull channel around the bar 5 low. This was also in the area of the bar 2 signal bar high, which was a magnet for a breakout test. The bulls wanted a double bottom bull flag to develop in the bar 3 or bar 5 low area, but they also wanted the original entry bar low to hold (the low of the bar after bar 2). Otherwise, they would have probably given up on the belief that there was still a chance of a bull trend day.\nBar 10 was the third push down from the bar 7 high, and it was a strong bull trend bar. Bulls were concerned that the move down was in a tight channel and that the first breakout attempt might fail. Many bulls would have waited for a breakout pullback before buying. Some who did buy bought a smaller position, in case the market traded down closer to the bar 3 low, and they planned to buy more on a second signal up, which they got at bar 12. Others thought that many traders would have a 10 cent stop on their longs, so they placed a limit order to buy more 10 cents down, exactly where those weak bulls would be exiting. They then would put a protective stop on their entire position at maybe 10 more cents down, below the entry bar after bar 2, or even below bar 2. The traders who were willing to risk to a new low of the day might have traded even smaller to allow for a second scaled-in long about 10 cents below their first.\nThe bar 12 bull reversal bar was an approximate double bottom with the bar 3 or bar 5 low, and it was a second signal. This made it a high 2 near the bottom of the trading range. It was the fourth push down from the high of the day, and some traders saw it as a high 4 bull flag. The bear spike down after bar 8 was the first push down for many traders, and bar 12 was the third. Many spike and channel patterns end in a third push like this and then try for a two-legged rally to test the top of the bear channel, which was around the bar 9 high. Some traders thought that the move down to bar 12 was in too tight a channel to buy, and they would have waited for a clear second signal. Many would not have bought until they got a relatively small bar near the bar 12 low. These traders could have bought on bar 16 for the double bottom bull flag. Bar 14 was strong enough to break above the bear channel, and then the market had a two-legged pullback. Bar 16 was also the entry for a wedge bull flag where bar 10 was the first push down and bar 12 was the second. Others saw bar 13 as the first push down and bar 15 as the second. It was also a descending triangle, and bar 16 was the breakout to the upside. Since it was a strong breakout bar, traders were looking to buy a breakout pullback. They would have limit orders to buy at or below the low of the prior bar and they would have been filled on bar 18. Others would have bought the close of the bear bar 17 since they thought that a breakout pullback and a higher low were more likely than a failed breakout and a move below the bar 16 bottom of the trading range.\nTraders used that same logic and bought below the bar after bar 12, believing that it was a bad low 2 short since it was at the bottom of the trading range, and it was after the second reversal up where both reversals had good buying pressure (good bull reversal bars). Some would have bought on the close of the bear bar after bar 12 or on the bear close of bar 13, expecting the bar 12 low to hold. Others would have bought above bar 13, thinking that there were trapped bears and therefore the market could move up quickly as the bears covered.\nSince this was a tight trading range, it was an area where both the bulls and the bears saw value. Both were comfortable initiating trades there. In an established area of value for both the bulls and the bears, breakouts usually cannot go too far before the market gets pulled back into the range.\nIt has a strong magnetic pull, and bears will short more heavily above, while bulls will buy more heavily below.\nBar 18 was a large bull trend bar that broke out above the trading range of the past hour or so. However, since the overall day was in a larger trading range and the market was now in the middle of that larger range, traders were hesitant to buy. This resulted in the ii pattern. Some traders bought the bar 12 close and the breakout above bar 12. Others bought during the ii and above the bar 19 bull inside bar. Traders tried to buy on limit orders at and below the low of the inside bar after bar 18 but they did not get filled. This made them more willing to buy the breakout above bar 19. They saw that their buy orders did not get filled below and thought that this was a sign of urgency by the bulls.\nThe bar 18 breakout spike was followed by a small parabolic climax to bar 20 where a two-bar reversal down set up. The entry was below the lower of the two bars and it was not triggered until three bars later. Traders who believed that the day was a trading range day were looking to short a strong rally to near the high of the day. Bar 21 was a small doji and therefore a weak high 1 buy setup, especially after a buy climax. Bears shorted above its high. Others shorted below bar 22, where the bulls were selling out of their longs. They had bought at the top of a trading range, hoping for a bull breakout, and when it did not happen, they were quick to exit. As they did, they triggered the two-bar reversal short at the bar 20 high.\nThe market fell to the moving average and formed a high 2 buy signal with a bull reversal bar. This is a very reliable setup in a bull trend, but most traders still saw the day as a trading range day. Many bought above bar 23 with the hope that the day would become a bull trend, but they planned to exit quickly if there was not a strong bull breakout. They were concerned that the bar after bar 23 was a doji inside bar, because they wanted a sense of urgency, not hesitation.\nThey exited their longs, and bears shorted below the bar 24 bear reversal bar, which formed a double top bear flag with bar 22. Some saw it as a low 2 short with bar 22 and others saw it as a wedge top where bar 20 was the first push up and bar 22 was the second.\nThere was a strong bear spike to the bottom of the trading range, but bar 25 had a small bear body, indicating hesitation. The bulls were unable to create a breakout, and the result was only a trading range. The trading range failed to resist the magnetic pull of the bar 10 to 16 tight trading range. If this was a strong bear trend, the market would not have hesitated once it got back into the tight trading range from earlier in the day.\nInstead, it would have fallen below it in a series of strong bear trend bars. This told traders that the bears were not strong and that this might just be a sell vacuum. Strong traders might have stepped aside, expecting a test of the bottom of the range. Once the market got there, they began buying aggressively and relentlessly, the bulls initiating new longs and the bears taking profits on their shorts. They were determined to keep the market above the trading range low. Bar 26 was a high 2 at the bottom of the trading range and a strong bull reversal bar. Bar 25 was the high 1 setup. The bars 25 and 26 area formed a double bottom bull flag with the bars 12 to 16 area. This second bottom was also the breakout pullback from the bar 10 to bar 17 tight trading range.\nBar 26 had good follow-through on the next bar, and traders expected this test down to fail. Some bought the close of the bar 27 bear trend bar.\nOthers placed limit orders to buy at and below the bar 27 low. The buying was so aggressive that the market could not even get to the bar 27 low.\nAlert traders saw this and quickly placed orders to buy on a stop above the bar 27 high. This resulted in a breakout formed by two bull trend bars.\nBar 28 was a bear inside bar, but the move up from bar 26 was in a tight channel so the first attempt down should fail. Bulls placed limit orders to buy at and below the low of bar 28. The move down to bar 26 was a large two-legged move where bar 23 ended the first leg. This was a large bull flag, and the move up to bar 28 was the breakout. Bar 29 was the pullback from that breakout, and it was also the failed breakout of the bottom of the micro channel from bar 26 to bar 28.\nBar 30 was a dueling lines pattern, and bulls took profits as the market went above the two lines, creating the tail at the top. Others exited on the weak close and still others below the bar 31 two-bar reversal top.\nBar 31 was a doji and therefore a weak high 1 signal bar.

It is any\nsideways channel of two or more bars with lots of overlap in the bars, multiple reversals, many dojis, prominent tails, and both bull and bear bodies,\nand it can extend for a dozen or more bars. Most stop entries result in losses and should be avoided. If the average daily range in the Emini has\nbeen about 10 to 15 points, then any trading range that is three points tall or smaller is probably a tight trading range. A range of four and\nsometimes five points can sometimes behave like a tight trading range as well if the bars are large.\nThe bulls and the bears are in balance, and traders are waiting for a breakout and then the market's reaction after the breakout. Will the breakout\ncontinue, maybe after a small pullback, or will the pullback grow into a reversal and soon be followed by a breakout through the opposite side of the\ntrading range? Just because the market is sideways, do not assume that the institutions have mostly stopped trading. The volume within each bar\nusually remains high, although less than that of the bars of the trend that preceded it. The bulls and the bears are both aggressively initiating new\ntrades as they both fight to create a breakout in their direction. Some traders are scalping in and out, but others are adding to their positions and\neventually reach their maximum size. Eventually one side wins and the other side gives up, and a new trend leg begins. For example, if there is a\ntight trading range that lasts a long time and many bulls have reached a position size that they do not want to exceed, then when the market begins\nto test the bottom of the range, there are not enough bulls left to lift the market back to the middle or top of the range. The market then begins to\nbreak to the downside, and these bulls who cannot or will not increase the size of their large positions only hope that there are other bulls with\nenough buying power to reverse the bear breakout. With each new lower tick, more bulls sell out of their longs and take their losses, and they will\nnot consider buying again for at least several more bars. This selling pushes the market down further, causing more bulls to sell out with losses. The\nselling can accelerate as the remaining bulls give up, sell out, and wait for another possible bottom. This process occurs in all trading ranges, and\nalso contributes to the late breakouts in trending trading range days. For example, if there is an upside breakout, it is in part because there are too\nmany bears who are no longer able or willing to increase the size of their positions, and not enough left to resist the next test of the top of the range.\nThe market breaks out, and the bears begin to buy back their shorts and become unwilling to sell again for at least several bars. The lack of selling\nby the bears, along with their buying as they cover their shorts, creates a one-sided market that forces the remaining bears to buy back their shorts.\nThis short covering, along with buying by the bulls, often leads to a protracted bull swing.\nFailed breakouts and reversals are common. It is usually better not to enter on the breakout; instead, wait for strong follow-through and then enter\nat the market, or wait for a breakout pullback and then enter in the direction of the trend, or wait for a failed breakout and then enter in the opposite\ndirection. Although no one knows what algorithms are being used by the quants at high-frequency trading (HFT) firms, the huge volume taking place\nand the small moves with lots of reversals could easily be the result of programs trying to scalp one to four ticks repeatedly. The mathematicians do\nnot need to even look at a chart. They design programs to capitalize on small movements, and a tight trading range looks like a perfect environment\nfor a smart programmer.\nEvery pullback in a tight trading range is due to a micro buy or sell vacuum, just as occurs near the top and bottom of all trading ranges. Many\nbulls and bears will look to buy at a certain number of ticks below the high, whereas others will look to buy at a certain number of ticks below the low\nof the prior bar. These are traders who want to buy, but not at the current price. The bears want to buy back their short scalps, and the bulls want to\ninitiate buy scalps. The absence of these buyers at the current price causes the market to get sucked down. Once it reaches their price, they\nsuddenly buy aggressively, causing the reversal up. The bears take profits on their shorts and the bulls initiate longs. Once the market gets near the\ntop of the range, the process reverses. The bulls sell out of their long scalps as they take profits, and the bears initiate new shorts. This same\nprocess occurs in every type of channel, whether it is horizontal (like a tight trading range) or sloped (like a channel after a spike).\nThe math is against a trader entering and exiting on stops in a tight trading range, but determining when the trader's equation is favorable for a\nlimit order entry is too difficult for most traders. The best choice for most traders is simply to wait for the breakout and then decide if it is likely to\nsucceed or fail, and then to look for trades. This is the same for a tight channel, which is just a sloping tight trading range. Although the market\nspends most of its time in channels, whether they are sideways trading ranges or sloping channels, trading within a channel is especially difficult\nwhen the channel is tight. When a channel or trading range is tight, only the most consistently profitable traders should trade, and these traders will\nenter using limit orders. Most traders should enter almost exclusively on stops. Since that is exactly the opposite way to trade tight channels, most\ntraders should not trade them. Instead, they should simply wait for a spike or for a broader channel before trading again.\nA tight trading range is usually a continuation pattern, but if it forms after a climactic reversal, even a small one, the market has an equal\nprobability of breaking out in either direction. This is because the climactic reversal has generated momentum in the opposite direction and you will\nnot know whether this opposite momentum will continue and lead to a breakout or the momentum of the prior trend will resume. Absent a climactic\nreversal, if a tight trading range forms after a trend leg, the probability that the breakout will be in the direction of the trend can be as high as 55\npercent if the trend was strong. However, it is probably never higher than that, or else the market would not have formed the tight trading range. If the\ntrend was less strong, the probability might be only 53 percent. Even if the market breaks out against the trend, the pattern usually evolves into a\nlarger trading range, and the odds still ultimately favor a with-trend breakout. Remember, all trading ranges are just pullbacks on higher time frame\ncharts. However, if a trader enters in the direction of the trend during a tight trading range and uses a very wide stop, allowing for the evolution into a\ntaller trading range, the trader's equation becomes difficult to determine. The risk, reward, and probability become hard to assess, and whenever\nthat is the case, it is better not to trade. Therefore, using a wide stop and holding for a long time is usually not a good strategy. If a trader enters with\nthe trend in a tight trading range, expecting the trend to resume, but the market breaks out in the wrong direction, it is usually better to exit and wait\nfor a larger trading range to develop before trying again to take a with-trend swing trade.\nBecause a tight trading range is a trading range, the chance of the market selling off when it is near the top of the range or rallying when it is near\nthe bottom of the range is 60 percent or higher. However, because the range is tight, there is usually not enough room to make a profitable trade\nand, therefore, this probability is meaningless. It is better to just assume that the probability of the breakout being to the upside is 51 to 55 percent if\nthe range followed a bull leg, and that the probability of the breakout being to the downside is 51 to 55 percent if the range followed a bear leg.\nA tight trading range trumps everything, and that especially means all of the great reasons for taking any trade. It does not matter what else you\nsee on the chart.

This is because the climactic reversal has generated momentum in the opposite direction and you will not know whether this opposite momentum will continue and lead to a breakout or the momentum of the prior trend will resume. Absent a climactic reversal, if a tight trading range forms after a trend leg, the probability that the breakout will be in the direction of the trend can be as high as 55 percent if the trend was strong. However, it is probably never higher than that, or else the market would not have formed the tight trading range. If the trend was less strong, the probability might be only 53 percent. Even if the market breaks out against the trend, the pattern usually evolves into a larger trading range, and the odds still ultimately favor a with-trend breakout. Remember, all trading ranges are just pullbacks on higher time frame charts. However, if a trader enters in the direction of the trend during a tight trading range and uses a very wide stop, allowing for the evolution into a taller trading range, the trader's equation becomes difficult to determine. The risk, reward, and probability become hard to assess, and whenever that is the case, it is better not to trade. Therefore, using a wide stop and holding for a long time is usually not a good strategy. If a trader enters with the trend in a tight trading range, expecting the trend to resume, but the market breaks out in the wrong direction, it is usually better to exit and wait for a larger trading range to develop before trying again to take a with-trend swing trade.\nBecause a tight trading range is a trading range, the chance of the market selling off when it is near the top of the range or rallying when it is near the bottom of the range is 60 percent or higher. However, because the range is tight, there is usually not enough room to make a profitable trade and, therefore, this probability is meaningless. It is better to just assume that the probability of the breakout being to the upside is 51 to 55 percent if the range followed a bull leg, and that the probability of the breakout being to the downside is 51 to 55 percent if the range followed a bear leg.\nA tight trading range trumps everything, and that especially means all of the great reasons for taking any trade.

Since it is still a trading range, there is a slightly greater chance that the trend that\npreceded it will resume, but traders should assume that the odds are still only between 51 and 55 percent, depending on how strong the prior trend\nwas and whether there was a strong reversal prior to the tight trading range. A tight trading range is made of lots of reversals, and each comes from\na failed breakout attempt. There will be many “great” buy and sell signal bars, and some will have strong supporting logic. For example, if there is a\ngreat short signal that triggers, but the market forms an even better bull reversal bar within a bar or two, the bulls might think that the bears were\ntrapped by a strong signal and will therefore be unwilling to short again for at least a couple of bars. This means that there are fewer bears near-\nterm and the market has a high probability of having a successful bull breakout that runs for several bars. The logic is sound, but you need to go\nback to the mantra, “A tight trading range trumps everything.” This includes every wonderful, logical reason you have for taking a trade. The\nreversals show that the institutions are selling on limit orders above bars and buying on limit orders below bars. Your job is to follow what they are\ndoing, and you should never do the opposite. Entering and exiting on stops in a tight trading range is a losing strategy. Since you cannot profitably\nscalp for one to three ticks in a tight trading range the way the high frequency trading firms are doing, you have to wait. They create most of the\nvolume in these tight ranges, and they are trading in ways that you cannot trade profitably. You have to wait, which can be extremely difficult to do.\nSometimes a tight trading range can extend to 20 or more bars, and it then truly becomes a setup with no predictive value. Since guessing is never\na sensible approach to trading, price action traders have to wait for the breakout before deciding what to do. In the majority of cases, there is a\nfailure within a bar or two of the breakout, and the odds of a profitable trade are higher if you base your entry on the failure rather than on the\nbreakout. In most cases, the reversal attempt fails and becomes a breakout pullback. Once there is a pullback from the breakout, enter in the\ndirection of the breakout on a stop as the breakout resumes. In a bull breakout, wait for the pullback bar to close and then enter on a buy stop at one\ntick above its high. If the expected pullback bar instead leads to a reversal and plunges through the opposite side of the tight trading range, or if one\nof the next couple of bars falls through the bottom of the range, you can enter short on a stop at one tick below the tight trading range, or you can\nwait for a breakout pullback to short.\nBecause the move after the breakout from a protracted tight trading range on a trading range day is often not strong, the market frequently\nremains largely trendless for the rest of the day. However, the market behaves very differently if there was a strong trend leading up to the tight\ntrading range, because the day will often become a trend resumption day. Here, there is a strong trend for the first hour or so and then a tight\ntrading range that can last for several hours, and finally a breakout from the range in the direction of the original trend. This breakout often leads to a\nsecond trend that will be about the same number of points as the first leg. Less often, the breakout will be in the opposite direction and reverse\nmost or all of the earlier trend.\nTight trading ranges usually have setups in both directions within them, but most traders should not take any trades once they believe that the\nmarket has entered a tight trading range. If they just entered a position and the pattern grows into a tight trading range, the best option is to try to\nget out at breakeven or maybe with a tick loss, and then wait for the breakout before deciding on your next trade. For example, if traders shorted\nbecause they thought there was a 60 percent chance that the market would fall 10 ticks before rallying 10 ticks but now the market is in a tight\ntrading range, the math has changed. The traders now have only about a 50 percent chance of success, and as long as their risk and potential\nreward are unchanged, they now have a losing strategy. Their best recourse is to exit at breakeven and, if they are lucky, they might be able to get\nout with a tick or two of profit.\nNo matter what patterns you see, and there are always great-looking ones as they are setting up, you have to factor in the probability, which is 50\npercent for an equidistant move. You can trade profitably only if the chance of winning times the potential reward is significantly greater than the\nchance of losing times the risk, but since a tight trading range is such a strong magnet, the moves are small within it, breakouts usually fail, and\neven when a breakout succeeds, it usually does not go far before the range sucks the market back into it. This makes the chance of making two or\nthree times your risk very small; therefore, any breakout strategy, like buying above a bar or shorting below a bar, will lose over time.\nSince a tight trading range is a channel, it can be traded like any other channel, but because the moves are small and take many bars to reach a\nprofit target, it is very tedious, and most traders should avoid any trading once they believe that the market has entered a tight trading range.\nSometimes a tight trading range has enough points from top to bottom to short a small bear reversal bar at the top for a scalp or to buy above a\nsmall bull trend bar at the bottom. Aggressive traders are buying below the low of the prior bar or shorting above the high of the prior bar, and are\nscalping out with a small profit. If there was a trend leading up to the tight trading range, the with-trend trades are more likely to be winners and a\npart can be held for a swing. For example, if the market enters a tight trading range after a strong rally and the range is holding just above the\nmoving average, bulls will be buying below the lows of the prior bars. Although they can scalp out near the top of the range, they can also hold a part\nof their position for a swing up. Other traders (mostly HFT firms) scale into longs below the middle of the range and every one or two ticks lower.\nShorts sell above the middle of the range and every tick or two higher. Both take profits around the middle of the range, exiting at breakeven on\ntheir earliest entry and with a profit on their later entries.\nSince traders should focus on only the very best setups, they should always avoid the worst; and a tight trading range is the worst. Tight trading\nranges are the single biggest problem for beginning traders and by far the most important obstacle that prevents them from trading profitably. For\nexample, new traders remember that bar counts have been very reliable during the trends of the past few days so they start using them for entries\nwithin the range, expecting a breakout soon, but one never comes. They see every reversal as a new signal, and each one looks good at the time\nthey place their order. There might be a strong bear reversal bar breaking out of a good-looking low 2 short setup. But it is still within the tight\ntrading range and follows 14 bars that overlap, and the moving average is flat. Within the range, there might have been six prior reversals and none\nmoved far enough to make even a scalper's profit. After an hour or so, the traders become depressed because they see that they have just lost on\nsix consecutive trades. Even though the losses were small, they are now down seven points and there is only an hour remaining in the day. In a\ncouple of hours, they gave back everything that they had earned over the past three days, and they promise themselves that they will never make\nthat mistake again. Invariably, though, they do it again in two days, and then at least a couple of times a week for months until there is too little\nmargin left in their accounts to trade.\nThat original money in their accounts was a gift to themselves. They were giving themselves an opportunity to see if they could create a new,\nwonderful life for themselves and their families. However, they repeatedly allowed themselves to break the most important rule in trading by trading\nwithin a tight trading range. They were arrogant to believe that their ability to read the market was strong. After all, they had made money for three\nconsecutive days, and they had to be skillful to accomplish that. They believed that a winner was overdue after six consecutive losers, so the law of\naverages was on their side. Instead, they should have accepted the reality that a winner is never overdue, and the market usually continues to do\nwhat it just did. That means a seventh loser is more likely than a winner, and there will not likely be very good trading for the rest of the day. Yes, they\ntraded those big swings of the past few days extremely well, but the character of the market changes from day to day, and that requires you to\nchange your approach.\nTraders often do not accept that the market has entered a tight trading range until they lose on two or three signals within four or five bars, and\n", "text_clean": "breakout in either direction is never more than about 55 percent.

There is a natural tendency to assume that nothing can last forever and that every\nbehavior regresses toward a mean. If the market has three or four losing trades, surely the odds favor that the next one will be a winner. It's just like\nflipping a coin, isn't it? Unfortunately, that is not how markets behave. When a market is trending, most attempts to reverse fail. When it is in a\ntrading range, most attempts to break out fail. This is the opposite of coin flips, where the odds are always 50–50. In trading, the odds are more like\n70 percent or better that what just happened will continue to happen again and again. Because of the coin flip logic, most traders at some point\nbegin to consider game theory.\nThe first idea that they consider is a martingale approach where they double or triple the size of their next trade after each loss. If they try it, they\nsoon see that the martingale approach is really the martingale paradox. If you start with one contract and then after a loss you trade two contracts,\nand you keep doubling your position size after each consecutive losing trade, you know that eventually you will win. Once you do, that large final bet\nwill recover all of your earlier losses and bring you back to breakeven. Better yet, triple the size of your trade after each loser so that once you finally\nwin, you will end up with a net profit, despite your earlier losses. Martingale approaches are mathematically sound but paradoxically impossible to\napply. Why is that? If you start with one contract and double after six consecutive losses, you would then be trading 32 contracts. If you trade every\nreversal, you will have six consecutive losers at least once a week and often more than six. The paradox is that a trader who is comfortable trading\none contract would never trade 32 contracts, and a trader who is comfortable trading 32 contracts would never start with one.\nTraders next consider waiting for three (or even more) consecutive losers before taking a trade because they believe that a string of four\nconsecutive losing scalps does not happen too often. In fact, it happens almost every day, and the market often has six or even more consecutive\nreversals that fail; when that happens, the market is always in a tight trading range. Once they discover just how common six or seven consecutive\nlosers are, they abandon that approach.\nOnce you see that the market is in a tight trading range, don't trade. Instead, simply wait for good swings to return, and they will, usually by the\nnext day. Your job is not to place trades. It has to be to make money, and you cannot make money every month if you continue to lose more than you\nmake. If the market appears to be swinging up and down and you take a trade, but the market then begins to form small, overlapping dojis within\nthe next few bars, assume that the market is entering a tight trading range, especially if it is now the middle third of the day. Try to get out at\nbreakeven or with a small loss and just wait for swings to return, even if you have to wait until tomorrow. You cannot afford to give back money\nbased on the assumption that losers are part of trading. You must restrict your trading to the very best setups, even if that means that you don't trade\nfor hours at a time.\nAn alternative to trying to get out at breakeven is to hold but use a wide stop beyond the range, but this is a less sound approach mathematically.\nThe worst alternative is to take several entries within the pattern and sustain losses, even small ones. If you bought in a tight trading range in a bear\ntrend and the market formed a low 2, you should exit and possibly reverse to short. If you shorted in that bear tight trading range and the market then\nformed a high 2, you should exit and possibly reverse to long, but only if the signal bar is a bull bar at the bottom of the range and there is enough\nroom to the top of the pattern for a scalper's profit. However, this is rarely a good trade and only very experienced traders should attempt it. It is very\ndifficult to watch the market for a couple of hours and not take a trade, but that is far better than incurring three or four losses and running out of time\nin the day to get back to breakeven. Be patient. Good setups will return before long.\nAn important type of tight trading range usually occurs in the middle of the day, in the middle of the day's range, and usually near the moving\naverage, but it can occur at any time and in any location. It is called barbwire because of the spiky appearance of the large dojis and tails. If you see\nthree or more bars that largely overlap and one or more of them has a tiny body (doji), this is barbwire. As a guide for how much overlap is enough,\nlook at the second of the three bars. Usually the bars are relatively large, which signifies more emotion and more uncertainty. If more than half of its\nheight is within the range of the bars before and after it, you should view the three bars as barbwire. Until you are a strong trader, don't touch\nbarbwire or you will be hurt. The small body indicates that the market moved away from the bar's open, but traders with an opposite opinion moved\nit back by the close of the bar. Also, sideways bars where one bar overlaps much of the prior bar mean that no one is in control of the market, so\nyou should not bet on the direction.\nAs with all trading ranges, the odds favor a with-trend breakout, but barbwire is notorious for sharp whipsaws and repeated losses for overly\neager breakout traders. Barbwire often has both a failed low 2 and a failed high 2 before there is a successful breakout. In general, when barbwire\nforms adjacent to the moving average, it will usually break out in the direction away from the moving average. So if it forms just above the moving\naverage, the odds favor a bull breakout, and if it forms just below the moving average, there will usually be a bear breakout. In the less common\nsituation where it is straddling the moving average, you have to look to other aspects of price action to find tradable setups. Since all tight trading\nranges are areas of agreement between the bulls and the bears, most breakouts fail. In fact, when a tight trading range occurs in a trend, it often\nbecomes the final flag in the trend, and the breakout often reverses back into the tight trading range. The reversal usually leads to at least a two-\nlegged pullback and sometimes even a trend reversal.\nIt is important to consider the move just prior its formation. If the barbwire develops in a pullback to the moving average but stays mostly on the\nwith-trend side of the moving average, it is just part of the pullback and there will usually be a with-trend breakout. For example, if there is a 10-bar\npullback to the moving average in a bull trend and then barbwire forms, with several bars poking through the moving average, but the pattern is\nmostly above the moving average, look for a bull breakout. Even though you might want to consider the 10-bar move down to the moving average\nas a new bear trend, if the pattern is mostly above the moving average, the bulls are in control and it is likely just the end of a bull pullback to the\nmoving average.\nHowever, if the pullback goes through the moving average and then the barbwire forms mostly on the opposite side of the moving average, this\npullback has enough strength so that either a second leg is likely or you misread the chart and the trend might have already reversed. In either case,\nthe breakout will likely be in the direction of the move that led to the pattern, rather than in the direction of the larger move that was in effect prior to\nthis moving average pullback. For example, if there was a bear trend and now there is a 10-bar rally that poked above the moving average and is\nforming barbwire that is mostly above the moving average, the odds favor a bull breakout. The barbwire is a bull flag in the move up and not the end\nof a bear flag in the larger move down.\nAs difficult as barbwire can be to trade, if you analyze the bars carefully, experienced traders can trade it effectively. This is important because it\nis sometimes followed by a protracted trend move, especially when it is acting as a breakout pullback. For example, suppose the market is selling\noff to the bottom of a trading range and barbwire forms; if a low 2 develops just below the moving average and the signal bar is a strong bear\nreversal bar, this can be a strong short setup. The odds favor a successful breakout if the tails within the barbwire are not too prominent, there was\na strong reversal at the top of this bear leg, and there are reasonable targets well below the barbwire.\nSometimes barbwire forms at the end of a several-bar spike in the first hour. When it happens in an area of support in a bull trend, it can become\na reversal pattern and the low of the day. When this happens after a bull spike in the first hour at an area of resistance, it can become the high of the\nday. Barbwire less often forms reversal patterns later in the day.\n", "text_clean": "even once they do, they make even more costly mistakes. There is a natural tendency to assume that nothing can last forever and that every behavior regresses toward a mean. If the market has three or four losing trades, surely the odds favor that the next one will be a winner. It's just like flipping a coin, isn't it? Unfortunately, that is not how markets behave. When a market is trending, most attempts to reverse fail. When it is in a trading range, most attempts to break out fail. This is the opposite of coin flips, where the odds are always 50–50. In trading, the odds are more like 70 percent or better that what just happened will continue to happen again and again. Because of the coin flip logic, most traders at some point begin to consider game theory.\nThe first idea that they consider is a martingale approach where they double or triple the size of their next trade after each loss. If they try it, they soon see that the martingale approach is really the martingale paradox. If you start with one contract and then after a loss you trade two contracts, and you keep doubling your position size after each consecutive losing trade, you know that eventually you will win. Once you do, that large final bet will recover all of your earlier losses and bring you back to breakeven. Better yet, triple the size of your trade after each loser so that once you finally win, you will end up with a net profit, despite your earlier losses. Martingale approaches are mathematically sound but paradoxically impossible to apply. Why is that? If you start with one contract and double after six consecutive losses, you would then be trading 32 contracts. If you trade every reversal, you will have six consecutive losers at least once a week and often more than six. The paradox is that a trader who is comfortable trading one contract would never trade 32 contracts, and a trader who is comfortable trading 32 contracts would never start with one.\nTraders next consider waiting for three (or even more) consecutive losers before taking a trade because they believe that a string of four consecutive losing scalps does not happen too often. In fact, it happens almost every day, and the market often has six or even more consecutive reversals that fail; when that happens, the market is always in a tight trading range. Once they discover just how common six or seven consecutive losers are, they abandon that approach.\nOnce you see that the market is in a tight trading range, don't trade. Instead, simply wait for good swings to return, and they will, usually by the next day. Your job is not to place trades. It has to be to make money, and you cannot make money every month if you continue to lose more than you make. If the market appears to be swinging up and down and you take a trade, but the market then begins to form small, overlapping dojis within the next few bars, assume that the market is entering a tight trading range, especially if it is now the middle third of the day. Try to get out at breakeven or with a small loss and just wait for swings to return, even if you have to wait until tomorrow. You cannot afford to give back money based on the assumption that losers are part of trading. You must restrict your trading to the very best setups, even if that means that you don't trade for hours at a time.\nAn alternative to trying to get out at breakeven is to hold but use a wide stop beyond the range, but this is a less sound approach mathematically.\nThe worst alternative is to take several entries within the pattern and sustain losses, even small ones. If you bought in a tight trading range in a bear trend and the market formed a low 2, you should exit and possibly reverse to short. If you shorted in that bear tight trading range and the market then formed a high 2, you should exit and possibly reverse to long, but only if the signal bar is a bull bar at the bottom of the range and there is enough room to the top of the pattern for a scalper's profit. However, this is rarely a good trade and only very experienced traders should attempt it. It is very difficult to watch the market for a couple of hours and not take a trade, but that is far better than incurring three or four losses and running out of time in the day to get back to breakeven. Be patient. Good setups will return before long.\nAn important type of tight trading range usually occurs in the middle of the day, in the middle of the day's range, and usually near the moving average, but it can occur at any time and in any location. It is called barbwire because of the spiky appearance of the large dojis and tails. If you see three or more bars that largely overlap and one or more of them has a tiny body (doji), this is barbwire. As a guide for how much overlap is enough, look at the second of the three bars. Usually the bars are relatively large, which signifies more emotion and more uncertainty. If more than half of its height is within the range of the bars before and after it, you should view the three bars as barbwire. Until you are a strong trader, don't touch barbwire or you will be hurt. The small body indicates that the market moved away from the bar's open, but traders with an opposite opinion moved it back by the close of the bar. Also, sideways bars where one bar overlaps much of the prior bar mean that no one is in control of the market, so you should not bet on the direction.\nAs with all trading ranges, the odds favor a with-trend breakout, but barbwire is notorious for sharp whipsaws and repeated losses for overly eager breakout traders. Barbwire often has both a failed low 2 and a failed high 2 before there is a successful breakout. In general, when barbwire forms adjacent to the moving average, it will usually break out in the direction away from the moving average. So if it forms just above the moving average, the odds favor a bull breakout, and if it forms just below the moving average, there will usually be a bear breakout. In the less common situation where it is straddling the moving average, you have to look to other aspects of price action to find tradable setups. Since all tight trading ranges are areas of agreement between the bulls and the bears, most breakouts fail. In fact, when a tight trading range occurs in a trend, it often becomes the final flag in the trend, and the breakout often reverses back into the tight trading range. The reversal usually leads to at least a twolegged pullback and sometimes even a trend reversal.\nIt is important to consider the move just prior its formation. If the barbwire develops in a pullback to the moving average but stays mostly on the with-trend side of the moving average, it is just part of the pullback and there will usually be a with-trend breakout. For example, if there is a 10-bar pullback to the moving average in a bull trend and then barbwire forms, with several bars poking through the moving average, but the pattern is mostly above the moving average, look for a bull breakout. Even though you might want to consider the 10-bar move down to the moving average as a new bear trend, if the pattern is mostly above the moving average, the bulls are in control and it is likely just the end of a bull pullback to the moving average.\nHowever, if the pullback goes through the moving average and then the barbwire forms mostly on the opposite side of the moving average, this pullback has enough strength so that either a second leg is likely or you misread the chart and the trend might have already reversed.

Instead, wait for a trend bar to break out of the pattern. The trend bar is\nthe first sign of conviction but, since the market has been two-sided, the odds are high that the breakout will fail, so be ready to fade it. For\nexample, if there is a bull trend bar that breaks out to the upside by more than a couple of ticks, as soon as the bull trend bar closes, place an order\nto go short at one tick below the low of that breakout bar. Sometimes this short entry will fail, so once short and once the entry bar closes, place an\norder to reverse to long at one tick above the high of the short entry bar, which would become a breakout pullback buy entry. It is unusual for the\nsecond entry to fail. Do not fade the breakout if it has two or more consecutive trend bars, because that increases the odds that the breakout will be\nsuccessful. This means that any attempt to reverse back into the barbwire will probably fail and set up a breakout pullback. Once the market begins\nto form trend bars, either the bulls or the bears will soon be in control. When a with-trend breakout fails within a few bars and the market reverses,\nthe barbwire is then the final flag of the prior trend.\nYou can also fade small bars near the top and bottom of barbwire if there is an entry. For example, if there is a small bar near the high, especially\nif it is a bear reversal bar, look to scalp a short with an entry order to sell at one tick below the low of that bar on a stop. You can also look for 3\nminute small bars to fade as well. You should rarely, if ever, fade off 1 minute bars, because the 3 and 5 minute bars provide better winning\npercentages.\nSince barbwire can have many spikes before there is a successful breakout, experienced traders sometimes place limit orders to buy below the\nlow of the prior bar if that low is near the bottom of the range but not if it is in the middle or top of the range. Bears will short above the high of the\nprior bar with an entry near the top of the range, rather than at the high of a prior bar where the high is in the bottom half of the range. The more\nprominent the spikes are, the more likely this is to work. Also, it is more effective if the bars are at least as large as the average bars of the day. If\nthe bars are too small and the range is too tight, then the odds of a successful scalp are less, and traders should wait to place trades. This is\ntedious work, and most experienced traders usually wait for moves with a higher probability of success and more profit potential.

For example, if there is a pullback to the moving average in a bull trend, you would buy a high 2 even if it is forming within barbwire. This is\nespecially true if the signal bar is a bull reversal bar and if dojis and tails are not too prominent in the barbwire. You must look at the entire chart and\nsee the bull trend. Do not simply look at the prior 10 bars and conclude that the market is now in a bear swing, which is not realistic if the market is\nholding above a rising moving average in a strong bull trend.\nWhenever you are not certain, the best course is always to wait, which is difficult to do when you feel like an entry is overdue. However, that is\nwhat a smart trader always does because it simply does not make sense to trade low-probability setups. One very good rule is that if there is a\ntrading range setting up and it is near the moving average, never look to buy if the bars are mostly below the moving average, and never look to sell\nif the bars are mostly above the moving average. This one rule will save you an enormous amount of money over the years.\nMicro channels sometimes have barbwire behavior. For example, on a bear trend day, it is common to see a small rally within a micro channel.\nThen there might be a downside breakout that fails within a bar or two. This is not a buy setup since it almost always will be below a falling moving\naverage on a bear trend day and you need to be looking for short setups only when the market rallies for five to 10 bars. Wait for the failed breakout\nto form a higher high or a lower high breakout pullback and then look to go short below that bar. You will be shorting exactly where the trapped bulls\nwho bought above the bar that broke below the bull channel will be taking their losses. These patterns often have tails and can be barbwire, and\nthey trap countertrend traders, just like barbwire.\nFigure 22.1 Tight Trading Range\nBy bar 4 in Figure 22.1, it was clear that the market had entered a tight trading range. Bar 1 was the second attempt to reverse down within three\nbars and was followed by the bar 2 attempt to reverse up in a two-bar reversal. Three changes in direction within five bars are a strong sign that the\nmarket was now strongly two-sided. When the market formed a small doji after bar 3, traders had to suspect that it was likely entering a tight trading\nrange. When the next two bars were also dojis, a tight trading range was in effect.\nBoth bars 5 and 6 failed to break out of the top, and the tight trading range evolved into a triangle, which is also usually a with-trend pattern.

Also, bar 7 was a high 2 pullback from the bar 5 high,\nwhich had some momentum. An aggressive trader would have bought the high 2.\nThe next logical buy was a breakout above the high 2 of bar 5, the first failed breakout.

But if you look carefully at the barbwire from bar 1 to bar 2, there were eight\nconsecutive reversals that failed to reach a scalper's profit. Once you see overlapping bars near the moving average, you need to be very careful. In\ngeneral, it is best to consider only with-trend entries (here, longs, since the pattern is mostly above the exponential moving average), and only if you\ncan buy near the bottom of the pattern or after one side is clearly trapped. Although the tails are not as big and the bodies are not as small as in\nmost barbwire patterns, overlapping bars at the moving average create a dangerous situation.\nOn a 15 minute chart, this 5 minute barbwire is simply a high 2 pullback to the moving average, and it is certainly reasonable to trade off the 15\nminute chart when there is a 5 minute barbwire pattern. The best approach for most traders is simply to wait and not trade until after the pattern has\nbroken out and a new pattern sets up. In some cases, like here, there is no low-risk setup. Bar 2 was a bad short since traders were shorting below\na large signal bar at the bottom of a trading range in a bull day. Also, a bear reversal bar in a tight trading range has nothing to reverse, so it does\nnot function as a reversal bar. Here it was the first bar of a two-bar reversal up. The outside up bar was the second and the entry was above the\nhigh of the outside up bar, which was the higher of the two bars. Just because something looks like a reversal bar does not mean that it will function\nlike one. Also, something can function like a perfect two-bar reversal even if it does not look like one. Traders who are constantly thinking about\nwhat is going on can catch these trades. It is likely that the chart would look different on other time frames—that the bear reversal bar would not exit\nand the two-bar reversal would look perfect. However, you never have to look for the perfect time frame if you understand what is happening on the\nchart in front of you.\nFigure 22.5 Stop Entries Would Have Yielded 10 Consecutive Losers\nTen consecutive losing scalps should be a warning to traders who think they can make money by trading in barbwire. This is an extreme example of\nthe trouble that traders can have if they choose not to work hard to understand price action and instead decide to trade entirely mechanically,\nreversing at each bar that reverses the prior bar. In Figure 22.5, bar 1 was a long scalp that would have resulted in a loss. If traders reversed to\nshort on bar 2, they would have lost again. If they kept reversing after each loss, they would have had 10 consecutive losing entries, the last\noccurring at the bar 10 short. If their first position size was a single contract and they used a martingale approach of doubling their position size\nafter each loss so that when they finally won they would be back to breakeven, that 11th entry would have required them to trade 1,024 contracts,\nand what one-lot trader would ever be able to do that? If they took a more aggressive martingale approach and decided to triple their position size\nafter each loss so that when they finally had a winning scalp they would have a profit despite all of the earlier consecutive losers, their second trade\nwould be for three contracts, their third would be for nine, and their 11th entry would be for 37,179 contracts! That is why martingale techniques are\nnot practical. If your account is big enough to trade 1,024 contracts, you would never bother trading just one contract on your first trade, and if you\nare comfortable starting out with just one lot, you could never trade 1,024 contracts.\nOn this summer Friday, there were also eight consecutive losers starting at the long at bar A and ending with the short at bar B.\nTraders could instead begin trading after four or five losers and increase their odds of success and reduce their overall risk, but this should be\ndone only rarely and only by traders who can read price action quickly and accurately.

Anyone blindly doubling up after consecutive losers is gambling and not trading, and\ngambling is entertainment, which always involves a fee. None of the 10 losing trades had a strong enough setup to be traded in barbwire, and\ntherefore it would have been better to wait.

The minimum requirement\nfor a trading range to be called a triangle is that it has three pushes up or down. Since they have either higher lows or lower highs, or both in the\ncase of an expanding triangle, they also have some trending behavior. Wedges are triangles that are either rising or falling. When they are just\nbarely sloped, traders refer to them as triangles, but when the slope is greater, they usually call them wedges. A bull or bear flag can be a wedge\nand will usually just become a continuation pattern. Wedges can also occur at the end of a trend and form a reversal pattern. Because they behave\nmore like flags or reversal patterns than like traditional triangles, they are discussed in those sections rather than here.\nAn expanding triangle is contained between two diverging lines, both of which are technically trend channel lines because the upper line is above\nthe highs in a bull trend (higher highs) and the lower line is below the lows in a bear trend (lower lows). An oo (outside-outside) pattern, where an\noutside bar is followed by a larger outside bar, is a small expanding triangle. A contracting triangle is contained between two trend lines, since the\nmarket is in both a small bear trend and a small bull trend. An ii pattern is usually a small triangle on a lower time frame chart. An ascending triangle\nhas a resistance line above and a bull trend line below; a descending triangle has a support line below and a bear trend line above. A wedge is an\nascending or descending channel where the trend line and trend channel line converge, and it is a variant of a triangle and therefore also a type of\nchannel. All triangles have at least three legs in one direction and at least two in the other, and every pattern that has three legs and is sideways or\nsloped and shaped like a wedge is a triangle. Unlike trend channels and trading ranges that can extend indefinitely, when the market is in a triangle,\nit is in breakout mode, meaning that a breakout is imminent. The breakout can be strong or weak; it can have follow-through and result in a trend, or\nit can fail and reverse, or it can simply go sideways and evolve into a larger trading range.\nLike all trading ranges, a triangle is a pause in a trend, and the breakout is usually in the direction of the trend that preceded it. A triangle in a bull\ntrend usually breaks out to the upside, and a bear triangle usually breaks out to the downside. Wedges can be more complicated. A bear wedge is\na downward-sloping wedge and, like all bear channels, is a bull flag. When a downward-sloping wedge occurs within a larger bull trend, an upside\nbreakout is in the direction of the larger trend, as expected. However, a large bear wedge can fill the entire screen, in which case the bars on the\nscreen are in a bear trend. The upside breakout is then a reversal and a breakout against the trend on the screen. Whether or not there is a clear,\nlarge bull trend just off the left side of the screen is irrelevant. Any down wedge will behave like a large pullback in a bull trend, which means that it\nwill behave like a bull flag. An upside breakout is a reversal out of the bear trend on the screen, but it is in the expected direction, since every bear\nchannel, whether or not the lines converge and create a wedge, functions like a bull flag and should be thought of as a bull flag. Most, in fact, are bull\nflags on a larger time frame chart.\nEvery trading range with three pushes is functionally identical to a triangle. Most are triangles, but some don't have a clear triangle shape.\nHowever, since they behave exactly like triangles, they should be traded as if they were perfect triangles. Because they are more complex than one-\npush pullbacks (high 1 and low 1 pullbacks) and two-push pullbacks (high 2 and low 2 pullbacks), they represent stronger countertrend pressure.\nSince traders in the opposite direction are getting stronger, these patterns tend to occur late in trends and swings, and often become final flags. If a\ntriangle has more than three pushes, most traders begin to refer to the correction as a trading range.\nIf a pattern is sloping and has three pushes, many traders erroneously see it as a wedge and look for a reversal. However, as discussed in\nChapter 18 on wedges, if the three-push pattern is in a tight channel, the pattern will usually function like a channel and continue indefinitely, and not\nfunction like a wedge and reverse. If a wedge has three pushes, that alone is not a reason to trade in the opposite direction, however. When traders\nare not certain if the wedge is about to reverse, they should not enter on the breakout. For example, if there is a down channel that is fairly steep\nand the trend and trend channel lines are convergent but fairly close together, traders should not buy the first reversal up or the bull breakout of the\nwedge. They should wait until the bull breakout occurs and then evaluate its strength. If the breakout is strong (the characteristics of strong\nbreakouts are discussed in Chapter 2), they should wait for a pullback and then enter at the end of the pullback (a breakout pullback buy). If there is\nno pullback for several bars, then the market is forming a strong bull spike and has almost certainly become always-in long in the eyes of most\ntraders. They can then trade it like they would any other strong breakout. They might buy the close of a bar, buy above the high of the prior bar, buy\nany small pullback on a limit order, or wait for a pullback.\nSince most triangles are relatively horizontal, the bulls and the bears are in balance, which means that they both see value at this price level.\nBecause of this, breakouts often do not go very far before reversing back into the range, and triangles are often the final flag in a trend. If the\nbreakout fails, the market usually gets drawn back into the trading range and sometimes breaks out of the opposite side and becomes a two-\nlegged correction or even a trend reversal. This trading range behavior is discussed more in the Part IV discussion on trading ranges.\nSince ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles have the same trading implications, it is not necessary to distinguish one from another,\nand they can all be referred to as triangles. All of these triangles are mostly horizontal. They tend to break out slightly more often in the direction of\nthe trend that preceded them, but not enough to place a trade on that basis alone. Since each is a type of trading range, each is an area of\nuncertainty, and it is better to wait for the breakout before placing a trade. However, when the pattern is tall enough, you can trade it like a trading\nrange and fade the extremes, looking to buy near the bottom and sell near the top. The breakouts often fail and, like breakouts from any channel, if\nthe market reverses back into the channel, it usually tests the opposite side. If it breaks out in either direction, the breakout usually leads to a\nmeasured move approximately equal in points to the height of the channel. If it goes beyond that, the market is likely in a trend.\nExpanding triangles can be reversal patterns at the end of a trend or continuation patterns within a trend. Once they break out, the breakout often\nfails and the market then reverses, breaks out of the other side, and forms an even larger expanding triangle. The expanding triangle reversal then\nbecomes a continuation pattern, and an expanding triangle continuation pattern then becomes a reversal. For example, if there is an expanding\ntriangle at the bottom of a bear trend, it is a reversal pattern. Once the market rallies and breaks out of the top of the triangle, the breakout often\nfails and the market then turns down again. The result is a large expanding triangle bear flag. Sometimes an expanding triangle can lead to a major\nreversal, but usually it behaves more like a trading range and evolves into some other pattern. They are discussed more in the chapter on trend\nreversal patterns in book 3.\nFigure 23.1 There Are Many Ways to Draw Triangles\n", "text_clean": "Chapter 23\nTriangles Triangles are trading ranges and therefore channels, since they are an area of price action contained between two lines.

Investors will often add to their positions if the stock goes against them, since their\nbelief is that the stock is a value at the current price. A trader is someone who trades off daily charts and short-term fundamental events like\nearnings reports and product announcements with the intention of capturing a quick move, lasting from one to several days. Traders will take partial\nprofits at the first pause and then move their stops to breakeven on the balance; they are not willing to have a profit turn into a loss. Traders are\nsometimes referred to as scalpers, but that term more commonly is used to refer to a type of day trader. Incidentally, it is important to keep to your\ntime frame. A common cause of losses is putting on a trade, watching it become a loser, not exiting at your planned stop, and instead convincing\nyourself that it is fine to convert the trade into an investment. If you put it on for a trade, exit it as a trade and take the loss. Otherwise, you will\ninvariably hold it far too long, and the loss will become many times larger than your original worst-case loss. On top of that, it will be a constant\ndistraction and interfere with your ability to place and manage other trades.\nIn the eyes of a trader or investor using daily to monthly time frames, all day trading is scalping. However, to day traders, scalping is holding a\nposition for one to 15 minutes or so and usually exiting on a limit order at a profit target in an attempt to capture one small leg on whatever time\nframe the scalper is using for trades. In general, the potential reward (the number of ticks to the profit target) is about the size of the risk (the number\nof ticks to the protective stop). The scalper does not want any pullbacks and will quickly exit at breakeven if the trade comes back before the target\nis reached; the scalper is therefore comparable to a trader on the daily charts. Intraday swing traders will hold a trade through pullbacks. They try to\ncapture the two to four larger swings of the day, holding each position from 15 minutes to an entire day. Their potential reward is usually at least\ntwice as large as their risk. They are comparable to an investor on the daily charts, who is willing to hold a position through pullbacks.\nIn the 1990s, the media and institutional investors ridiculed day traders, who were mostly scalpers, as gamblers who served no useful purpose.\nThe critics totally ignored one important function that all traders provide, which is increasing liquidity and therefore reducing bid-ask spreads,\nmaking trading cheaper for everyone. A good deal of the criticism was probably due to the established institutional investors on Wall Street. They\nbelieved that they owned the game and they were kings, and they did not respect anyone who did not play it their way. They worked hard for their\nMBAs and thought that it was unfair that a high school dropout could theoretically make a fortune after spending just a few months learning simple\ntrading techniques. The institutions enjoyed the awe that their feats garnered from the adoring public and at some level resented the attention that\nthese uneducated upstarts were getting. Once HFT firms became the biggest volume traders on the Street and were producing far better\nperformance records than the traditional institutional investors, the media took notice and began to give them more attention and respectful awe\nthan the dinosaurs who had ruled the Street since its creation. HFT firms are the ultimate day traders and have made day trading respectable.\nCNBC's Fast Money has traders every day who often scalp, and are presented as admirable, successful traders. Now, the general feeling is that it\nis very difficult to make money as a trader, and if you are able to do it, you deserve a lot of respect, especially from other traders. It does not matter\nhow you trade. All that matters is performance, and this is how it should be in a capitalistic society. Successful investors, traders, intraday swing\ntraders, and scalpers all deserve the same respect and admiration, because all are doing something special, and doing it very well takes an\nextraordinary talent and a lot of hard work.\nAs discussed in Chapter 25 in the section on the trader's equation, swing traders take the opposite side of all scalps, but they also take the other\nside of trades by traders swinging in the opposite direction. A scalper has a reward about the same size as his risk and a high probability. There\ncannot be a scalp in the opposite direction with the same risk, reward, and probability. For example, the market cannot have a 60 percent chance\nof going up two points before going down two points at the same time that it has a 60 percent chance of going down two points before going up two\npoints. Look at a bull trend. If a bullish trader buys at one tick above a strong signal bar in a reliable pullback in the Emini and his entry price is\n1254, then his two-point stop is 1252 and his profit target is 1256. The bull would only take the trade if he thought that it probably would probably\nwork, which implies that he had to be at least 60 percent certain, which means that the chance that the market would fall to 1252 and that his stop\nwould be hit is be 40 percent or less. If a bear scalper took the other side of the trade and shorted at 1254.00, his stop is at 1256 and his profit\ntarget is 1252. Since the chance of the market falling to 1252 is 40 percent or less, the bear has a 40 percent chance or less of making his profit. In\nfact, it is almost always going to be less, because for his profit taking limit order to get filled, the market usually has to go one tick beyond it, which\nis even less likely because it is a bigger move.\nBecause of the mathematics, the person taking the other side of a scalp has to have a lower probability of success. Since in a very efficient\nmarket, institutions control the price action, every trade that takes place has to be one where one or more institutions are willing to take one side\nand one or more other institutions are willing to take the other (nothing is absolute, but this is pretty close). This means that the person taking the\nother side of a reasonable scalp has to have a reward greater than his risk if he is to have a profitable trader's equation (you have to assume that\nhe does because he is an institution or someone taking a trade that an institution is also willing to take). This makes him a swing trader. Since the\nprobability of swing trades is often 40 percent or less, a swing trader can take the opposite side of a scalper's trade and still have a positive\ntrader's equation. If the probability of the market falling two points is 40 percent, the swing trading bear who is trying for more than two points has to\nhave less than a 40 percent chance of success. However, if he manages his trade correctly, he can still make a consistent profit using this strategy.\nFor example, from the discussion following on scaling into trades, you will see that he could be using a much wider stop than two points, and he\nmight be willing to scale in several times if the market goes higher. If so, his probability of success can be 60 percent or higher. Once the market\nfinally falls, he could exit his entire position at his original entry price of 1254. If he exited his entire position at his original short entry price, he would\nbe out at breakeven on his first entry and have a profit on all of the later shorts that he placed at higher prices.\nTo scalp the 5 minute Emini chart effectively, with the current average daily range between eight and 15 points, you have to risk about two points,\nand your profit target is usually between one and three points. On one-point scalps, you have to win on over 67 percent of your trades just to break\neven. Although this is achievable for some traders, it is unrealistic for the majority of them. As a general rule, take a trade only where the potential\nreward is at least as large as the risk and where you are confident about the trade. If you are confident, one guideline is to assume that you believe\nthat the chance of success is at least 60 percent. In the Emini, a two-point stop is currently (with an average daily range of 10 to 15 points) the most\nreliable stop for most trades based on a 5 minute chart, and that means that your profit target should be at least two points as well.

Incidentally, I had a friend many years ago who used to trade 100 Emini contracts\nat a time, scalping two ticks on about 25 trades a day. Since he lived in a 12,000-square-foot house, I assume that he was doing well. However,\nthis is in the realm of high-frequency trading and virtually impossible for most traders to do profitably. A have another friend who once told me about\na mutual acquaintance who made millions on Wall Street as an attorney and lost almost all of it as a trader. He probably assumed that he was much\nsmarter than all of his clients who were making millions as traders and that he should have been able to do at least as well. He scalped 100 Emini\ncontracts and lost $2 million over the first couple of years. He might have been smart, but he was not wise. Just because something looks easy\ndoes not mean that it actually is easy.\nThe issue of cherry-picking crosses everyone's mind at some point. Instead of worrying about taking 20 trades a day and trying to make one\npoint on each, what about just scalping the very best three trades of the day and trying to make one point on each? In theory it is workable, but the\nreality is that if you have waited so long for the perfect trade and you worked so hard for so long to learn what is necessary to spot such a great\ntrade, you have to make sure that you are adequately rewarded. One point is not enough. For example, if you believe that you are about to buy one\nof the best one or two setups of the day, you should assume that the market will agree that the setup is strong. That means that the always-in\nposition will probably become clearly always-in long, that there will likely be at least two legs up to some kind of measured move or magnet area,\nand that the move should last at least 10 bars. Instead of scalping out for one point while risking two points, it makes much more sense to exit after\na minimum of two points and maybe even four points. If you cannot handle this emotionally and you find yourself exiting at breakeven on the first\npullback, you might try putting in a one cancels the other (OCO) bracket order as soon as you get long in which you have a two-point protective stop\nand a two-point profit-taking limit order. As soon as one gets filled, the other gets canceled automatically. Then go for a walk and come back in\nabout an hour. After you've done this a few times, you might try using a three- or four-point profit target instead of two points and you might soon\ndiscover that you are averaging four points’ profit per day on these trades.\nSome scalpers scalp all of their trades, but many traders will scalp or swing, depending on circumstances. Implicit in the concept of scalping for\nthis second group of scalpers is that they are not trading in the direction of a clear always-in situation. If they are scalping, they must believe either\nthat there is no clear trend or that their trade is countertrend; otherwise they would be swinging. Even if the market has been trending and traders\nenter on a pullback, if they scalp, they believe that the trend is about to end, at least for a while. For example, if they buy a bull flag but exit with only a\nscalp, they suspect that the market is about to enter a trading range. If they believed otherwise, they would hold their position for a larger profit.\nWhenever a trader sees the market pull back three or four ticks after a signal, it is a sign that big traders believe that the market is not likely to go\nfar. Because of this, the trader will consider only trading range trades or countertrend trades, rather than trend trades. Since this means that the\nmarket is probably in a trading range, experienced traders will tend to scalp rather than swing, and look to buy low, sell high.\nWhen traders are trading countertrend, they will sometimes trade a smaller position, like half size, because they are willing to add on if the\nmarket goes against them. If they do, they might get out once the market gets back to their first entry price. They would then have a breakeven trade\non the first entry and a scalper's profit on the second. Whenever traders scalp, their profit target is often about half of the size of the minimum target\nfor a swing, but the risk is usually the same. This means that their reward is about the same size as their risk, and they therefore need to have at\nleast a 70 percent chance of success or else this approach is a losing strategy. Scaling in can help increase the odds, but the trade-off is more risk\nbecause your position size is larger. As easy and tempting as scalping appears to be, it is a very difficult approach to trade profitably.\nIf you swing part of your trade using a breakeven stop after taking partial profits at a couple of points, this reduces the required winning\npercentage. If you move your stop from the signal bar extreme to the entry bar extreme (one tick beyond both) after the entry bar closes, and then to\nbreakeven after a five-tick move, this further reduces the required winning percentage to be profitable on the day. Finally, some scalpers use a\nwider stop of three to five points and add on as the market moves against them, and then use a wider profit target, and this again further reduces\nthe required winning percentage. In general, if you see a setup that you feel is a very high-probability trade, the trade will likely be a scalp instead of\na large swing. This is because whenever there is such an obvious imbalance, the market will correct it quickly, so a very high-probability, relatively\nlow-risk situation cannot last more than a bar or two.\nSwing traders use the same setups and stops as the scalpers, but focus on the few trades each day that are likely to have at least a two-legged\nmove. They can usually net four or more points on part of their position on each trade and then move their stop to breakeven on the balance. Many\nwill let the trade go against them and add on at a better price. However, they always have at least a mental stop and, if the market gets to that point,\nthey conclude that their idea can no longer be valid and they will exit with a loss. Always look for where scalpers will have their stops, and look to\nadd on to your position at that location, if the pattern is still valid. If you bought what you perceived to be a reversal, consider allowing the market to\nput in a lower low and then add on at the second entry. For example, with a reliable stock like Apple (AAPL), if you are buying what you perceive to\nbe near the low of the move and the overall market is not in a bear trend day, consider risking two to three dollars on the trade and adding on at a\none- to two-dollar open loss. However, only experienced traders who are very comfortable in their ability to read price charts and in their ability to\naccept a large loss if their read is wrong should attempt this. On most days, the market should go your way immediately, so this is not an issue.\nSwing traders can take a position and keep adding the same size position with each subsequent signal, after they have a reasonable profit. The\nstop on the entire position is the stop of the most recent addition, which usually means that they will have a profit on their earlier entries, even if they\nlose on their final entry. They would also exit before their trailing stop was hit if the market generated a signal in the opposite direction.\nEveryone wants a very high winning percentage, but very few people ever develop the ability to consistently win on 70 percent or more of their\ntrades. This is why so few traders can make a living scalping for one or two points in the Emini, although just about everyone tries it for a while when\nstarting out. For most traders to be successful, they have to learn to accept a lower winning percentage and develop the patience to swing trade,\nallowing pullbacks along the way. Even if traders are very successful scalpers, unless they are also willing to swing trade occasionally, they will\nusually not participate in some protracted trends where the probability of a successful trade is often 60 percent or less. Many very good traders sit\nquietly during these times and simply wait for a high-probability scalp, missing a good part of what is often a protracted move. This is an\nacceptable way to trade, because the goal of trading is to make money, not to be constantly placing trades.\nWhen the Emini has an average daily range of 10 to 15 points, there will usually be at least one trade a day where a trader can enter on a stop\nand exit on a limit order with a four-point profit. Since 99 percent of the days have at least a five-point range, theoretically a trader could enter and\nexit on limit orders and make four points, but that is impossible for anyone to do consistently on small range days. In general, it is easier for traders\nto spot setups where they can enter on stops and exit on either limit orders or trailing stops. There is at least one four-point swing on 90 percent of\nthe days, and about five four-point swings occur in about 10 percent of the days. Most days have one to three swings where a trader can make four\npoints from a stop entry. If a trader is making 10 to 15 trades a day, then most of the trades are scalps. However, strong scalpers will know when a\nsetup has a reasonable chance of becoming a swing of four to 10 points and will usually swing a quarter to a half of their positions in those\nsituations. Once they exit the scalp portion, if there are additional entries as the market continues in their swing direction, they will usually put scalps\nback on when additional setups develop.\n", "text_clean": "think that two points is a realistic target, then don't take the trade. Incidentally, I had a friend many years ago who used to trade 100 Emini contracts at a time, scalping two ticks on about 25 trades a day. Since he lived in a 12,000-square-foot house, I assume that he was doing well. However, this is in the realm of high-frequency trading and virtually impossible for most traders to do profitably. A have another friend who once told me about a mutual acquaintance who made millions on Wall Street as an attorney and lost almost all of it as a trader. He probably assumed that he was much smarter than all of his clients who were making millions as traders and that he should have been able to do at least as well. He scalped 100 Emini contracts and lost $2 million over the first couple of years. He might have been smart, but he was not wise. Just because something looks easy does not mean that it actually is easy.\nThe issue of cherry-picking crosses everyone's mind at some point.

Swing setups tend to be either unclear,\nor clear but scary. Most swing setups have a 40 to 50 percent chance of leading to a swing that will reach the trader's profit target. In the other 50 to\n60 percent of trades, either traders will exit before the target is reached if they believe that the target is no longer reasonable, or their protective\nstop will be hit. Most swing traders enter on reversals, because they need to get into the trade early if they hope to make four or more points. When\na trend is especially strong, they can often make four points by entering on a pullback or even on the close of a bar in a strong spike, but these\nsituations arise only a couple of times a week. Most swing traders try to buy some kind of double bottom, short some kind of double top, or enter on\nsome other reliable opening reversal setup in the first couple of hours of the day. They often have to enter on several reversals before one turns into\na big swing, but they still usually make money, on balance, on the trades that do not reach a four-point target. Those trades end up as scalps. For\nexample, if a trader bought a double bottom in the first hour, and then after six bars the market set up a reasonable double top, the trader might\nreverse to short, maybe making a point or two on the long. Just as a scalper sometimes swings, most swing traders end up with lots of scalps.\nOnce swing traders believe that their premise is no longer valid, they exit, often with a scalp.\nAfter swing traders see a reasonable setup, they have to take the trade. Swing setups almost always appear less certain than scalp setups, and\nthis lower probability tends to make traders wait. When there is a strong signal bar, it usually comes as part of a very emotional reversal, and a\nbeginning trader is still thinking that the old trend remains in effect. Beginning traders are typically unprepared for this. They might be thinking that\nthe old trend is still in effect, and they might have lost on several earlier countertrend trades today and don't want to lose any more money. Their\ndenial causes them to miss the early entry. Entering on the breakout or after the breakout bar closes is hard to do, because the breakout spike is\noften large, and traders have to quickly decide to risk much more than they usually do. This is why they often end up choosing to wait for a pullback.\nEven if they reduce their position size so that the dollar risk is the same as with any other trade, the thought of risking two or three times as many\nticks frightens them. Entering on a pullback is difficult because every pullback begins with a minor reversal, and they are afraid that the pullback\nmight be the start of a deep correction. They end up waiting until the day is almost over and then finally decide that the trend is clear, but now there\nis no more time left to place a trade. Trends do everything they can to keep traders out, and that is the only way they can keep traders chasing the\nmarket all day. When a setup is easy and clear, the move is usually a small, fast scalp. If the move is going to go a long way, it has to be unclear\nand difficult to take, to keep traders on the sidelines and force them to chase the trend.\nSwing traders should always be wondering if they should exit the trade early, before their profit target is reached. One way to help decide is to\nimagine that you are flat and think about whether you should enter at the market with a swing-size position and a protective stop exactly where a\nswing trader who is in the market would have his stop. If you would not take that trade, then you should exit your swing position immediately. This is\nbecause holding your current swing trade is identical financially to initiating a new trade of the identical size at that price and with that stop.\nMost swing traders will scalp out if the trade is not unfolding as desired, and most scalpers will swing part of their position when they are entering\non the best setups, so there is a lot of overlap in what both do. The fundamental difference is that the scalper will take far more trades, and most of\nthose trades are not likely to yield more than a scalper's profit, whereas a swing trader tries to only take the trades that are likely to have at least two\nlegs. Neither way is superior to the other, and traders choose the method that best suits their personalities.\nAs discussed in the section on the trader's equation in Chapter 25, swing trades are usually less certain than scalp trades. This means that the\nprobability of success is less. However, a trader who is swinging is looking for a large profit, and the profit is usually at least twice as large as the\nrisk. This larger potential profit compensates for the lower probability of success and can lead to a favorable trader's equation. The biggest swings\ncome from breakouts of trading ranges and from reversals, and most reversal patterns are trading ranges. This is where uncertainty is highest, and\nthe probability of success is often 50 percent or less. A swing trader needs to look for a setup where the reward is sufficiently larger than the risk, to\ncompensate for the lower probability of success. Scalps are much more certain, but a high degree of certainty means a conspicuously large\nimbalance in the market, and a large imbalance is quickly noticed and neutralized by traders. The result is that the market quickly returns to a state\nof confusion (a trading range). Scalpers have to be fast in deciding to take the trade and in taking profits, because the move will usually come back\nto the entry price within a few bars.\nSwings last a long time because of uncertainty, which is usually a critical component of any trade that lasts for many bars and covers many\npoints. This is the wall of worry that is often mentioned in a strong bull trend, and it works in an opposite form in a strong bear trend. The difficulties\nof trend trading are discussed in the first book. Trends begin as small or large spikes, and then evolve into small or large channels. When the\nbreakout is small, traders are uncertain if there will be follow-through. When it is big and strong, the uncertainty takes a different form. Traders are\nunsure of how much they have to risk to stay in the trade, and if the trader's equation is favorable because of the large risk. They see the large spike\nand realize that they might have to risk to the opposite side of the spike. This increased risk results in a much smaller position size. They then\nchase the market as it enters a channel, because their initial position was smaller than they wanted it to be. The channel then has the uncertainty of\nbeing a two-sided market. At the end of the day, beginners will look at the chart and see a strong trend, and wonder how they missed it. The reason\nis that all big moves are uncertain as they are unfolding, and this traps traders out of the strongest trends. It also often traps traders into\ncountertrend trades, resulting in repeated losses. Even a beginner has a sense of probabilities and senses that the trend is a low-probability event,\nwhich it is. The strongest trends happen only a few times a month, so beginners know that the odds of today growing into one of those strong trend\ndays are small. They end up either denying it and getting trapped out or fighting it and taking repeated losses. Instead, they need to learn to accept\nit and follow what the market is doing. If it is relentlessly going up, even though it looks weak, they need to buy at least a small position, and swing it.\nTrade management for swing trading is identical to that for always-in trading, which is discussed in the third book, except that swing traders tend\nto scale out as the trade goes their way. A truly always-in trader holds on to the position until there is an opposite signal, and then reverses to a\ntrade in the opposite direction. For most traders, swing trading entries and stops are identical to those in trend trading, which was discussed in\nbook 1. One important difference is that most swing traders treat exits in a trading range differently from those in a trend. In a trend, they are more\nlikely to let part of their positions run until there is an opposite signal, but in a trading range, they are much more likely to exit the remainder of their\npositions near the extreme of the trading range. At that point, they decide whether the move was weak enough and the reversal pattern strong\nenough so that they should look for an opposite swing, or instead the swing was strong enough so that they should wait for a pullback and reenter\nfor a second leg in their original direction.\nWhen the average daily range in the Emini is 10 to 15 points and a trader can usually use a two-point protective stop without getting stopped out\nof most good trades, many swing traders will take partial profits at two to four points, depending on the situation. If traders think that the market is in\na trading range and they are buying a reversal up at the bottom, the probability of an equidistant move is usually 60 percent or more. Since they are\nrisking two points, they then have a 60 percent chance of making two points before the stop is hit. This results in a minimally acceptable trader's\nequation, and therefore a trader can take partial profits at two points. If traders believe that the trading range is tall enough for them to make three\nor four points, they might take partial or full profits at that level. Other traders will take partial profits on longs at resistance levels, like minor\nreversals at measured move targets, above prior swing highs, and on bear trend line and bull trend channel line overshoots and reversals (failed\n", "text_clean": "Swing trading is much more difficult than it appears when a trader looks at a chart at the end of the day. Swing setups tend to be either unclear, or clear but scary. Most swing setups have a 40 to 50 percent chance of leading to a swing that will reach the trader's profit target. In the other 50 to 60 percent of trades, either traders will exit before the target is reached if they believe that the target is no longer reasonable, or their protective stop will be hit.

They end up waiting until the day is almost over and then finally decide that the trend is clear, but now there is no more time left to place a trade. Trends do everything they can to keep traders out, and that is the only way they can keep traders chasing the market all day. When a setup is easy and clear, the move is usually a small, fast scalp. If the move is going to go a long way, it has to be unclear and difficult to take, to keep traders on the sidelines and force them to chase the trend.\nSwing traders should always be wondering if they should exit the trade early, before their profit target is reached. One way to help decide is to imagine that you are flat and think about whether you should enter at the market with a swing-size position and a protective stop exactly where a swing trader who is in the market would have his stop. If you would not take that trade, then you should exit your swing position immediately. This is because holding your current swing trade is identical financially to initiating a new trade of the identical size at that price and with that stop.\nMost swing traders will scalp out if the trade is not unfolding as desired, and most scalpers will swing part of their position when they are entering on the best setups, so there is a lot of overlap in what both do. The fundamental difference is that the scalper will take far more trades, and most of those trades are not likely to yield more than a scalper's profit, whereas a swing trader tries to only take the trades that are likely to have at least two legs. Neither way is superior to the other, and traders choose the method that best suits their personalities.\nAs discussed in the section on the trader's equation in Chapter 25, swing trades are usually less certain than scalp trades. This means that the probability of success is less. However, a trader who is swinging is looking for a large profit, and the profit is usually at least twice as large as the risk. This larger potential profit compensates for the lower probability of success and can lead to a favorable trader's equation. The biggest swings come from breakouts of trading ranges and from reversals, and most reversal patterns are trading ranges. This is where uncertainty is highest, and the probability of success is often 50 percent or less. A swing trader needs to look for a setup where the reward is sufficiently larger than the risk, to compensate for the lower probability of success. Scalps are much more certain, but a high degree of certainty means a conspicuously large imbalance in the market, and a large imbalance is quickly noticed and neutralized by traders. The result is that the market quickly returns to a state of confusion (a trading range). Scalpers have to be fast in deciding to take the trade and in taking profits, because the move will usually come back to the entry price within a few bars.\nSwings last a long time because of uncertainty, which is usually a critical component of any trade that lasts for many bars and covers many points. This is the wall of worry that is often mentioned in a strong bull trend, and it works in an opposite form in a strong bear trend. The difficulties of trend trading are discussed in the first book. Trends begin as small or large spikes, and then evolve into small or large channels. When the breakout is small, traders are uncertain if there will be follow-through. When it is big and strong, the uncertainty takes a different form. Traders are unsure of how much they have to risk to stay in the trade, and if the trader's equation is favorable because of the large risk. They see the large spike and realize that they might have to risk to the opposite side of the spike. This increased risk results in a much smaller position size. They then chase the market as it enters a channel, because their initial position was smaller than they wanted it to be. The channel then has the uncertainty of being a two-sided market. At the end of the day, beginners will look at the chart and see a strong trend, and wonder how they missed it. The reason is that all big moves are uncertain as they are unfolding, and this traps traders out of the strongest trends. It also often traps traders into countertrend trades, resulting in repeated losses. Even a beginner has a sense of probabilities and senses that the trend is a low-probability event, which it is. The strongest trends happen only a few times a month, so beginners know that the odds of today growing into one of those strong trend days are small. They end up either denying it and getting trapped out or fighting it and taking repeated losses. Instead, they need to learn to accept it and follow what the market is doing. If it is relentlessly going up, even though it looks weak, they need to buy at least a small position, and swing it.\nTrade management for swing trading is identical to that for always-in trading, which is discussed in the third book, except that swing traders tend to scale out as the trade goes their way. A truly always-in trader holds on to the position until there is an opposite signal, and then reverses to a trade in the opposite direction. For most traders, swing trading entries and stops are identical to those in trend trading, which was discussed in book 1. One important difference is that most swing traders treat exits in a trading range differently from those in a trend. In a trend, they are more likely to let part of their positions run until there is an opposite signal, but in a trading range, they are much more likely to exit the remainder of their positions near the extreme of the trading range. At that point, they decide whether the move was weak enough and the reversal pattern strong enough so that they should look for an opposite swing, or instead the swing was strong enough so that they should wait for a pullback and reenter for a second leg in their original direction.\nWhen the average daily range in the Emini is 10 to 15 points and a trader can usually use a two-point protective stop without getting stopped out of most good trades, many swing traders will take partial profits at two to four points, depending on the situation. If traders think that the market is in a trading range and they are buying a reversal up at the bottom, the probability of an equidistant move is usually 60 percent or more. Since they are risking two points, they then have a 60 percent chance of making two points before the stop is hit. This results in a minimally acceptable trader's equation, and therefore a trader can take partial profits at two points. If traders believe that the trading range is tall enough for them to make three or four points, they might take partial or full profits at that level. Other traders will take partial profits on longs at resistance levels, like minor reversals at measured move targets, above prior swing highs, and on bear trend line and bull trend channel line overshoots and reversals (failed", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["Swing trading is much more difficult than it appears when a trader looks at a chart at the end of the day.

They will take partial profits on shorts at comparable support levels. All traders exit their final positions whenever there is a strong\nreversal signal. Remember, they will exit partially or fully on a weak reversal signal, but not usually reverse. This is because traders use different\ncriteria for exiting than for entering a trade. They require a stronger signal before they enter, but will take partial or full profits on a weaker signal in\nthe direction opposite to their position. There are many ways to profitably trade swing trades, and the only major issue is the trader's equation. As\nlong as the math makes sense, then the approach is profitable and therefore reasonable.\nIt is reasonable for an experienced trader to be primarily a scalper when trading Eminis, looking for two to four points (when the average daily\nrange is about 10 to 15 points), and a swing trader when trading stocks. If you are one of those extremely rare traders who can win on 80 percent or\nmore of your trades, then you can scalp some Emini trades for a one-point profit. Exit part or all of your trade on a limit order after four ticks of profit,\nwhich usually requires the move to extend six ticks beyond the signal bar (the entry is on a stop at one tick beyond the signal bar; then you need four\nmore ticks for your profit, and your limit exit order usually is not filled until the price moves one tick beyond your target). Four ticks in the Emini is one\npoint, which is equivalent to a 10 cent (10-tick) move in the SPY (ETF contract).\nSo what should a beginner do? Most traders will lose money if they scalp for a profit target that is smaller than their risk, even if they win on 60\npercent of their trades. Beginners will often be wrong about what they think is a 60 percent setup. Many of their trades will actually be only 50\npercent certain at best, although they seemed much more certain at the time that the beginning traders took them. They will probably think that they\njust need a little more experience to increase their winning percentage up to 70 or 80 percent, where they know that math would then be on their\nside. The reality is that they will never become that good, because very few of the best traders ever get there. That is the simple truth.\nAt the other extreme is swing trading for a profit that is at least twice as large as his risk. Most of these setups are only 40 to 50 percent certain,\nbut that is enough to have a favorable trader's equation. On most days, there are a couple of setups a day, and sometimes five or more, and most\nare usually major trend reversals (discussed in book 3). If a trader is willing to take low probability trades (the reward has to be at least twice as big\nas the risk, as discussed in Chapter 25), he needs to take every reasonable setup because the math is against him if he cherry picks. The trader's\nequation for these trades is positive for a basket of them, but the odds are that any one trade will lose since the probability is less than 50 percent.\nThe probability is low because the setup looks bad, and the trade often looks weak even after the entry and usually has several pullbacks before a\nstrong trend finally begins. Many traders instead prefer to wait for the trend to begin so that the probability will be 60 percent or higher, although\nthere is less profit remaining in the trade. Many swing setups are strong, with probabilities of 60 percent or greater. When that is the case, each\ntrade has a positive trader's equation and cherry picking is mathematically acceptable. Also, the math is good for either a swing or a scalp. Most\ntraders starting out will experiment with both swing trading and scalping and just about everything else, like different time frames and indicators, to\nsee if they can be successful and if a particular style better suits their personalities. There is no one best way, and any approach where there is a\npositive trader's equation is good. Many traders try to catch five to 10 tradable swings a day where the probability of making a profit that is at least\nas large as the risk is 60 percent or greater. When they do, they usually look for micro double tops to short and micro double bottoms to buy. If a\ntrader thinks that a setup is strong and will likely yield a reward that is at least as large as his risk, then it has a probability of success of at least 60\npercent (Chapter 25 discusses the mathematics of the directional probability of an equidistant move). This allows the trader to have a stop that is\nthe same size as his profit target and still have a favorable trader's equation. Although this is the style that most successful traders adopt, most\nbeginners should instead first look for strong swing trade setups, even though the chance of success is often only 50 to 60 percent. This is because\nwhen the reward is two or more times the size of the risk, the trader's equation is even stronger, despite the smaller probability of success. In the\nEmini, when the average daily range is about 10 to 15 points, look for trades with a good chance of a four-point (twice the size of the initial risk) or\nmore swing, and exit some or all at four points. With experience, a trader can scalp out part for two to four points and then swing the balance. If he\nfocuses on these setups, he is giving himself a reasonable chance to become a profitable trader. If a trader finds that he often exits too soon, he\nshould consider placing his OCO orders (one to take profit at two to four points, the other to get stopped out with a loss of two points or less), walk\naway, and come back in an hour. He might be surprised that he has suddenly become a successful trader. Once the trend is established, look for\nadditional entries in the direction of the trend, scalping most for two points while risking about two points and, if the trend is very strong, swinging\nsome. As simple as this sounds, trading is never easy because you are competing against very smart people in a zero sum game, and what looks\nso obvious at the end of the day is usually not very obvious at all in real time. It takes a long time to learn to trade profitably and even once you do,\nyou have to stay sharp and maintain your discipline every day. It is challenging, but that is part of the appeal. If you become successful, the financial\nrewards can be huge.\nWhen it comes to stocks, there is much more variability in the size of the profit targets. For a $500 stock with an average daily range of $10, it\nwould be foolish to scalp for 10 cents, because you would likely have to risk about two dollars, and your winning percentage would have to be over\n95 percent. However, scalping for 10 cents might be worthwhile in QQQ especially if you are trading 10,000 shares.\nIt is relatively easy to look for swings in high-volume stocks (at least three million shares per day, but preferably seven million or more) that have\nan average range of several dollars. You want minimal slippage, reliable patterns, and at least $1.00 profit per trade. Try to scalp for $1.00 and then\nuse a breakeven stop on the balance; hold until the close or until a clear and strong opposite setup develops. You might be able to watch about five\nstocks regularly throughout the day and sometimes check on up to another five or so at different times during the day, but you will rarely ever trade\nthem.\nAn Emini scalper will likely be able to enter only a couple of stock trades a day, since Emini day trading takes so much attention. Also, if you only\nuse bar charts for stocks, this allows you to put six charts on one screen. Just pick the one stock that is trending the best and then look for a\npullback near the moving average. You can also trade reversals if you see a trend channel overshoot and reversal after there was a prior strong\ntrend line break. If the Emini market is active, consider trading only 15 minute stock charts, which require less attention.\nWhen you are anticipating a significant move or a new trend, or when you are entering on a pullback in a strong trend, exit 25 to 75 percent of\nyour contracts at a scalper's profit that is equal to at least one to two times your initial risk, and then scale out of the remaining contracts as the\nmarket continues to go your way. Move your protective stop to around breakeven after you exit the scalp portion of your trade. Sometimes you will\nwant to risk as many as four to six ticks in the Eminis if you feel strongly that the trade will remain good, and an exit and then a reentry approach\nwould be at a worse price. A good trade should not come back to let latecomers in at the same price as the smart traders who got in at the perfect\ntime. If the trade is great, all of the traders who missed the initial entry are now so eager to get in that they will be willing to enter at a worse price\nand will place limit entry orders at a tick or two worse than the original entry, keeping the breakeven stop of the original traders from being hit.\nHowever, sometimes the best trades come back to beyond the breakeven stop to trap traders out of what will become a huge, fast trend. When that\nseems like a possibility, risk a few extra ticks. Also, if it comes back and runs those stops and then immediately resumes the new trend, reenter or\nadd to your swing position at one tick beyond the prior bar (in a new bull trend, this is one tick above the prior bar's high).\nIf the market touches the profit target limit order but does not go through it and the order is still filled, that means that there might be more trend\npressure than is evident on the chart, and the chances increase that the market will go beyond the profit target within the next several bars.

The market fell almost 2 percent yesterday, but\nhad been in a strong bull trend for months. The sell-off was just a poke below the daily moving average and was a pullback test the bottom of a bull\nchannel in a 60 minute spike and channel bull trend. This meant that traders saw this as an area of support and thought that the sharp sell-off\nyesterday might have been just a sell vacuum and not the start of a bear trend. Both bars 3 and 5 were strong bull trend bars, and both followed\nattempts to test yesterday's low. The first bar of the day had a big tail on the top, which meant that it sold off into the close of the bar. However,\ninstead of finding enough bears to drive the market below yesterday's strong bear close, the bulls were so strong that they did not allow the low 1\nshort to trigger. The bar 4 low 2 (some saw it as a low 1) triggered, but was strongly reversed up by bar 5. Traders thought that this was a possible\nlow of the day and bought above bar 5 on a stop for a swing up. The double top at bar 7 never triggered, because it was a two-bar reversal and the\ntrigger was below the lower of the two bars (the bull bar before bar 7), and not just below the bear bar. Some bulls took partial profits here (two to\nthree points, depending on where they bought) as bars 6 and 7 were forming, and that long liquidation created the tails at the tops of the bars. The\ndouble top was followed by the bar 8 bull trend bar, setting up a high 2 buy signal above the moving average in a bull swing, which is a reliable buy\nsetup. Some bulls took partial profits at two, three, or four points up from this entry, and others took full profits at three or four points. Many did not\nexit until the market gave a sell signal at the bar 10 two-bar reversal. As with many swing trades, the sell setup was not ideal because the\nmomentum up from bar 8 was strong. This reduced the probability that a swing short would have been successful. However, if this was a trading\nrange day, a bear had at least a 50 percent chance of the market testing the middle of the day's range, which was about five points below the entry\nprice. With about a two-point risk, this yielded a good trader's equation.\nThis was the second leg up after a strong bear day and therefore a possible high of the day. Some bears shorted here, but other traders\nwondered if there might be another attempt up after such a strong rally. Once the market broke strongly to the downside in the bear bar before bar\n11, traders gave up on the notion that the market might be forming a bull flag pullback to the moving average. Many traders shorted on this large\nbear bar, which is why it was a big bear breakout bar. Others shorted on the close of bar 11. Since it did not have a bull close, it confirmed the bear\nbreakout. Still others chased the market down and shorted on the bear bars that followed. Since traders knew that the market might form a double\nbottom near yesterday's low, this sell-off could have been a sell vacuum instead of a bear trend. This made many traders hesitant to short near the\nsupport of the low of today and yesterday.\nBar 12 was a strong bull reversal bar with a low just above the low of yesterday, and therefore a signal bar for a double bottom long. It also\nfollowed the largest bear body of the day, which was an exhaustive sell climax and sell vacuum, and not the start of a bear trend. Smart bears took\nprofits here, but many took partial profits at two, three, or four points from their entry prices, anticipating the double bottom and expecting the day to\nbecome a trading range day. Their expectation was based on their correct assumption that 80 percent of breakout attempts up and down fail, no\nmatter how strong the spikes appear. Strong bulls also bought the sell vacuum, initiating new longs. Remember how strong the bulls appeared to\nbe in the rally to bar 10, only for the move to be seen later as just a buy vacuum and not a new bull trend.\nThere was a second entry long after the failed bar 13 low 1 short at the bottom of the developing trading range, and then a bull reversal bar higher\nlow at bar 14. Many bulls went long again here for a swing up. The spike up to bar 15 was strong, so traders expected another rally attempt after a\npullback, and most would have considered this premise to remain valid as long as the market held above the bottom of the bull spike. Some\ntraders put their protective stops below bar 14, while others used the bar 12 low. If they bought near the top of the spike, their risk was large and\ntherefore their position size had to be small. Beginning traders would have had a hard time buying above either bar 12 or bar 14 because the sell-\noff was so steep. However, the day appeared to be a trading range day. Therefore, experienced traders were willing to buy a setup that might have\nonly about a 40 to 50 percent chance of success, like the one at bar 12, which they believed had the potential to make about five points while\nrisking about two. Bar 14 probably had a 60 percent chance of success, but the reward at that point was now a little less. Both setups had favorable\ntrader's equations, even though beginners would have had a difficult time taking them.\nAggressive bears shorted below the bar 18 two-bar reversal, which was a double top and a lower high on the day. Other traders were instead\nwaiting to buy a pullback.\nBar 19 appeared to be a high 2 buy entry, but since the bar before it was not a good buy signal bar, most traders would not have bought as bar\n19 went outside up. Most would have waited for a pullback before buying. Some would have bought above bar 19 because it had a strong bull\nbody, and the breakout above its high would have been a sign of confirmation of its bull breakout above the bar before it. Instead of a breakout\npullback, the market broke to the downside.\nBar 21 was a strong bull reversal bar and a high 3 buy setup. However, since the market was still in the bear channel from bar 18, many bulls\npreferred to wait for a second entry, which came with the high 4 two-bar reversal at bar 23. Some bought the high 4 and others bought above the\nbull bar that followed bar 23. They saw this as a bull flag following the spike from bar 12 to bar 16, and they expected a second leg up, maybe to a\nleg 1 = leg 2 measured move up. Some traders who bought above bar 21 were aware that the market might form a lower low pullback from the\nbreakout above the top of the bar, and this is what happened. Because of this possibility, many traded a smaller position size and used a wide\nprotective stop, like maybe below bar 14 or bar 12, or maybe three to five points. Those traders then put on the remainder of their longs on the\nsecond entry above the bar 23 two-bar reversal. Some longs took partial profits at fixed intervals, like two, three, or four points, while others waited\nfor price action profit targets, like below the bar 26 second leg up or below the bar 28 wedge rally (bars 24, 26, and 28 were the three pushes up).\nAggressive bears shorted below bar 28 or below the bear bar that followed it, looking for a test of the bar 25 bull channel that followed the spike\nup from bar 23. They took profits at two, three, and four points, or just above, at, or below the bar 25 bull channel low, or just before the close of the\nday.\n", "text_clean": "Today (as shown in Figure 24.2) offered many opportunities for swing traders in both directions.

Will I Make Money If I Take\nThis Trade?\nI havea friend who has traded for over 30 years, and I think that he makes 10 or more points in the Eminis pretty much every day. He once told me\nthat he believed that the average beginner should be able to make at least six points a day. I told him that I disagreed—that most beginners would\nbe happy to consistently make two points a day. I left the conversation realizing that there are traders who have been wildly successful for so long\nthat they have completely forgotten what it was like to be in the losing camp. However, the conversation also made me realize that, with enough\nexperience, traders’ good habits can become so much a part of who they are that trading becomes essentially effortless. But in every case,\nmathematics still has to be the basis of what they are doing. In fact, trading is entirely about math, and all successful traders understand\nprobabilities and the trader's equation extremely well. The math changes with every tick, which is a barrier to those who don't understand what is\ngoing on and a great advantage to those who do.\nBeginning traders are constantly looking for the perfect trade, one with a clear setup, high probability of success, low risk, and a large reward. At\nthe end of the day, they wonder why they couldn't find one. Surely those trades exist, because how else are the big traders getting rich? What they\ndon't realize is that making money is very difficult, because the market is filled with smart people who are trying to take money from each other. This\nprevents anyone from ever having a huge advantage. As soon as a perfect setup begins to form, everyone trades it and it quickly disappears,\nbecause there is no one willing to take the opposite side. The traders who missed the perfect setup don't want to chase it, and will enter only on a\npullback. Once the market begins to pull back after not going very far, all of the traders who entered on what they thought was perfection are now\nholding losing trades. They quickly dump their positions and the perfect trade now goes in the opposite direction.\nTo make money as a trader, you need an edge, which means a mathematical advantage based on the size of your risk and reward, and on the\nprobability of your profit target being reached before your protective stop is hit. Edges are rarely large, so whenever one of the three variables is\nunusually good, it will be offset by one or both of the other variables being bad. For example, if the potential reward is much larger than the risk,\nmeaning that the risk is relatively small, the probability is usually small. If the probability is high, the reward is small and the risk is often high. The\nedge that traditional firms have is that they trade enough volume to have a vote on the direction of the market, and they have many trading systems\nrunning simultaneously and many traders trading independently, which smooths out their equity curve. Their goal is a small reward, usually 10\npercent to 20 percent profit per year, with a relatively small risk and a high probability of success (they expect to make money by the end of the year\nmore than 70 percent of the time). The edge of the high-frequency trading (HFT) firms is that they have a highly reliable statistical advantage, which\nis probably only 5 percent or less (a chance of winning of less than 55 percent is about a 5 percent advantage over a 50–50 pure luck system), but\nthey apply it millions of times each week. This gives them a casino advantage. If a casino has only one customer, and he bets a billion dollars on a\nsingle bet, the casino has a 47 percent chance of going out of business on that bet. However, with a huge number of bets of ordinary sizes, the\nmath greatly favors that their edge will result in a consistent profit. The same is true for a HFT firm. Since many are trying to make just a tick or two\non each trade, their reward is tiny and their risk is relatively large on each trade, but the reliability of their success is high. Most of them probably\nhave a 90 percent chance or better of making a profit every day, which means that their probability of success is high. The edge that day traders\ncan have is an exceptional ability to read charts, resulting in a high winning percentage, which can be 70 percent or more. When combined with a\nprofit target that is at least as large as the risk, they can make a very high return on their equity. Most of the very best traders in the world are\ndiscretionary traders, using subjective evaluations to make their decisions. Why would a superstar continue to work at Goldman Sachs, sharing his\nrewards, when he can go out on his own and open a hedge fund or trade for himself? Very few would, and that is why the world's greatest traders\ngo out on their own, and it is also the great lure for all of us. There are countless examples on Wall Street of well-known traders earning billions of\ndollars a year from discretionary trading. Some hold positions for months or years at a time, like Warren Buffett, whereas others are day traders,\nlike Paul Rotter, the “Eurex flipper.” Day traders have many options in the trade-offs among risk, reward, and probability, and some are willing to\naccept a lower probability of success, say 40 percent, in exchange for a reward that is three or more times the risk.\nHere are some examples of situations where a trader has an edge:\nProbability of success of 70 percent or better (reward has to be at least half as big as risk just to break even):\nScalps, but since most traders cannot consistently pick trades with a 70 percent chance of success, they should trade a scalp only if the\nreward is at least as large as the risk. For example, if you believe that a two-point stop is needed in the Emini, take the trade only if at\nleast a two-point reward is reasonable.\nProbability of success of 60 percent or better (reward has to be at least as big as risk to break even):\nBuying a high 2 pullback to the moving average in a bull trend.\nSelling a low 2 pullback to the moving average in a bear trend.\nBuying a wedge bull flag pullback in a bull trend.\nSelling a wedge bear flag pullback in a bear trend.\nBuying a breakout pullback from a breakout of a bull flag in a bull trend.\nSelling a breakout pullback from a breakout of a bear flag in a bear trend.\nBuying a high 1 pullback in a strong bull spike in a bull trend, but not after a buy climax.\nSelling a low 1 pullback in a strong bear spike in a bear trend, but not after a sell climax.\nShorting at the top of a trading range, especially if it is a second entry.\nBuying at the bottom of a trading range, especially if it is a second entry.\nTrend reversals:\nAfter a strong break of the trend line, look for a reversal after a test of the trend's extreme where there is a good reversal\nsignal bar.

Will I Make Money If I Take This Trade?\nI havea friend who has traded for over 30 years, and I think that he makes 10 or more points in the Eminis pretty much every day. He once told me that he believed that the average beginner should be able to make at least six points a day. I told him that I disagreed—that most beginners would be happy to consistently make two points a day. I left the conversation realizing that there are traders who have been wildly successful for so long that they have completely forgotten what it was like to be in the losing camp. However, the conversation also made me realize that, with enough experience, traders’ good habits can become so much a part of who they are that trading becomes essentially effortless. But in every case, mathematics still has to be the basis of what they are doing. In fact, trading is entirely about math, and all successful traders understand probabilities and the trader's equation extremely well. The math changes with every tick, which is a barrier to those who don't understand what is going on and a great advantage to those who do.\nBeginning traders are constantly looking for the perfect trade, one with a clear setup, high probability of success, low risk, and a large reward. At the end of the day, they wonder why they couldn't find one. Surely those trades exist, because how else are the big traders getting rich? What they don't realize is that making money is very difficult, because the market is filled with smart people who are trying to take money from each other. This prevents anyone from ever having a huge advantage. As soon as a perfect setup begins to form, everyone trades it and it quickly disappears, because there is no one willing to take the opposite side. The traders who missed the perfect setup don't want to chase it, and will enter only on a pullback.

The difficulty in solving the equation is assigning a value to the probability, which can never be known with certainty. In general, if you are\nuncertain, assume that you have a 50 percent of winning or losing, and if you are confident that the signal looks good, assume that you have a 60\npercent chance of winning and a 40 percent chance of losing. Don't even worry about how far the move might go. Simply evaluate whether the setup\nlooks good, and if it does, assume that the probability of a move up of any size has a 60 percent chance or better compared to a move down of the\nsame size. This is the probability (or directional probability) of an equidistant move and is discussed later in this chapter. If the potential reward is\nmany times larger than the risk, many traders will also consider taking a trade that is unlikely to be successful. When that is the case, they should\nassume that the probability is 40 percent. If the probability of success is much less than that, very few traders would ever consider taking the trade,\nno matter how great the potential reward is.\nIt is important to understand the implications of these probabilities. Otherwise, it is easy for a beginning trader to become upset when the market\ndoes something that he thinks is improbable, or even impossible. No matter how confident you feel, the market will often do the exact opposite of\nwhat you believe that it should. If you are 60 percent confident that the market will go up, that means that in 40 percent of the cases it will instead go\ndown, and you will lose if you take the trade. You should not ignore that 40 percent any more than you would dismiss someone 30 yards away who\nis shooting at you, but who has only a 40 percent chance of hitting you. Forty percent is very real and dangerous, so always respect the traders who\nbelieve the opposite of you.\nIf you don't take a trade because you think that the probability is only 50 percent and you only take trades where you think the probability is 60\npercent, then in half of the cases you will miss a good trade. This is just part of trading and a consequence of the edges being as small as they have\nto be in a zero-sum game with a huge number of very smart people, where half of them believe the exact opposite of the other half. Never get upset\nor confused by the market doing anything. Simply accept that anything is possible, even if you do not understand why it is happening. No one ever\nreally understands why, and the reason is never important. You make money from math, not from reasons, so if someone takes trades only when\nthe trader's equation is strongly favorable, that trader is in a good position to consistently make money.\nYou have to remain in your comfort zone if you expect to trade profitably for many years. Some traders like trades where the reward is several\ntimes greater than the risk, and they are willing to win on only 30 to 40 percent of their trades. This approach has a favorable trader's equation, but\nmost trades have a reward that is only about as large as the risk. This means that these traders will choose to miss most trades that take place\nevery day because they don't believe that the reward is large enough to justify the low probability of success. Other traders will only trade high\nprobability setups, and are willing to accept a reward that is only as large as the risk. However, very often when the market is trending, the pullbacks\nare small and the probability of the setups is often less than 50 percent. For example, if there is a weak bear channel with prominent tails, there\nmight be a sell signal at the bottom of the channel. The market looks like the odds favor the formation of a trading range, but bears who are willing\nto short at the bottom, looking for a swing that is two or three times as large as their risk, will do very well. The traders who only want high probability\ntrades will sit and watch the bear continue for 10 or 20 bars as they wait for a high probability reversal setup to buy or pullback to short. This is also\nan acceptable approach to trading. Some traders are comfortable in all environments and adjust their style to the market. This allows them to trade\nprofitably all day long, which is the goal of every trader. The reality is that most good traders have a particular style and wait for setups consistent\nwith that style.\nScalpers seek relatively small profits compared to the risk that they incur (they should go for a reward that is at least as large as the risk), and\nneed a high probability of success to create a positive trader's equation. Don't assume that this means that they will only trade flags, because many\nwill also trade strong breakouts. With a strong breakout, the stop theoretically is beyond the spike, which can be far away (for example, in a four bull\ntrend bar breakout, the initial stop is theoretically below the low of the first bar, although most traders would not risk that much). However, since the\nbreakout is strong, there is a 60 percent chance or better of an equidistant move. This means that they can take a trade with high risk, because the\nreward is equally high and the probability is also high. To keep their dollars at risk the same as it is for their other trades, they have to trade smaller\nvolume.\nOne of the most important decisions that traders make all day long is whether the bulls or the bears will win at the high or low of the prior bar. For\nexample, if there is a strong bull trend bar, will there be more bears selling to initiate shorts, and bulls selling out of their longs and taking profits\naround the high and close of the bar, mostly using market and limit orders, or will there be more bulls initiating new longs and bears buying back\ntheir shorts, mostly using stop orders? Similarly, at the low, will there be more buying or more selling? Traders try to assess the probability of\nmaking enough of a profit to offset the risk that they need to assume in a trade. Their goal is to make money over time, and they know that they will\noften lose. However, for them to be profitable in the long run, they need to be taking trades that have favorable (positive) trader's equations.\nOnce you see a possible setup, the first thing you have to do is determine how far away your protective stop has to be. Once you know your risk,\nyou can decide on the number of shares or contracts that you can trade, keeping your total risk to within your normal limits. For example, if you\nnormally risk $500 when you buy a stock, and you think that you would need to have your protective stop on the trade in question at about $1.00\nbelow your entry price, then you can trade 500 shares. You then decide on what the probability of the trade is. If you cannot tell, then you assume\nthat it is 50 percent. If it is 50 percent, then your potential reward should to be at least twice the size of your risk to make the trade worth taking. If\nyou cannot reasonably expect to make $2.00 on that long, don't take the trade. If the chance of success is 60 percent, then your reward has to be at\nleast equal to your risk, and if that $1.00 profit target is unreasonable, don't take the trade. If you do take the trade, make sure to use at least a\n$1.00 profit target, since that is the minimum that you need to have a positive trader's equation when the risk is $1.00 and the probability is 60\npercent.\nEvery trade needs a mathematical basis. Assume that you have to risk two points in the Emini and you are considering a short setup. Is it 60\npercent certain that you can make two points before losing two points? Is there a 70 percent chance of making one point, or a 40 percent chance of\nmaking four points? If the answer to any of these is yes, then there is at least a minimum mathematical reason to take the trade. If the answer to all\nof them is no, then consider the same three possibilities for a long. If the answer is yes for any of the three choices, then consider taking the trade. If\nthe answer is no for both the bulls and the bears, then entering on a stop is not a good approach at the moment, and the market is unclear. This\nmeans that it is in a trading range, and experienced traders can look to short above bars and buy below bars with limit orders.\nThere are three variables to the trader's equation, and traders might focus on one over the other three because of their personalities. For\nexample, a trader who needs a high winning percentage to be able to stay focused for the entire day will tend to look for trades where that is\npossible and would therefore have to be willing to accept relatively less reward and more risk. When the probability is high, the imbalance is\nconspicuous and the market will neutralize it quickly. The result is that the move usually lasts for only a few bars, and therefore the reward generally\nhas to be small. Because the probability is often high and risk is small for a good scalp setup, traders will often trade their largest position size\nwhen taking a strong scalp. At the other extreme are traders who want their reward to be much larger than their risk, and to achieve that goal, they\nwill have to be comfortable winning on only about 40 percent of their trades. When the probability is low, traders often trade smaller and some look\nto add on as the market goes their way. It is therefore common for a swing trader to take a smaller initial position than a scalp trader. Someone\n", "text_clean": "stop. The difficulty in solving the equation is assigning a value to the probability, which can never be known with certainty. In general, if you are uncertain, assume that you have a 50 percent of winning or losing, and if you are confident that the signal looks good, assume that you have a 60 percent chance of winning and a 40 percent chance of losing. Don't even worry about how far the move might go. Simply evaluate whether the setup looks good, and if it does, assume that the probability of a move up of any size has a 60 percent chance or better compared to a move down of the same size.

To get that, the trader has to accept some combination of lower reward and lower\nprobability of success. There are other traders who take whatever trade is present and trade it appropriately, based on the context. When the\nprobability is relatively high, they will take profits sooner. When the most important feature of the trade appears to be the reward that it offers, they\naccept that the probability will be less and that they have to be willing to swing more of their position to make the strategy work over time. Many\ntrades are in between these extremes and have about a 50 percent chance of success. Whenever a trader takes one, he should always try for a\nreward that is about twice the size of his risk, to keep the trader's equation positive.\nEven though a low-probability trade can have a potential reward that is much larger than the risk and therefore be a great trade, there is an\ninherent problem for most traders. Because swing trades have a large reward, by definition, they must also have either relatively low probabilities or\nlarge risks. A trade cannot exist with a high probability of making a large reward relative to the risk. Why not? Remember, there has to be someone\nwho will take the other side of your trade, and since institutions control the market, then you have to believe that an institutional trader is willing to\ntrade against you. If your probability of success is 80 percent, his is 20 percent. If your reward is six points, his risk is six points. If your risk is two\npoints, his reward is two points. So if you think that you have an 80 percent chance of making six points while risking two points, then you believe\nthat there are institutional traders willing to take the opposite side of your trade, where they have a 20 percent chance of making only two points\nwhile risking six points. Since that is virtually impossible in a huge market, you have to assume that your assessment of the variables is wrong and\nthe trade is not nearly as good as you think. No institution has to be willing to do the exact opposite of what you are doing, but the market, which is\ncomposed of all institutions and is basically a single big institution, does. So some combination of institutions has to be willing to do the opposite of\neverything that you do, and if your trade is so great, then theirs is horrible, and the market would never allow it to develop. Yes, there are many naïve\npeople who would be willing to take the other side of your trade because of their misread of the market, but the market is very efficiently controlled\nby institutions, and they would never let an edge get that large. You should assume that both sides of virtually every trade that takes place is being\nplaced by an institution, or by an individual placing a trade that an institution would take if that individual did not place the trade. Individuals place\nlots of trades, but they cannot move the market, no matter how ignorant they are willing to be with their orders. Their orders can only get filled if an\ninstitution is willing to place the same order. For example, if the Emini is at 1264 and you are long with a protective sell stop at 1262, your stop\ncannot get hit unless there is an institution who is also willing to sell at 1262. This is true for virtually all trades. If the market is going up strongly, why\nwould any institution ever be willing to sell below the market? Because many bought much lower and are looking for reasons to take profits. If they\nbelieve that the market falling to 1262 is a reason to take partial profits, they will sell there. If the market hits your stop, it is not because it was\nrunning stops on the little guys. It is because there were institutions who believed that selling at 1262 was a mathematically sound decision.\nAs any trade starts to move in the direction of having high probability, high reward, and low risk, institutions would act quickly to take advantage\nof it, preventing the edge from ever becoming very big. Also, the firms on the losing side of the edge would act fast to increase their edge. The\nmarket would move fast and far in the form of one or more large trend bars (a spike) in the direction of that profit target, greatly increasing the risk\n(the size of the required stop) before the setup became strong. The weak signal or the low probability makes most swing trades difficult to take. No\none is going to give you money, and trading is always going to be difficult. If you see easy money, you are reading the market wrong and will soon\nfind yourself giving your money to someone else.\nNinety percent or more of all trading in large markets is done by institutions, which means that the market is effectively a collection of institutions.\nAlmost all are profitable over time, and the few that are not soon go out of business. Since institutions are profitable and they are the market, every\ntrade that you take has a profitable trader (a part of the collection of institutions) taking the other side of your trade. No trade can take place without\none institution willing to take one side and another willing to take the other. Seventy percent of all volume is generated by computer algorithms, and\nthe small volume from individual traders is not enough to deter the program trading from its path. The small volume trades made by individuals can\nonly take place if an institution would be willing to take the same trade. If you want to buy at a certain price, the market will not get to that price\nunless one or more institutions also want to buy at that price. You cannot sell at any price unless one or more institutions are willing to sell there,\nbecause the market can only go to a price where there are institutions willing to buy and others willing to sell. If you trade 200 Emini contracts, then\nyou are trading institutional volume and are effectively an institution, and you will sometimes be able to move the market a tick or two. Most\nindividual traders, however, have no ability to move the market, no matter how ignorantly they are willing to trade. The market will not run your stops.\nThe market might test the price where your protective stop is, but it has nothing to do with your stop. It will only test that price if one or more\ninstitutions believe that it is financially sound to sell there and other institutions believe that it is profitable to buy there. At every tick, there are\ninstitutions buying and other institutions selling, and all have proven systems that will make money by placing those trades.\nWhenever a trader is taking a scalp, the trader on the other side is probably a swing trader. However, many swing traders will also take the\nopposite side from other swing traders. Good scalpers cannot not take the other side of trades placed by other good scalpers because the risk\nand reward are about the same for both directions, and only one can have a high probability of success. The scalper has a high probability of\nsuccess, so the trader on the opposite side has a low probability of success. Since he is an institutional trader, you have to believe that his\nmethodology is sound and profitable over time. How can that be if you are making money doing the opposite of him in a zero sum game? Because\nyou are not. Your entry is the opposite, but your management is not. Let's say that you are using a two-point profit target and a two-point stop in the\nEmini and you are shorting above a weak high 1 buy signal bar at the top of a trading range, correctly believing that you have better than a 60\npercent chance of success. The institutional trader is buying as you are selling and his risk might also be two points, which is the opposite of your\nreward (he gets stopped out where you take your profits), but his reward is far greater than your risk. Your protective stop is two points. That is\nwhere you will buy back your short for a loss. However, that is not where he will sell out of his long. His target is probably several times greater, so\nhe can have a positive trader's equation, despite a low probability of success. He might also be using a very wide stop and scaling into his trade,\nboth of which could increase his probability to 60 percent or more, even though the probability of success on his initial entry might be only 40\npercent. If you think about it, low probability trades could not exist if there was no way to manage them to get a positive trader's equation, because\nno institution would ever take them and they would never trigger. They can only trigger if an institution is willing to take them, and an institution would\nnot take them unless there was a way to trade them profitably. Institutions have many ways to manage their trades to ensure a positive trader's\nequation, including scaling in or out, using a wide stop, hedging, and swinging the trade for a reward that is sufficiently larger than the risk, so that\nthey can offset the low probability.\nThe spectrum of market activity is from intensely one-sided, like during the spike phase of a strong trend, to extremely two-sided, like in an\nextremely tight trading range. Most of the time, it is in between, with periods of more one-sided trading alternating with periods when two-sided\ntrading is more dominant. This can easily be seen in a trading range, where trend bars represent one-side trading, and reversals and tails\nrepresent two-sided trading. When the market is in a bull trend and moves above the high of the prior bar, it is breaking out, and when it moves\nbelow the low of the prior bar, it is pulling back. The opposite is true in a bear trend, where a breakout is a move below the low of the prior bar and\na pullback is a move above the high of the prior bar. When the market is extremely one-sided, like during the spike phase of a strong trend,\npullbacks are mostly due to profit taking.

Individuals place lots of trades, but they cannot move the market, no matter how ignorant they are willing to be with their orders. Their orders can only get filled if an institution is willing to place the same order. For example, if the Emini is at 1264 and you are long with a protective sell stop at 1262, your stop cannot get hit unless there is an institution who is also willing to sell at 1262. This is true for virtually all trades. If the market is going up strongly, why would any institution ever be willing to sell below the market? Because many bought much lower and are looking for reasons to take profits. If they believe that the market falling to 1262 is a reason to take partial profits, they will sell there. If the market hits your stop, it is not because it was running stops on the little guys. It is because there were institutions who believed that selling at 1262 was a mathematically sound decision.\nAs any trade starts to move in the direction of having high probability, high reward, and low risk, institutions would act quickly to take advantage of it, preventing the edge from ever becoming very big. Also, the firms on the losing side of the edge would act fast to increase their edge. The market would move fast and far in the form of one or more large trend bars (a spike) in the direction of that profit target, greatly increasing the risk (the size of the required stop) before the setup became strong. The weak signal or the low probability makes most swing trades difficult to take. No one is going to give you money, and trading is always going to be difficult. If you see easy money, you are reading the market wrong and will soon find yourself giving your money to someone else.\nNinety percent or more of all trading in large markets is done by institutions, which means that the market is effectively a collection of institutions.\nAlmost all are profitable over time, and the few that are not soon go out of business. Since institutions are profitable and they are the market, every trade that you take has a profitable trader (a part of the collection of institutions) taking the other side of your trade. No trade can take place without one institution willing to take one side and another willing to take the other. Seventy percent of all volume is generated by computer algorithms, and the small volume from individual traders is not enough to deter the program trading from its path. The small volume trades made by individuals can only take place if an institution would be willing to take the same trade. If you want to buy at a certain price, the market will not get to that price unless one or more institutions also want to buy at that price. You cannot sell at any price unless one or more institutions are willing to sell there, because the market can only go to a price where there are institutions willing to buy and others willing to sell. If you trade 200 Emini contracts, then you are trading institutional volume and are effectively an institution, and you will sometimes be able to move the market a tick or two. Most individual traders, however, have no ability to move the market, no matter how ignorantly they are willing to trade. The market will not run your stops.\nThe market might test the price where your protective stop is, but it has nothing to do with your stop. It will only test that price if one or more institutions believe that it is financially sound to sell there and other institutions believe that it is profitable to buy there. At every tick, there are institutions buying and other institutions selling, and all have proven systems that will make money by placing those trades.\nWhenever a trader is taking a scalp, the trader on the other side is probably a swing trader. However, many swing traders will also take the opposite side from other swing traders. Good scalpers cannot not take the other side of trades placed by other good scalpers because the risk and reward are about the same for both directions, and only one can have a high probability of success. The scalper has a high probability of success, so the trader on the opposite side has a low probability of success. Since he is an institutional trader, you have to believe that his methodology is sound and profitable over time. How can that be if you are making money doing the opposite of him in a zero sum game? Because you are not. Your entry is the opposite, but your management is not. Let's say that you are using a two-point profit target and a two-point stop in the Emini and you are shorting above a weak high 1 buy signal bar at the top of a trading range, correctly believing that you have better than a 60 percent chance of success. The institutional trader is buying as you are selling and his risk might also be two points, which is the opposite of your reward (he gets stopped out where you take your profits), but his reward is far greater than your risk. Your protective stop is two points. That is where you will buy back your short for a loss. However, that is not where he will sell out of his long. His target is probably several times greater, so he can have a positive trader's equation, despite a low probability of success. He might also be using a very wide stop and scaling into his trade, both of which could increase his probability to 60 percent or more, even though the probability of success on his initial entry might be only 40 percent. If you think about it, low probability trades could not exist if there was no way to manage them to get a positive trader's equation, because no institution would ever take them and they would never trigger. They can only trigger if an institution is willing to take them, and an institution would not take them unless there was a way to trade them profitably. Institutions have many ways to manage their trades to ensure a positive trader's equation, including scaling in or out, using a wide stop, hedging, and swinging the trade for a reward that is sufficiently larger than the risk, so that they can offset the low probability.\nThe spectrum of market activity is from intensely one-sided, like during the spike phase of a strong trend, to extremely two-sided, like in an extremely tight trading range. Most of the time, it is in between, with periods of more one-sided trading alternating with periods when two-sided trading is more dominant. This can easily be seen in a trading range, where trend bars represent one-side trading, and reversals and tails represent two-sided trading. When the market is in a bull trend and moves above the high of the prior bar, it is breaking out, and when it moves below the low of the prior bar, it is pulling back. The opposite is true in a bear trend, where a breakout is a move below the low of the prior bar and a pullback is a move above the high of the prior bar. When the market is extremely one-sided, like during the spike phase of a strong trend, pullbacks are mostly due to profit taking.

Remember, there has to\nbe an institution taking the other side of every trade, and he will only do so if it is part of a profitable strategy. There also is a sell vacuum that sucks\nthe market below that bar. It is due to all of the bulls who are eager to either initiate longs or add to their longs, and they have been placing limit\norders at and below the lows of the prior bars, hoping to get long at a small discount. These bulls are eager to get long, but only at a better price. If\nthe prior bar is six ticks tall, many of these bulls will only begin buying at six ticks below the high of the bar or lower (in other words, at the low or\nbelow the bar). This means that there is a relative absence of buyers from one to five ticks down, and the price can get sucked down quickly to find\nbuyers, which it will succeed in doing around the low of the bar. Remember, the bulls who are taking profits are selling out of part of their longs and\nthey need buyers to take the other side of their trade. Once the profit takers decide to take partial profits, they need to be willing to sell at a price\nwhere there will be enough traders willing to buy. Once the market gets high enough, the only traders willing to buy will be those waiting for the\nmarket to fall below the prior bar. If enough bulls want to take profits, the market will have to drop below the prior bar for them to be able to exit part\nof their longs. Other bulls will only begin to take profits on their longs if the market moves below the prior bar, so they will sell out on a stop at one\ntick below the bar. The bulls who are eager to buy will take the other side of the profit taking bulls. There will be very few bears shorting below the\nlow of that bar, so the move down is not due to bears who are looking to swing a short. Although some firms might be scaling into shorts by shorting\non a stop below the prior bar, it is not logical that this would be a significant factor in the first pullback in a strong spike. When the market is\nextremely one-sided, firms looking to short know that the probability may be 80 percent or higher that they can soon short higher, so it does not\nmake sense for them to short here.\nSince small pullbacks in strong trends are mostly due to profit taking, there is usually no good way for the bears to make profits by shorting below\nthe low of the prior bar as the first pullback is forming in a strong bull trend, or for a bull to make money by buying above the high of the prior bar as\nthe first pullback is forming in a strong bear trend. However, when the market breaks above the high of the prior bar in a bull trend or below the low\nof the prior bar in a bear trend, there is a profitable way to manage both a long and a short trade. If there is no way for both the buyers and the\nsellers to make money above the high of the prior bar in a strong bull trend, the market would not trade there, because it can only get there if one\ninstitution can make a profit by buying up there and another can make a profit by selling. The selling up there is a combination of profit taking by\nbulls and shorting by bears, and as the market becomes increasingly two-sided, the shorting by bears becomes a bigger part of the volume. If there\nis no way for both the buyers and sellers to make money when the market moves below the prior bar in a strong bear trend, the market will not trade\nbelow the bar. Why would an institution ever take a trade that is a losing strategy? They never would. Neither the buying firm nor the selling firm has\nto make money on every trade, but every trade has to be part of a winning strategy or else they would not take them.\nIf institutions are smart, profitable, and responsible for every tick, why would they ever buy the highest tick in a bull trend (or sell the lowest tick in a\nbear trend)? It is because that is what their algorithms have been doing profitably all of the way up, and some are designed to continue to do it until\nit is clear that the bull trend is no longer in effect. They lose on that final buy, but make enough on all of their earlier trades to offset that loss.\nRemember, all of their systems lose between 30 and 70 percent of the time, and this is one of those times. There are also HFT firms that will scalp\nfor even a single tick right up to the high tick of a bull trend. The high is always at a resistance level, and many HFT firms will buy a tick or two below\nresistance to try to capture that final tick, if their systems show that this is a profitable strategy. Other institutions are buying as part of a hedge in\nanother market (stocks, options, bonds, currencies, etc.) because they perceive that their risk/reward ratio is better by placing the hedge. The\nvolume is not from small individual traders, because they are responsible for less than 5 percent of the volume at major turning points.\nThe more two-sided the market is, the more likely every breakout and pullback has both institutional bears and bulls initiating trades (rather than\none side simply taking profits, like in the first pullback in a strong spike). They are doing so based on strategies that they have tested and shown to\nbe profitable over time. Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake, so everything is closely scrutinized and has to be effective. The people who\nown that money will demand that the trading have a sound mathematical basis, or else they will move it to a firm whose trading does. When there is\nmostly two-sided trading going on, which is most of the time, there are buyers and sellers entering on every breakout and every pullback, and since\ninstitutions are profitable, all of them are using profitable strategies, even though many have probabilities of success of 40 percent or less.\nIn the example of that one-bar pullback in the strong bull spike, if there is a breakout above the high of that bar, it will be mostly due to eager bulls\nwho are pressing their bets as they add to their longs or initiate new longs. They are buying from someone willing to sell, and those sellers are a\ncombination of profit taking bulls who bought lower and aggressive bears who are beginning to short. Initially, the bears will only be scalpers,\nexpecting only small pullbacks. Some HFT firms will scalp for a profit of only a tick or two, and there is often a high probability setup that will allow\nthem to do so, even above a strong high 1 buy signal bar in a strong trend. Many are using algorithms based on tick charts, which can show tiny\npatterns that are invisible on the 5 minute chart. As the market becomes more two-sided and a trading range begins to develop, bears will begin to\nsell rallies (some will scale in as the market goes higher), like above weak high 1 or high 2 buy signal bars at the top of the range or channel, and\nlook to hold for a swing down. The more two-sided the market becomes, the more bears begin to swing and the more bulls stop swinging and\nbegin to scalp. Eventually most of the swing trading bulls will have taken their profits, at which point most of bulls will be scalpers. When the buy\nsignal bars become weaker, scalpers lose interest in buying because the probability drops, and they will only take high probability trades. Once the\nbull scalpers and most of the swing bulls stop buying, and the shorting is being done more by swing trading bears than bear scalpers, the trend\nreverses.\nEven when the market is entering a trading range, there are still some bulls buying those low probability (around 40 percent) buy setups like the\nweak high 1 and high 2 signal bars at the top of the range. They are swing traders running algorithms that have been proven to be profitable over\ntime when taking these low probability swing trades. They know that the probability of success is falling as the market becomes more of a trading\nrange. However, they also know that their systems are profitable, even if the probability of success is 40 percent or less. Some of their winners will\nbe many times larger than their stops, more than making up for the losers that they experience 60 percent of the time. Their programs can also\nscale in lower, and their lower entries can be larger. This enables them to get out at breakeven or even with a small profit, if they consider their\ninitial premise to be no longer valid and they want to get out of the trade. On most days, you win by shorting the high of that bad high 1 buy signal\nbar at the top of a trading range or weak bull channel. However, there are a few days a month when the market will trend up strongly and create a\nseries of low probability buy signal bars (like dojis or bear trend bars for signal bars), and each one will be followed by a huge rally where the\nreward is many times greater than the risk. On these days, those swing trading programs that buy these low probability setups can make a fortune\nthat is great enough to more than make up for all of those little losses. The scalpers, on the other hand, often miss much of these trends, because\nthey are unwilling to trade the low probability setups. When the market is trending up strongly, most scalpers will see the strength and avoid shorting\nabove weak buy signal bars. They know that selling at the top of a bull trend is risky. “Risky” simply means that the trader's equation is bad, and the\nrisk from trading against a trend is that any low probability with trend setup can result in a huge move. Low probability is usually the flip side of high\nreward, just as high probability usually means that the reward is small (a scalp). Because they see the bull trend, they want to buy. However, since\nthe buy signals look weak, they therefore are relatively low probability setups. The scalper then ends up not buying, and missing a trend that can last\nfor hours and cover many points.

A good scalper will make more\nmoney than a swing trader on most other days. Remember, since the scalper is taking high probability trades and has far more setups to choose\nfrom because his profit goal is smaller, he theoretically has far more profitable trades than the swing trader, which means a smoother equity curve\nand more profitable days.\nWhenever you trade a low probability system, the system has a positive trader's equation, but the chances of winning on any one trade are small.\nEach individual trade has a small chance of success, but if you take all of the setups, the trader's equation for the group is positive. This means that\nyou cannot cherry pick among trades that have a low probability of success, no matter how much larger the reward is than the risk. People have an\nuncanny ability to pick all of the bad cherries and none of the good ones, and often miss that one great trade that is needed to overcome their\nearlier losses. They end up talking themselves out of taking the low probability trades that result in huge profits, and into taking all of the losers,\nwhich always look easier to take. The result is that they lose money. To trade a low probability system, you have to take every strong signal,\nbecause if you cherry pick, you will invariably pick the wrong cherries, and will often miss that one great trade that you need to overcome your\nearlier losses. Most traders are usually unable to take every trade. This exposes them to this risk, and makes low probability trading so difficult to\ntrade profitably.\nAt the other extreme is high probability trading, where a trader sacrifices the size of his reward for a much higher chance of winning on every\ntrade. If a system has a probability of 60 percent or higher and a reward that is at least as large as its risk, then every individual trade has a positive\ntrader's equation. Traders don't need to average every trade with a bunch of other trades to be profitable. Each trade has a positive trader's\nequation, so traders can cherry pick all they want and still make money, and it does not matter if they miss 10 good trades in a row. If a trader\nmisses many trades, but manages to take a few high probability trades, his chance of being profitable is still good. Because of this natural\ntendency to not take every trade, if traders find themselves cherry picking among swing trades, they should consider that most traders should focus\non taking more high probability trades. I, in fact, have a friend who trades the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures, and he wants the smallest\npossible risk on each trade. To achieve that, he trades a 50 tick chart where many of the bars are only two ticks tall, and looks to risk just three or\nfour ticks on each trade. He tries to make eight or more ticks on his trades and, since he is a very good chart reader, he wins on 90 percent of his\ntrades, or so he told me. I assume that means he does not necessarily reach his eight-tick target on all of his trades, and that many of his winners\nhave just a tick or two of profit. He might even count his breakeven trades in his win column if he thinks that losing on 10 percent is the same as\nwinning on 90 percent. In any case, his emphasis is on risk and he assumes that his winning percentage and his reward will take care of\nthemselves if he picks his trades carefully.\nA high-frequency trading firm might place hundreds of thousands of trades every day on a basket of several thousand stocks, and the trades are\nbased on statistics rather than fundamentals. For example, if a firm found that it is profitable to sell a one-tick rally for a one-tick profit and a three-\ntick risk when a stock falls on six consecutive ticks, they might use that as one of their programs. Just how effective do you think their strategies\nare? They have the smartest mathematicians designing and testing them, so you'd think that they surely have to win 70 percent of the time or more.\nI seriously doubt that is the case, though, because their programs are competing against algorithms at other firms, and it is highly unlikely that an\nedge that large could last more than a very short time before other firms spot it and neutralize it. Everything is a trade-off, and their goal is to have\nan extremely reliable system with which they will make money almost every day. If a firm is making 500,000 trades a day, trying for a one- or two-\ntick profit on each trade, I doubt it is winning on 70 percent of its trades. I doubt it because edges are fleeting and small and it is extremely unlikely\nthat they could find 500,000 trades every day where the chance of success is 70 percent. I suspect that their winning percentage is 55 percent or\nless. Remember, a casino's edge is about 3 percent, yet casinos make money every day. How can that be? If you are 99 percent certain that your\nedge is real, and the game is played thousands of times, the math overwhelmingly favors that you will win. The same is true for a high-frequency\ntrading firm. It is accepting a small edge and a relatively large risk in exchange for consistent profits. Wouldn't the HFT firm make more money if it\ntraded setups that are 70 percent certain? Obviously it would, if it could prove mathematically that the setups actually were 70 percent certain. This\nmeans that it cannot, but that does not mean that these setups don't exist. They do, but they are subjective and obviously very difficult to program.\nThis subjectivity gives individual traders an edge. If they develop the ability to make subjective judgments and the ability to not make many\nmistakes, they have an edge. With so many smart people trading, edges are always going to be small and subjective, and it will always be very\ndifficult to consistently capitalize on them; but it can be done and it is the goal of every trader.\nThe earlier you enter, the more profit you stand to make, but your probability of success is less. Some traders prefer a higher winning\npercentage, and they are willing to enter a little later if they can be more certain that their trade will be profitable. For example, if the market might\nbe reversing up, a trader might buy. Another trader might wait for a couple of strong bull trend bars and a clear always-in long buy signal before\nbuying. The trade is more certain, but the trader, having missed part of the move, stands to make less. The trader paid for the better odds with\nsome of the potential profit, in the belief that it was a good trade-off. Some traders feel more comfortable with a very high winning percentage, even\nif that means that they make less on the trade. Other traders prefer a potential reward that is many times greater than the risk, even if that means\nthat they might win only 40 percent of the time. The higher the probability of success, the more obvious the setup is. When a setup is particularly\nobvious, a lot of smart traders will take it, and the imbalance will last for only a bar or two. The market will quickly reach the expected target and then\neither reverse or enter a trading range. That is why the best scalps have limited profit potential but a high probability of success. However, since\nmost traders are unable to consistently pick only the high-probability scalps, they should stick to trades where the potential reward is at least as\ngreat as the risk and the probability is about 60 percent.\nAt any given moment, there are countless possible combinations of reward, risk, and probability, and traders need to have a clear plan. They\ncannot use the probability of making two points while risking two points if they really are planning on exiting with a one-point profit. The minimum\nprobability needed to make a trade mathematically sound is different for the two trades, and traders sometimes will mix the two scenarios up if they\nare overly eager to take a trade. This is a common problem for traders starting out, but it is a sure path to a blown account. You need to get the\nmost you can out of a good trade, because you will always lose the most possible on a bad one, and you need the big profits to make up for those\nlosses.\nIs there ever a situation where the probability of success is 90 percent or higher? One occurs on every trade and is a part of a profitable strategy.\nFor example, if you are long and the market touches your profit taking limit order but does not fill it, you will still hold long, at least briefly, because\nyou think that the chances are good that your order will be filled very soon. Your stop might be below the low of the prior bar, about six ticks away.\nFor you to continue to hold long for that one extra tick of profit while risking six ticks means that you believe, at least at that moment, that you have a\n90 percent chance of success. If you hold onto your position, then you believe that “chances are” that your order will be filled before your stop is hit.\nAlthough most traders never think about the actual math, they cannot continue to think that the trade is good unless the probability of success is\nabout 90 percent.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 176, "text_raw": "There is another situation where a trader can be 90 percent or more certain of a move, but it is not a sensible trade. For example, at any time in\nthe day, there is likely a 95 percent certainty that the market will go up one tick before it goes down 200 ticks and a 95 percent certainty that it will\ngo down one tick before it goes up 200 ticks. However, you would never risk 200 ticks to make one tick, no matter what the odds of success were.\nOne loss would wipe out 200 winners, which means that you need a 99.5 percent chance of success just to break even, and you would have to\nexecute flawlessly 200 times in a row.\nLikewise, is there ever a sound mathematical strategy where the chance of success is only 10 percent? Yes, for example, if the market is in a\nstrong bear trend and has a rally up from a higher low but is now falling again, traders might place limit orders to buy at one tick above the earlier\nlow and protective stops one tick lower. The chance of success might be only 10 percent, but if the market has a strong reversal up, they might\nmake 10 points on their half-point risk. This means that if they took the trade 10 times, they might lose 18 ticks on their nine losers and make 40\nticks on their one win, and have an average profit per trade of 2.2 ticks.\nRemember, your decision about whether to take a trade needs to incorporate probability, risk, and reward, and not just one or two of the\nvariables. In general, whenever the probability of a trade is very high, you should trade most or all of it as a scalp. This is because extremely high-\nprobability situations will not last more than a bar or two before the market corrects them. If something seems very certain, you can be fairly sure\nthat it won't last long enough for a swing trade. The lower the chance of success, the greater the reward has to be relative to the risk. The best\ntrades are trades where the chance of success is 60 percent or more, and the reward is at least as large as the risk and preferably about twice as\nbig. These trades occur every day in most markets, but you have to anticipate them before they set up, and you have to take them once they do set\nup, and manage them well.\nOnce you find a setup, you next must decide whether you should take the trade. The decision is based on a mathematical calculation that\nrequires three inputs: risk, reward, and probability. Unfortunately, there is a natural tendency to consider only the probability. Many beginning traders\nwill see a setup that they feel has a 60 percent chance of being a successful scalp, and they may be right, but they still lose money. How can that\nbe? It is because the decision has to be based on more than just probability. You have to consider how much you stand to gain and how much you\nhave to risk to achieve that gain. Remember, you need the probability of success times the reward to be greater than the probability of failure times\nthe risk. For example, if you are watching the Emini today and see a low 2 just below the falling moving average in a strong bear market, and you\ndecide from your experience that shorting it has about a 70 percent chance of leading to a two-point profit target limit order being filled before a\ntwo-point stop is hit, then you have a 70 percent chance of making two points and a 30 percent chance of losing two points. If you take this type of\ntrade 10 times, you will make 7 × 2 = 14 points and you will lose 3 × 2 = 6 points. Your net profit for the 10 trades is 14 – 6 = 8 points, so your\naverage profit is 0.8 point, or $40, per trade. If you have low commissions of about $5.00 round turn, then your actual average profit is about $35\nper trade. That might not sound like much, but if you can do that twice a day and trade 25 contracts, that is about $1,700 a day and about $350,000\na year.\nIf instead you use a two-point stop and a four-point profit target and take a trade that you think is better than a 50–50 bet, let's still do the math\nusing only a 50 percent probability. If you take 10 trades, you will win four points on five of those trades for 20 points of profit. You will lose two\npoints on the other five trades for a 10-point loss. Your net profit then is 10 points in 10 trades and your average profit is about one point per trade.\nIf you subtract out 0.1 point for your commission, you will average about $45 per trade. Obviously, there will be lots of trades that you will exit before\nyour stop or profit target is hit, but it is reasonable to assume that those will approximately offset each other and therefore this formula is useful in\nguiding you in your trade selection. If you are very selective in your setups and take only trades that have a 70 percent chance of success, if you\ntake 10 trades you will make 7 × 4 = 28 points and lose 3 × 2 = 6 points. Your profit after commissions will average about 2.1 points per trade.\nAlthough you could try to exit using a market order, most traders who use profit targets exit on limit orders and will be filled at their exact price.\nYou can control the risk and reward by your selection of a protective stop and a profit target. If you choose to use a 10-tick stop, that is your risk in\nmost cases. You will sometimes encounter significant slippage, especially in thinner markets, and you have to factor that in as well. For example, if\nyou are trading a small-cap stock and usually have about 10 cents of slippage on stop orders in that stock, and you are using a 50 cent protective\nstop, then your risk is about 60 cents plus your commission. If you trade the Emini and you are not entering just before a report, you usually will not\nhave slippage but you will still have a commission that will be about 0.1 point.\nThe most difficult part of the equation is assessing the probability that your profit-taking limit order will be filled before your protective stop is hit.\nAlthough you know the risk and potential reward because you chose them, it is impossible to ever know the probability precisely. However, you can\noften make an educated guess. If you don't have any confidence in your guess, just use 50 percent since uncertainty means that the market is in a\ntrading range and the probability of a move up is about the same as for a move down.\nHowever, if you are buying at the top of a two-legged pullback to the moving average in a strong bull trend, the probability of success might be 70\npercent. If instead you are buying in a strong bear market at the top of a trading range that is just below the moving average, your probability of\nsuccess might only be 30 percent. That means that if you take 10 trades, you will lose 7 × 2 = 14 points. Since you have only three winners, those\nwinners have to average five points each just to break even! As that is extremely unlikely, you should rarely consider this trade.\nIf you take a trade because you believe that you have a 60 percent probability of making 10 ticks before losing 10 ticks but then over the next few\nbars the market enters a tight trading range, your probability of success has now fallen to about 50 percent. Since it is now a losing strategy to risk\n10 ticks to make 10 ticks if the chance of success is only 50 percent, you should exit the trade as close to breakeven as possible. If you are lucky,\nyou might even be able to make a tick or two. This is part of trade management. The market changes with each tick, and if a successful strategy\nsuddenly becomes a losing strategy, get out and don't rely on hope. Once your premise is no longer workable, just exit and look for another trade.\nYou have to trade the market that you now have and not the one that you had a few minutes ago and not the one you hope will develop over the next\nfew minutes. Hope has no part in trading. You are trading against computers that have no emotion and are coldly objective, and that is how you\nhave to be as well.\nSo what about one-point scalps in the Emini where you are entering on stops? If you are risking two points to make one point, then you have to\nwin twice as often as you lose just to break even. If you add in commissions, then you need to win 70 percent of the time to break even. To make a\nprofit, you have to be right 80 percent or more of the time; even most experienced, profitable traders could not do that long-term. You then have to\nconclude that it is simply not a profitable strategy. If you do it, you will almost certainly lose over time, and since you have to be trading with the\noverriding goal of consistently making money, you cannot trade this way. Yes, there are probably a few trades a day where the probability of making\none point before losing two points is more than 80 percent, and you could theoretically make a lot of money if you are a very good chart reader, if\nyou are very disciplined, if you can spot the best setups in time to place the trades, and if you restrict your one-point scalps to those few setups.\nThis can be a profitable strategy, but the barrier posed by all of those ifs is insurmountable for most traders. It is far better to look for fewer trades\nbut those where you have to be right only 50 to 60 percent of the time to make a profit. One of the problems is that it is fairly easy to win on 60\npercent of one-point scalps, and this high winning percentage reinforces your behavior and makes you believe that you are so close to being able\n", "text_clean": "There is another situation where a trader can be 90 percent or more certain of a move, but it is not a sensible trade. For example, at any time in the day, there is likely a 95 percent certainty that the market will go up one tick before it goes down 200 ticks and a 95 percent certainty that it will go down one tick before it goes up 200 ticks. However, you would never risk 200 ticks to make one tick, no matter what the odds of success were.\nOne loss would wipe out 200 winners, which means that you need a 99.5 percent chance of success just to break even, and you would have to execute flawlessly 200 times in a row.\nLikewise, is there ever a sound mathematical strategy where the chance of success is only 10 percent? Yes, for example, if the market is in a strong bear trend and has a rally up from a higher low but is now falling again, traders might place limit orders to buy at one tick above the earlier low and protective stops one tick lower. The chance of success might be only 10 percent, but if the market has a strong reversal up, they might make 10 points on their half-point risk. This means that if they took the trade 10 times, they might lose 18 ticks on their nine losers and make 40 ticks on their one win, and have an average profit per trade of 2.2 ticks.\nRemember, your decision about whether to take a trade needs to incorporate probability, risk, and reward, and not just one or two of the variables. In general, whenever the probability of a trade is very high, you should trade most or all of it as a scalp. This is because extremely highprobability situations will not last more than a bar or two before the market corrects them. If something seems very certain, you can be fairly sure that it won't last long enough for a swing trade. The lower the chance of success, the greater the reward has to be relative to the risk. The best trades are trades where the chance of success is 60 percent or more, and the reward is at least as large as the risk and preferably about twice as big. These trades occur every day in most markets, but you have to anticipate them before they set up, and you have to take them once they do set up, and manage them well.\nOnce you find a setup, you next must decide whether you should take the trade. The decision is based on a mathematical calculation that requires three inputs: risk, reward, and probability. Unfortunately, there is a natural tendency to consider only the probability. Many beginning traders will see a setup that they feel has a 60 percent chance of being a successful scalp, and they may be right, but they still lose money. How can that be? It is because the decision has to be based on more than just probability. You have to consider how much you stand to gain and how much you have to risk to achieve that gain. Remember, you need the probability of success times the reward to be greater than the probability of failure times the risk. For example, if you are watching the Emini today and see a low 2 just below the falling moving average in a strong bear market, and you decide from your experience that shorting it has about a 70 percent chance of leading to a two-point profit target limit order being filled before a two-point stop is hit, then you have a 70 percent chance of making two points and a 30 percent chance of losing two points. If you take this type of trade 10 times, you will make 7 × 2 = 14 points and you will lose 3 × 2 = 6 points. Your net profit for the 10 trades is 14 – 6 = 8 points, so your average profit is 0.8 point, or $40, per trade. If you have low commissions of about $5.00 round turn, then your actual average profit is about $35 per trade. That might not sound like much, but if you can do that twice a day and trade 25 contracts, that is about $1,700 a day and about $350,000 a year.\nIf instead you use a two-point stop and a four-point profit target and take a trade that you think is better than a 50–50 bet, let's still do the math using only a 50 percent probability. If you take 10 trades, you will win four points on five of those trades for 20 points of profit. You will lose two points on the other five trades for a 10-point loss. Your net profit then is 10 points in 10 trades and your average profit is about one point per trade.\nIf you subtract out 0.1 point for your commission, you will average about $45 per trade. Obviously, there will be lots of trades that you will exit before your stop or profit target is hit, but it is reasonable to assume that those will approximately offset each other and therefore this formula is useful in guiding you in your trade selection. If you are very selective in your setups and take only trades that have a 70 percent chance of success, if you take 10 trades you will make 7 × 4 = 28 points and lose 3 × 2 = 6 points. Your profit after commissions will average about 2.1 points per trade.\nAlthough you could try to exit using a market order, most traders who use profit targets exit on limit orders and will be filled at their exact price.\nYou can control the risk and reward by your selection of a protective stop and a profit target. If you choose to use a 10-tick stop, that is your risk in most cases. You will sometimes encounter significant slippage, especially in thinner markets, and you have to factor that in as well. For example, if you are trading a small-cap stock and usually have about 10 cents of slippage on stop orders in that stock, and you are using a 50 cent protective stop, then your risk is about 60 cents plus your commission. If you trade the Emini and you are not entering just before a report, you usually will not have slippage but you will still have a commission that will be about 0.1 point.\nThe most difficult part of the equation is assessing the probability that your profit-taking limit order will be filled before your protective stop is hit.\nAlthough you know the risk and potential reward because you chose them, it is impossible to ever know the probability precisely. However, you can often make an educated guess. If you don't have any confidence in your guess, just use 50 percent since uncertainty means that the market is in a trading range and the probability of a move up is about the same as for a move down.\nHowever, if you are buying at the top of a two-legged pullback to the moving average in a strong bull trend, the probability of success might be 70 percent. If instead you are buying in a strong bear market at the top of a trading range that is just below the moving average, your probability of success might only be 30 percent. That means that if you take 10 trades, you will lose 7 × 2 = 14 points. Since you have only three winners, those winners have to average five points each just to break even! As that is extremely unlikely, you should rarely consider this trade.\nIf you take a trade because you believe that you have a 60 percent probability of making 10 ticks before losing 10 ticks but then over the next few bars the market enters a tight trading range, your probability of success has now fallen to about 50 percent. Since it is now a losing strategy to risk 10 ticks to make 10 ticks if the chance of success is only 50 percent, you should exit the trade as close to breakeven as possible. If you are lucky, you might even be able to make a tick or two. This is part of trade management. The market changes with each tick, and if a successful strategy suddenly becomes a losing strategy, get out and don't rely on hope. Once your premise is no longer workable, just exit and look for another trade.\nYou have to trade the market that you now have and not the one that you had a few minutes ago and not the one you hope will develop over the next few minutes. Hope has no part in trading. You are trading against computers that have no emotion and are coldly objective, and that is how you have to be as well.\nSo what about one-point scalps in the Emini where you are entering on stops? If you are risking two points to make one point, then you have to win twice as often as you lose just to break even. If you add in commissions, then you need to win 70 percent of the time to break even. To make a profit, you have to be right 80 percent or more of the time; even most experienced, profitable traders could not do that long-term. You then have to conclude that it is simply not a profitable strategy. If you do it, you will almost certainly lose over time, and since you have to be trading with the overriding goal of consistently making money, you cannot trade this way. Yes, there are probably a few trades a day where the probability of making one point before losing two points is more than 80 percent, and you could theoretically make a lot of money if you are a very good chart reader, if you are very disciplined, if you can spot the best setups in time to place the trades, and if you restrict your one-point scalps to those few setups.\nThis can be a profitable strategy, but the barrier posed by all of those ifs is insurmountable for most traders.

However, that 80 percent requirement is simply impossible to reach for most traders, no matter how close they get.\nThe probability, risk, and reward change for every trade on every time frame with each tick. For example, if traders bought a high 2 bull flag in the\nEmini and thought that it had a 60 percent chance of making two points before losing two points, all three variables change with every tick. If the\nmarket races up for six ticks with all of the pullbacks being only one or two ticks, the probability of their original premise being correct might now be\n80 percent. Since they need only four more ticks to scalp out with two points of profit, their reward is now four ticks. They might raise their protective\nstops to one tick below the low of the current bar, even before the bar closes, and this might be only three ticks below their entry price. This reduces\nthe risk of the original trade to three ticks. They now might have an 80 percent chance of making the remaining two ticks while risking three ticks,\nwhich is a great trader's equation. If they were flat and saw this happening, however, they should not buy at the market and risk three ticks to make\ntwo ticks. An institution that is trading momentum and paying minuscule commissions can profitably take that trade, but individual traders would\nalmost certainly lose money because they could not execute the trade fast enough and correctly often enough to make it work. Also, commissions\ngreatly reduce the profitability on almost all trades where the reward is less than one point. At every moment, there are traders holding long and\nshort trades with every imaginable combination of risk, reward, and probability. Although a day trader is concerned with every tick, a trader trading\noff of the daily or weekly charts would ignore small movements, because they would be too small to have any significant impact on the trader's\nequation. If, instead of going up immediately after entry, the market falls four ticks, then the scalper has four ticks left of risk and 12 ticks for reward,\nwhich is a great risk/reward ratio, but the probability would have fallen greatly to maybe 35 percent. This is still a sound strategy, but not nearly as\nprofitable over time. Because it still has a favorable trader's equation, the trader should not exit early, unless the original premise has changed and\nthe probability becomes maybe 30 percent or less.\nOn the other hand, if the trader's equation ever becomes marginal, he should try to exit quickly with as much profit as he can. If the trader's\nequation becomes negative, he should get out immediately, even if he ends up with a loss. Traders regularly exit early with a smaller profit if the\nmarket is not behaving as well as they anticipated, and that is the proper thing to do. However, if you find yourself exiting most trades with a smaller\nprofit than you originally planned to make, you will probably lose money. Why is that? It is because you solved the trader's equation using one profit\ntarget, but it is not the one that you actually planned to use, if you were honest with yourself. Your smaller target probably results in a less favorable\ntrader's equation, and most likely a negative one, which means that your approach will lose money. Yes, exiting with a smaller profit target has a\ngreater chance of success, but when you start using a profit target that is smaller than your risk, your probability has to be unrealistically high. So\nhigh, in fact, that you almost certainly cannot maintain it, which means that you will lose money.\nWhenever traders are thinking about taking a trade, they have to find some combination of probability, risk, and reward that creates a positive\ntrader's equation. For example, if they are buying a pullback in a bull trend in the Emini and have to risk two points, they then have to consider the\nprobability of the move reaching their profit target. If the target is one point, they have to be 80 percent certain of success or else the trade will lose\nmoney over time. If they think that a two-point profit target is reasonable, they have to be 60 percent certain to have a positive trader's equation. If\nthey think that the bull trend is very strong and that they can make four points, they only need a 40 percent chance of success to have a profitable\nstrategy. If at least one of those possibilities makes mathematical sense, they can take the trade. Once they enter, every new tick changes all three\nvariables. If they were only 40 percent certain when they entered that the market would reach four points, and not 60 percent certain of making two\npoints or 80 percent certain of making one point, but the entry bar was very strong, they could reevaluate all of the potential profit targets. Once the\nentry bar closes, if it is a strong bull trend bar they can tighten their stops, which now might be only four ticks below their entry. They might now think\nthat there is a 60 percent chance of making two points while risking those four ticks, and this means that scalping out for two points has become a\nreasonable choice. If they think that the chance of making four points is now 50 percent, then this also has a strong trader's equation, especially\nsince their risk is now only four ticks, and they can continue to hold for four points.\nAlthough it is so important to take trades only where the reward is at least as large as the risk, successful traders actually risk five or more times\nwhat they stand to gain many times a day. All traders who are trying to exit on profit-taking limit orders are scalpers once the market gets to within a\nfew ticks of their orders, and was discussed earlier. For example, if traders have limit orders to take eight ticks (two points) of profit on a long in the\nEmini, and the market reaches six or seven ticks and they think that their orders will get filled, they will hold their positions a little longer to find out.\nHowever, they probably have protective stops that are four to six ticks below (either below the low of the most recent bar or at breakeven), so at the\ninstant that the market comes to within a tick of filling their orders, they are risking about five ticks to make that one final tick. This is effectively an\nextreme scalp, but is it sound? Only if they have about a 90 percent chance of success. If not, they should exit, at least theoretically. In practice, if the\nmarket is rising and comes to within a tick of filling their limit orders, the trade might have about a 90 percent chance of success at that instant,\nespecially if the momentum up is strong. Traders will usually hold to see if the next tick is up, filling their orders, or down. By holding on to their\npositions, they believe that their chance of success is 90 percent. They probably do not think of it in mathematical terms, but that has to be what\nthey believe if they think it is worth holding on to the trade. It is worth it only if it makes mathematical sense, and that math must include a probability\nof 90 percent, because that is what is required to keep the trader's equation positive when the risk is about five times greater than the reward. If the\nmarket trades down for a couple of ticks, they are then trying for three ticks of profit and risking to the low of the prior bar, or breakeven, which at\nthat point is about three or four ticks. The probability of success is probably still 70 percent or higher, making the trader's equation still positive,\nalthough not strongly so.\nProgrammers are aware of this and there are therefore algorithms out there that will buy once the market comes to within a tick or two of a logical\ntarget and then falls back for a couple of ticks. In these cases, they probably have to risk about three ticks to make three ticks. Their commissions\nare so small as to not be a factor in their decisions. High-frequency trading firm algorithms are probably buying at a tick or two below the obvious\ntarget, but they will probably exit if the market falls back for a couple of ticks. The programmers know that the math is terrible if the risk is several\ntimes larger than the potential reward, and will not allow that to happen (unless they are scaling in). All of these programs create buying pressure\nand increase the chances that the target will be reached.\nThe individual traders are holding long while risking five ticks to make one tick for only a fraction of a second, and for that brief moment they are\nbetting that they have a 90 percent chance of making one more tick while risking five ticks (and they are probably right). Otherwise, they would exit.\nIf they tried to exit at seven ticks of profit instead of eight and the market came to within a tick of filling this new profit-taking limit order, for that\ninstant they are risking about four ticks to make one. They need about an 80 percent chance of success, or else they should exit. Why not exit with\nsix ticks of profit? Their risk is always going to be to below the low of the prior bar, so they are always going to have to risk about four to six ticks to\nmake that final tick. The extremely bad trader's equation, with a risk many times greater than the reward, exists for only a fraction of a second. Most\ntraders are willing to take that brief risk, because they know that the trader's equation will be much better in a few seconds. Either traders will have\ntheir profit and no more risk, or the market will fall back for a few ticks and they would then be risking about three ticks to make three ticks on a bet\nthat is usually 60 percent or higher.\nShould an individual trader simply buy a one- or two-tick pullback on a limit order once the market comes to within a tick or so of a 10-tick move\n", "text_clean": "to be successful.

(Most of the time, the market has to go 10 ticks above the signal bar for a\ntrader to exit with eight ticks of profit.) The logic is sound, but this is probably as minimally positive a trader's equation as traders would ever find,\nand they would be wiser to look for stronger trades. Also, commissions become significant on tiny scalps, making it virtually impossible for an\nindividual trader to make money from trading them. Does this mean that the trader who bought on a stop above the signal bar should exit as soon\nas the market pulls back a tick or two? It might be mathematically sensible, but most traders would simply hold the long, risking to no worse than\nbreakeven, and allow the market a little more time to fill their profit-taking limit orders. Computers don't have the problems of dealing with emotions\nand needing time to think, but most algorithms probably would still hold, briefly risking the five or so ticks while trying to make the final tick or two.\nRemember, once the market pulls back a couple of ticks, traders are trying to make three ticks from that point and might be risking only three\nticks, and the probability of success is probably 60 percent or better. At that moment, they have a profitable trader's equation. Traders without a\nposition might consider buying at that point, risking about three ticks to make three ticks, but commissions then become disproportionally large.\nFor example, they might be paying a $5.00 round turn commission to make $37.50 (three ticks), reducing their net profit to $32.50 while risking\n$42.50 (three ticks plus the commission), or about 30 percent more than their potential profit. With the reward less than the risk, the trader's\nequation would probably be negative. At the extreme, if traders tried to scalp one tick with a risk that is the same size as their reward, even if their\nprobability of success is 80 percent, they will lose money. This is because a $5.00 round turn commission makes the risk ($12.50 for one tick, plus\na $5.00 commission, for a total risk of $17.50) much greater than the reward ($12.50 for one tick, minus a $5.00 commission, for a net profit of\n$7.50). From a practical standpoint, traders should stick to their original plan and rely on their stops. If the move up to their limit orders is labored,\nthey might change their plan and try to exit with one point of profit, but most traders cannot read the market that quickly and are better off just relying\non their bracket orders.\nWhen the trader's equation indicates that a trade is bad, then it is often good for traders who are fading the move with limit orders. For example,\nif entering on a low 1 short setup using a stop entry order would result in a losing trader's equation, traders should consider instead buying at the\nlow of that short signal bar. If the traders who shorted on a stop below the low 1 signal bar had about a 50 percent chance of making four ticks while\nrisking eight ticks, their strategy would be a loser over time. If different traders bought at the low 1 low, they, too, would have about a 50–50 chance\nof the market going up seven ticks to the stop of those short traders before falling six ticks to the short traders’ profit target. If they risked six ticks\nand used a six-tick profit target, they would have a breakeven strategy. If they chose an especially weak-looking low 1 setup, like a doji signal bar at\nthe bottom of a trading range, their probability of success might be 70 percent and their strategy would be profitable. This is discussed more in\nChapter 28 on limit orders.\nBeginners often make the mistake of considering only one or two of the variables in the equation, being in denial about the probability, or even\nfooling themselves into believing that their risk is smaller or their reward is larger than they actually are. For example, if there is a strong bull trend\non the 5 minute Emini and all of the buy setups have had entries within a few ticks of the high of the current leg, traders might be afraid that there is\nnot enough room at the top of their computer screen for them to make a profit on a long, so they don't buy. They see so much room to the bottom of\nthe chart that they think that shorting has a better chance of success. To minimize risk, they short on the 1 minute chart. After they are short, they\nplace their protective stop at one tick above their signal bar, risking about six ticks to make a four-tick scalp. Yet they consistently lose money. How\ncan that be when the risk is so small? They lose because they do not understand market inertia and the propensity of trend reversals to fail, and\nthey erroneously assumed that the probability of success for their countertrend trade was better than 50 percent. In fact, when there is a trend, most\nattempts at reversing fail, so the odds of success are probably more like 30 percent. The 70 percent certain trade was the long, buying near the top\nof the bull trend!\nThese traders thought that they were risking six ticks and that the reward was the 40 ticks to the bottom of the chart, so even if the chance of\nsuccess was only 30 percent, they would still make money. The reality is that if the market started down, they would have scalped out with just four\nticks and never held for 40 ticks. They would instinctively sense that they had gotten away with something and would have quickly taken their small\nprofit, especially if they had just lost on their prior three shorts. This means that they also erroneously used 40 for their reward in the equation when\nin fact they were really planning on taking only a four-tick reward. Also, if the market went up instead of down, they might cancel their stops and add\non by shorting another contract at six ticks above their initial entry, thinking that a second entry was even more reliable in a market that had to be\ndue for a pullback. Their risk is then 12 ticks from their first entry and six ticks from their second. This means that they also were wrong in their initial\nassumption of a six-tick risk. Their average risk has increased to nine ticks. They now want to get out of both shorts near their original entry price.\nWhen the market starts down, they begin to feel that it won't reach their target; so they get out of both trades at two ticks above their target, making\ntwo ticks on their second entry and losing two on their first. Their net profit is zero, so their average profit is also zero, meaning that the reward\nvariable in the equation was zero. So instead of risking six ticks to make 40 ticks and having a 30 percent chance of success, which is a potentially\nprofitable strategy, they risked nine ticks to make zero ticks in a trade with only a 30 percent chance of success. That is why their accounts are\nslowly disappearing.\nTraders often fool themselves into taking low-probability trades by telling themselves that they will use a reward that is much larger than the risk,\nwhich is needed in low-probability trades, when they really expect to exit with a much smaller profit target. For example, if traders buy in the middle\nof barbwire and need to risk two points to below the signal bar, they have about a 50 percent chance of making two points before their stops are\nhit. That is a losing strategy. However, they know that if they hold for four points, the probability might fall to 40 percent, but they would then have a\npositive trader's equation. They then take the trade, and they are proud of themselves for carefully considering the math. However, once they have\none or two points of profit, they exit, fearful that most barbwire breakouts do not go far. They are happy to have the small profit, but don't realize that\nif they traded this strategy 10 times they would lose money. They might actually take this type of trade 10 times over the next month, along with a\nhundred other trades, only to discover that they ended up down on the month. They will look back with confusion, remembering all of the smart\nthings that they did, but they will be oblivious to the reality that they took many trades with positive trader's equations but managed them incorrectly\nand traded them in a way that had negative trader's equations. Traders must be honest with themselves. This is not a dream. The money is very\nreal, and when you lose it, it is gone forever. If you take a trade with a favorable trader's equation, you must manage it correctly to make the math\nwork for you instead of against you.\nAt every instant, there is a mathematical edge to buying and to selling, even during the strongest spikes. How can this be true? By inference.\nMost of the trading is being done by institutional computers, which are using algorithms that have been shown to be profitable over time. So even if\nthe market is in a free fall, there are computers buying as the market is collapsing. Every short, no matter how large, has to have a buyer taking the\nopposite side of the trade. When the volume is huge, the buyers have to be institutions because there are simply not enough small traders to offset\nthe huge volume of shorts. Some of the buy programs are buying because the programmers have statistical proof that enough big breakouts fail\nand reverse sharply so that they will make a profit by buying strong bear breakouts. Other programs are buying back their shorts from much higher\nprices.

When the market is not in an\nunusually strong bull or bear spike, there are institutional buyers and sellers at every tick, which could happen only if there was proof that their\nstrategies were mathematically sound, based on the trader's equation. Each firm has its own combination of risk, reward, probability, and expected\nduration for every trade, and many scale into and out of their trades. The market could not exist unless there was a large number of big participants,\nand the majority of them have to be profitable over time. Otherwise, they would go out of business and the market would cease to exist as the huge\nmarket that it is. That means that the majority of them are trading logical, sound strategies, and that they are making money, even when they\nsometimes buy in a bear trend or short in a bull trend. Individual traders lack the deep pockets to run complex strategies, but there are enough\neffective simple ones for experienced traders to make money over time.\nFor the strong (i.e., institutional) bulls to get filled, they need enough volume on the other side, which can only come from strong bears. It is\nreasonable to assume that both the strong bears and the strong bulls make money over time or else they would not be investing enough money for\nthem to be considered strong. There are countless possible strategies, including hedging and scaling in and out, and different strong bulls and\nbears will be using everything imaginable to make money. However, even in the absence of complex strategies, it is common for mathematically\nsound long and short setups to coexist. For example, if there is a strong bull trend that is overdone and likely to pull back, a strong bull can buy at\nthe market and hold throughout the pullback and then take profits once the market resumes the uptrend and reaches a new high. At the same time\nthat the strong bull bought, a strong bear could have shorted and made money as the market sold off to the moving average. Another example is\nwhen the market is in a tight trading range. Let's say that the Emini is in a range that is only five ticks tall. The probability of either an upside or a\ndownside breakout is about 50 percent. If a bull bought in the middle of the range or a bear sold in the middle, each might have to risk only three\nticks to make four or more ticks on a small breakout. Since each has a reward that is larger than the risk and about a 50 percent chance of\nsuccess, they each have a mathematically sound trade, even if they took their trades at the same time, and even if each took the opposite side of\nthe other's trade.\nMath can be deceptive, and it is risky to place trades on math alone unless you fully understand probability distributions. For example, let's say\nthat you test every trading day of the year over the past 10 years to see if it is likely that the close of any given date has a high probability of being\nabove the open. If you discover that some day in the near future, perhaps March 21, has closed above its open in nine of the past 10 years, you\nmight conclude that there is some market force operating, maybe related to the upcoming end of the quarter, that makes that day close up so often.\nThat conclusion is erroneous, though, because you do not understand distributions. If you were to throw a deck of cards up in the air 10 times and\nthen record which cards landed face up, you would discover that some cards landed face up nine out of the 10 times. Maybe the eight of hearts was\none of them. Do you feel 90 percent certain that it will land face up on the 11th toss, or do you suspect that the odds are really 50–50 and that it was\njust luck that some cards were face up in eight or nine of the 10 tosses, and others were face up only one, two, or three times? If you toss a coin 10\ntimes and it lands on heads eight times, are you willing give someone odds that it will land heads up on the next toss, or do you think it was just\nluck? The message is clear. If you test enough ideas or enough inputs in any system, you will discover that some have worked in eight out of 10\ntests and others have failed in eight out of 10. That is just the distribution of outcomes under a bell curve and has nothing to do with actual\nlikelihood, and that is why so many traders who design great back-tested systems lose money when they trade them in real time. What they believe\nis 80 percent likely is really only 50–50, and since that is the reality, they need a profit target that is much larger than their risk to have any chance at\nmaking money. But in a 50–50 market, the profit target always pretty much equals the risk, and therefore, at best, their system will lose at least\ncommissions and not make money.\nMost traders should look for trades where they can make a swing profit. When the Emini has an average daily range of about 10 to 15 points, a\ntrader can usually risk about two points on a trade, and a swing trade is any trade where the profit is four points or more. Although the probability of\nsuccess is usually only 40 to 50 percent for most of these trades, this type of trading gives most traders the best chance of making a living as a\ntrader. There are usually about five setups a day, and traders will likely have to place at least three trades a day to make sure that they each catch\nat least one big winner. If they are patient and disciplined, they will be about breakeven on the trades that do not result in four or more points of\nprofit. Some of those trades will be one- to three-point winners, while others will be one- to two-point losers. However, they need the four-point\nwinners to make the system profitable. A trader who wants to take more trades a day will have to be willing to accept a smaller profit target, like two\npoints, because there are rarely five to 10 trades in a day where a trader can make four points. However, there are usually that many trades where\na skilled trader can make two points while risking two points. These traders, then, need to be right at least 60 percent of the time to be profitable.\nThis is more difficult, but it is a reasonable goal for traders who are particularly good at reading price action.\nIn actual trading, most successful traders have routines and do not have to think about the math when they place trades. For example, if you only\nlook for a couple of four-point swings a day and always use a two-point stop, and you have been profitable using this approach for a few years, you\nwill likely just look at a setup and ask yourself if it looks good without thinking about the probability. You know from experience that taking these\ncertain setups with a two-point stop and a four-point profit target leads to your account being larger at the end of the month, and you do not need to\nthink about anything else. As a general rule, beginners should use profit targets that are at least as large as their protective stops, because they\nthen need only about a 50 percent win rate to break even. No one should ever take a trade with a long-term goal of breaking even. However, that is\none of the steps that traders must take en route to becoming profitable. Once there, they can then try to increase the probability of success by being\nmore selective in their setups, and also by using a larger profit target. This could be all that they need to become consistently profitable.\nThere is another point about reversal signals. If a signal is not clear, you should not take it, but you can use it to exit part or all of a position that\nyou currently are holding. For example, if you are long and the market is now trying to reverse, but there is too much recent strength to consider\nreversing to short, you should consider exiting part or all of your position. A weak reversal signal is a good reason to take profits but a bad reason\nto initiate a trade against the current trend.\nIn trading, the less you have to think about, the more likely you will be successful, so having some guidelines can make trading a little easier. If\nyou believe that there is a directional probability of at least 60 percent for a move that is the same size as or greater than the risk required, you can\nuse either your risk or your reward as a starting point. In a breakout that you believe will be successful and have follow-through, you usually have to\nbe at least 60 percent certain to draw that conclusion, and therefore if you risk the same as or less than what you expect for your reward, you have a\nprofitable strategy. For example, if you buy at the top of a strong $2.00 bull spike in Apple (AAPL), a reasonable risk is to the bottom of the spike.\nSince you are risking $2.00 and the spike often leads to a measured move up, you can take partial or total profits $2.00 higher. If this is more than\nyou are comfortable risking, just trade fewer shares. You can also wait to buy a 50 cent pullback to reduce your risk to $1.50 while increasing the\nsize of your potential reward to $2.50.\nIf there is a breakout of the top of a $3.00 trading range in AAPL and you think the breakout will be successful, then you can risk to the bottom of\nthe trading range, which might be $4.00 below, or below the bottom of the spike that was the breakout, which might be $2.00. Since a measured\nmove up using the height of the trading range is likely, you can look to take partial or full profits at $3.00 above the top of the range.\n", "text_clean": "frequency trading firms are also buying for small scalps, and other firms are buying to hedge shorting in other markets. When the market is not in an unusually strong bull or bear spike, there are institutional buyers and sellers at every tick, which could happen only if there was proof that their strategies were mathematically sound, based on the trader's equation. Each firm has its own combination of risk, reward, probability, and expected duration for every trade, and many scale into and out of their trades. The market could not exist unless there was a large number of big participants, and the majority of them have to be profitable over time. Otherwise, they would go out of business and the market would cease to exist as the huge market that it is. That means that the majority of them are trading logical, sound strategies, and that they are making money, even when they sometimes buy in a bear trend or short in a bull trend. Individual traders lack the deep pockets to run complex strategies, but there are enough effective simple ones for experienced traders to make money over time.\nFor the strong (i.e., institutional) bulls to get filled, they need enough volume on the other side, which can only come from strong bears. It is reasonable to assume that both the strong bears and the strong bulls make money over time or else they would not be investing enough money for them to be considered strong. There are countless possible strategies, including hedging and scaling in and out, and different strong bulls and bears will be using everything imaginable to make money. However, even in the absence of complex strategies, it is common for mathematically sound long and short setups to coexist. For example, if there is a strong bull trend that is overdone and likely to pull back, a strong bull can buy at the market and hold throughout the pullback and then take profits once the market resumes the uptrend and reaches a new high. At the same time that the strong bull bought, a strong bear could have shorted and made money as the market sold off to the moving average. Another example is when the market is in a tight trading range. Let's say that the Emini is in a range that is only five ticks tall. The probability of either an upside or a downside breakout is about 50 percent. If a bull bought in the middle of the range or a bear sold in the middle, each might have to risk only three ticks to make four or more ticks on a small breakout. Since each has a reward that is larger than the risk and about a 50 percent chance of success, they each have a mathematically sound trade, even if they took their trades at the same time, and even if each took the opposite side of the other's trade.\nMath can be deceptive, and it is risky to place trades on math alone unless you fully understand probability distributions. For example, let's say that you test every trading day of the year over the past 10 years to see if it is likely that the close of any given date has a high probability of being above the open. If you discover that some day in the near future, perhaps March 21, has closed above its open in nine of the past 10 years, you might conclude that there is some market force operating, maybe related to the upcoming end of the quarter, that makes that day close up so often.\nThat conclusion is erroneous, though, because you do not understand distributions. If you were to throw a deck of cards up in the air 10 times and then record which cards landed face up, you would discover that some cards landed face up nine out of the 10 times. Maybe the eight of hearts was one of them. Do you feel 90 percent certain that it will land face up on the 11th toss, or do you suspect that the odds are really 50–50 and that it was just luck that some cards were face up in eight or nine of the 10 tosses, and others were face up only one, two, or three times? If you toss a coin 10 times and it lands on heads eight times, are you willing give someone odds that it will land heads up on the next toss, or do you think it was just luck? The message is clear. If you test enough ideas or enough inputs in any system, you will discover that some have worked in eight out of 10 tests and others have failed in eight out of 10. That is just the distribution of outcomes under a bell curve and has nothing to do with actual likelihood, and that is why so many traders who design great back-tested systems lose money when they trade them in real time. What they believe is 80 percent likely is really only 50–50, and since that is the reality, they need a profit target that is much larger than their risk to have any chance at making money. But in a 50–50 market, the profit target always pretty much equals the risk, and therefore, at best, their system will lose at least commissions and not make money.\nMost traders should look for trades where they can make a swing profit. When the Emini has an average daily range of about 10 to 15 points, a trader can usually risk about two points on a trade, and a swing trade is any trade where the profit is four points or more. Although the probability of success is usually only 40 to 50 percent for most of these trades, this type of trading gives most traders the best chance of making a living as a trader. There are usually about five setups a day, and traders will likely have to place at least three trades a day to make sure that they each catch at least one big winner. If they are patient and disciplined, they will be about breakeven on the trades that do not result in four or more points of profit. Some of those trades will be one- to three-point winners, while others will be one- to two-point losers. However, they need the four-point winners to make the system profitable. A trader who wants to take more trades a day will have to be willing to accept a smaller profit target, like two points, because there are rarely five to 10 trades in a day where a trader can make four points. However, there are usually that many trades where a skilled trader can make two points while risking two points. These traders, then, need to be right at least 60 percent of the time to be profitable.\nThis is more difficult, but it is a reasonable goal for traders who are particularly good at reading price action.\nIn actual trading, most successful traders have routines and do not have to think about the math when they place trades.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 180, "text_raw": "If AAPL broke below a trading range that is $3.00 high and there is support around $3.00 below, which is also the area of the measured move\nbased on the height of the range, you can look to buy about $3.00 down from the breakout for a $3.00 rally that will test the breakout. If the move\ndown is a strong $2.00 or $3.00 spike that will likely have follow-through in the form of a bear channel, you should not buy on a limit order and should\ninstead wait either for a second entry to go long or for a pullback that you can short. However, if the sell-off below the trading range has two or three\nstrong bull trend bars, lots of overlapping bars with tails, and two or three clear legs down, you can consider buying on a limit order $3.00 down and\nrisking $3.00, since the odds of a test up to the breakout $3.00 above are probably at least 60 percent. If there is a second-entry buy setup and the\nsignal bar is only 30 cents tall and its low is $3.00 below the breakout point, then you are risking only 32 cents and you have about a 60 percent\nchance of gaining $2.70 on a rally back up to the bottom of the trading range.\nDIRECTIONAL PROBABILITY\nTraders always want to find trades where they will probably make money. However, there is another type of probability that can help traders in their\ntrade selection. At every moment, there is a probability attached to the direction of the next tick. Will it be higher or lower? For most of the day, the\nprobability hovers around 50 percent, which means that the chance that the next tick will be higher is the same as the chance that it will be lower.\nThis is the current directional probability of an equidistant move where the size of that move is one tick. In fact, the directional probability of an\nequidistant move of any size up versus down hovers around 50 percent for most of the day. So there is usually close to a 50 percent chance that the\nmarket will go up 10 ticks before it falls 10 ticks and a 50 percent chance that it will fall 10 ticks before going up 10 ticks. The same is true for 20\nticks or 30 ticks. It does not matter, as long as the size of the move is not too large relative to the chart you are viewing; also, the smaller the size of\nthe move relative to the range over the recent five to 10 bars, the more accurate is the probability. Obviously, if you are looking at a stock trading at\n$10, the directional probability of a $20 move down is meaningless, because there is a zero probability that you will lose $20. However, with\nrespect to moves that are within a reasonable range based on the chart, all traders use directional probabilities on every trade, although most never\nthink of their trades in these terms. Traders might buy IBM in a pullback to the daily moving average because they believe that the odds favor a\n$5.00 rally before a $3.00 drop. By “the odds favor,” they mean that they believe that there is well over a 50 percent chance that they will achieve\ntheir goal, or else they would not take the trade. They most likely believe that the odds are 60 percent or better. If traders are extremely bullish, they\nmight believe that the odds are 70 percent that IBM will rally $10 before it falls $3.00, and if they are right, then they just made a great trade.\nThis last observation is important and correct. If IBM is in a wedge bull flag pullback at the moving average and at the bull trend line in a strong\nbull trend on the 5 minute chart, the directional probability of a 50 cent rally before a 50 cent sell-off might be 60 percent, but the odds of a $1.00\nrally before that 50 cent sell-off might be only slightly less, like maybe 57 percent, and this gives traders a great edge and explains why entering on\npullbacks is such a good strategy.\nSimilarly, if someone trades Eminis and is buying a strong reversal up off a long-term (maybe 50 to 200 bars) bull trend line after a final bear flag\nin a bear swing, this trader might believe that the odds are 60–40 that the market will rally four points to his profit-taking limit order before it falls 2\npoints to his protective stop. If the trader takes this trade 10 times, he nets four points six times for 24 points and loses two points four times for\neight points, and the overall profit is 16 points, or 1.6 points per trade. This is a good average for a day trade where the risk is two points. One of\nthe most common causes of losses is a failure to give enough thought to the mathematical basis for a trade.\nAlmost all traders should only take trades where the reward is at least as large as the risk, and the directional probability of an equidistant move\n(a move where the reward is the same size as the risk) is a good thing to consider before taking any trade. Is it likely that I will make at least as\nmuch as I stand to lose? In other words, is there a 60 percent chance or better of making two points on a buy setup in the Emini while using a two-\npoint protective stop? Is there a 60 percent chance of making 1.00 by shorting AAPL when using a 1.00 protective stop? If yes, then the trade has a\npositive trader's equation and therefore is a reasonable trade. If not, then don't take the trade. Although there are many combinations of risk,\nreward, and probability that can result in a positive trader's equation, thinking in terms of the directional probability of an equidistant move is a\ngood, quick way to help decide whether you should take a trade. When trading, things happen fast and are often unclear, so it is useful to have a\nlogical framework that can reliably help you decide within the limited time that the market will give you. If you can answer “yes” to the question, then\nyou can take the trade. You may end up wanting to hold for a reward that is greater than the risk, but the minimum starting point always should be a\nreward that is equal to the risk. If you can look at any setup and quickly believe that the setup is good, then you likely believe that the probability of\nmaking a profit that is at least as big as your risk is 60 percent, and therefore the trade has a positive trader's equation and is a reasonable trade.\nWhen the directional probability of an equidistant move hovers around 50 percent, this means that if IBM is trading at $100 and you don't look at\na chart and are totally oblivious of the fundamentals and the overall market, and you simply bought 100 shares of IBM and then placed a one\ncancels the other (OCO) order to exit either at $101 on a sell limit order or at $99 on a sell stop, whichever came first, you would have about a 50\npercent chance of making a dollar and a 50 percent chance of losing a dollar. If instead you initially shorted the 100 shares and also used an OCO\n$1.00 bracket order (buying on a limit $1.00 below or buying on a stop $1.00 above), you would still have about a 50 percent chance of making a\ndollar and a 50 percent chance of losing a dollar. There are slightly better odds for the rally because IBM is a growing company. If it goes up about\n8 percent a year, this comes out to about three and a half cents a day and only negligibly raises the odds in favor of the upside target, so it is still\nabout a 50–50 bet.\nYou can make money buying or shorting, even when the directional probability of an equidistant move is 50 percent, by scaling into or out of your\ntrade (discussed in Chapter 31). You can also make money when the directional probability of a large move in your favor is around 50 percent if\nthat move is sufficiently bigger than your risk. You can make money even when the directional probability of an equidistant move is less than 50\npercent if the amount that you stand to gain on your trade is big enough. For example, if you buy near the top of a trading range, the directional\nprobability of the market rallying 10 ticks before falling 10 ticks might be only 30 percent (remember, most attempts to break out of a trading range\nfail). Suppose that a successful breakout would rally to a magnet 60 ticks higher and you are risking only 10 ticks on a trade with only a 30 percent\nchance of success; if you take this trade 10 times, you will expect to make 60 ticks on three trades for 180 ticks of profit and lose 10 ticks on seven\ntrades for a 70-tick loss. Your net profit would be 110 ticks, or 11 ticks per trade.\nThe easiest situation for most traders is to look for setups where the directional probability of an equidistant move is above 50 percent, and most\ntraders should focus on finding these fleeting setups. They are fleeting because the market will quickly recognize the imbalance, and the price will\nmove fast to bring the market back to neutrality. The imbalance exists at every moment that the market is trending and when the market is at the top\nor bottom of a trading range, and these are times when there is an edge that most traders can see and use to trade profitably. For example, say\nyou short a low 2 on a pullback to the moving average in a strong bear trend; just before you enter, the market is near the top of a small trading\nrange (every pullback is a small trading range) and has about a 60 percent directional probability of an equidistant move going down rather than up.\nLet's say that the signal bar is six ticks tall, that you enter on a stop one tick below its low, and that your protective stop is one tick above the bar so\n", "text_clean": "If AAPL broke below a trading range that is $3.00 high and there is support around $3.00 below, which is also the area of the measured move based on the height of the range, you can look to buy about $3.00 down from the breakout for a $3.00 rally that will test the breakout. If the move down is a strong $2.00 or $3.00 spike that will likely have follow-through in the form of a bear channel, you should not buy on a limit order and should instead wait either for a second entry to go long or for a pullback that you can short. However, if the sell-off below the trading range has two or three strong bull trend bars, lots of overlapping bars with tails, and two or three clear legs down, you can consider buying on a limit order $3.00 down and risking $3.00, since the odds of a test up to the breakout $3.00 above are probably at least 60 percent. If there is a second-entry buy setup and the signal bar is only 30 cents tall and its low is $3.00 below the breakout point, then you are risking only 32 cents and you have about a 60 percent chance of gaining $2.70 on a rally back up to the bottom of the trading range.\nDIRECTIONAL PROBABILITY\nTraders always want to find trades where they will probably make money. However, there is another type of probability that can help traders in their trade selection. At every moment, there is a probability attached to the direction of the next tick. Will it be higher or lower? For most of the day, the probability hovers around 50 percent, which means that the chance that the next tick will be higher is the same as the chance that it will be lower.\nThis is the current directional probability of an equidistant move where the size of that move is one tick. In fact, the directional probability of an equidistant move of any size up versus down hovers around 50 percent for most of the day. So there is usually close to a 50 percent chance that the market will go up 10 ticks before it falls 10 ticks and a 50 percent chance that it will fall 10 ticks before going up 10 ticks. The same is true for 20 ticks or 30 ticks. It does not matter, as long as the size of the move is not too large relative to the chart you are viewing; also, the smaller the size of the move relative to the range over the recent five to 10 bars, the more accurate is the probability. Obviously, if you are looking at a stock trading at $10, the directional probability of a $20 move down is meaningless, because there is a zero probability that you will lose $20. However, with respect to moves that are within a reasonable range based on the chart, all traders use directional probabilities on every trade, although most never think of their trades in these terms. Traders might buy IBM in a pullback to the daily moving average because they believe that the odds favor a $5.00 rally before a $3.00 drop. By “the odds favor,” they mean that they believe that there is well over a 50 percent chance that they will achieve their goal, or else they would not take the trade. They most likely believe that the odds are 60 percent or better. If traders are extremely bullish, they might believe that the odds are 70 percent that IBM will rally $10 before it falls $3.00, and if they are right, then they just made a great trade.\nThis last observation is important and correct. If IBM is in a wedge bull flag pullback at the moving average and at the bull trend line in a strong bull trend on the 5 minute chart, the directional probability of a 50 cent rally before a 50 cent sell-off might be 60 percent, but the odds of a $1.00 rally before that 50 cent sell-off might be only slightly less, like maybe 57 percent, and this gives traders a great edge and explains why entering on pullbacks is such a good strategy.\nSimilarly, if someone trades Eminis and is buying a strong reversal up off a long-term (maybe 50 to 200 bars) bull trend line after a final bear flag in a bear swing, this trader might believe that the odds are 60–40 that the market will rally four points to his profit-taking limit order before it falls 2 points to his protective stop. If the trader takes this trade 10 times, he nets four points six times for 24 points and loses two points four times for eight points, and the overall profit is 16 points, or 1.6 points per trade. This is a good average for a day trade where the risk is two points. One of the most common causes of losses is a failure to give enough thought to the mathematical basis for a trade.\nAlmost all traders should only take trades where the reward is at least as large as the risk, and the directional probability of an equidistant move (a move where the reward is the same size as the risk) is a good thing to consider before taking any trade. Is it likely that I will make at least as much as I stand to lose? In other words, is there a 60 percent chance or better of making two points on a buy setup in the Emini while using a twopoint protective stop? Is there a 60 percent chance of making 1.00 by shorting AAPL when using a 1.00 protective stop? If yes, then the trade has a positive trader's equation and therefore is a reasonable trade. If not, then don't take the trade. Although there are many combinations of risk, reward, and probability that can result in a positive trader's equation, thinking in terms of the directional probability of an equidistant move is a good, quick way to help decide whether you should take a trade.

If instead you initially shorted the 100 shares and also used an OCO $1.00 bracket order (buying on a limit $1.00 below or buying on a stop $1.00 above), you would still have about a 50 percent chance of making a dollar and a 50 percent chance of losing a dollar. There are slightly better odds for the rally because IBM is a growing company. If it goes up about 8 percent a year, this comes out to about three and a half cents a day and only negligibly raises the odds in favor of the upside target, so it is still about a 50–50 bet.\nYou can make money buying or shorting, even when the directional probability of an equidistant move is 50 percent, by scaling into or out of your trade (discussed in Chapter 31). You can also make money when the directional probability of a large move in your favor is around 50 percent if that move is sufficiently bigger than your risk. You can make money even when the directional probability of an equidistant move is less than 50 percent if the amount that you stand to gain on your trade is big enough. For example, if you buy near the top of a trading range, the directional probability of the market rallying 10 ticks before falling 10 ticks might be only 30 percent (remember, most attempts to break out of a trading range fail). Suppose that a successful breakout would rally to a magnet 60 ticks higher and you are risking only 10 ticks on a trade with only a 30 percent chance of success; if you take this trade 10 times, you will expect to make 60 ticks on three trades for 180 ticks of profit and lose 10 ticks on seven trades for a 70-tick loss. Your net profit would be 110 ticks, or 11 ticks per trade.\nThe easiest situation for most traders is to look for setups where the directional probability of an equidistant move is above 50 percent, and most traders should focus on finding these fleeting setups. They are fleeting because the market will quickly recognize the imbalance, and the price will move fast to bring the market back to neutrality. The imbalance exists at every moment that the market is trending and when the market is at the top or bottom of a trading range, and these are times when there is an edge that most traders can see and use to trade profitably. For example, say you short a low 2 on a pullback to the moving average in a strong bear trend; just before you enter, the market is near the top of a small trading range (every pullback is a small trading range) and has about a 60 percent directional probability of an equidistant move going down rather than up.\nLet's say that the signal bar is six ticks tall, that you enter on a stop one tick below its low, and that your protective stop is one tick above the bar so", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["If AAPL broke below a trading range that is $3.00 high and there is support around $3.00 below, which is also the area of the measured move", "based on the height of the range, you can look to buy about $3.00 down from the breakout for a $3.00 rally that will test the breakout.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 181, "text_raw": "your total risk is eight ticks. During this breakout, the directional probability of the market falling eight ticks to your profit target (if that is where your\ntarget is) before it hits your protective stop might be 70 percent or higher. This means that there is a 70 percent chance of you making eight ticks\nbefore you lose eight ticks. If you do this on 10 trades, you will expect to make 56 ticks and lose 24 ticks and will net 32 ticks, or 3.2 ticks of profit\nper trade, which is acceptable for a scalper.\nHow does this help traders who are starting out? It gives them a logical basis for deciding which trades to take. They should always begin by\nassessing risk. If the signal bar is 48 cents tall in AAPL, then the initial risk is 50 cents if they enter on a stop at one tick above the high of the bar\nand have a stop at one tick below. If they are trading the Emini and the bar is six ticks tall, the stop will be eight ticks from the entry price, and they\nshould use a profit target that is at least eight ticks away. Beginners should never enter a trade with the expectation of making less than they are\nrisking, so they would then assume that their reward is at least 50 cents in that AAPL trade (or eight ticks for that Emini trade). They are looking for\nan equidistant move (the stop and profit target are both 50 cents from the entry price). Finally, they look at the setup. If they think that it looks good,\nusing any definition of good, they should assume that the chance of the market filling the profit-taking limit order before hitting the protective stop is\nat least 60 percent. As long as they are reasonably good at reading charts, their opinion that the setup looks good means that they think it is more\nlikely than not to lead to a profitable trade. If it is good enough for them to hold that belief, it has to be more than 50 percent certain. If it is only 55\npercent certain, they would likely not be confident. If they are confident, then they likely believe that it is at least 60 percent certain. They might\nsometimes be 58 percent certain and at other times be 80 percent, but their average level of certainty will be at least 60 percent, and they can\ntherefore use 60 percent when evaluating the trader's equation. Since their probability is at least 60 percent and their potential reward is at least as\nlarge as their risk, the trader's equation is positive and they can take the trade. They know that they might lose as much as 50 cents in up to 40\npercent of the trades (they will exit some trades early on a trailing stop with less than a 50 cent loss), but their average profit will be greater than\nzero. Because they are using 60 percent instead of 50 percent, they will still likely be positive, even after slippage and commissions are\nconsidered.\nEven though a trading range is characterized by uncertainty, which means that both the bulls and the bears are actively trading because they both\nbelieve there is value at their entry price, the directional probability of an equidistant move can briefly be much higher that 50 percent as the market\ntests the extremes. For example, suppose the 5 minute chart of IBM has been in a trading range that is $1.00 tall, and the top and bottom of the\nrange have been repeatedly tested so that the range is well defined; if you buy above a small bull reversal bar at the bottom of the range, the\ndirectional probability of a 50 cent move up before a 50 cent move down is likely 60 percent or higher, and it may briefly increase to 70 percent if\nthere is a sharp move up after you enter. As the rally moves toward the middle of the range, the directional probability quickly falls back to 50\npercent, but where that exact middle is cannot be known in advance. The market usually has to overshoot it for traders to decide that it clearly has\ngone too far. The market takes a long time to home in on that 50 percent price, but it is quick to recognize when a swing has gone too far. This\nprice will be at some resistance area and will become the top of the trading range. Once the traders have decided that the directional probability\nnow clearly favors the bears, the market is likely at the top of the trading range. As IBM gets close to the top of the range, the probability of a move\n50 cents higher before there is a 50 cent pullback might fall to 40 percent, meaning that the 50 cent move down is now more likely (in fact, it has a\n60 percent probability if the chance of the move up occurring first is 40 percent). IBM will then move down and it will often overshoot the area of\nneutrality to the point that it clearly went too far and swing up and down in search of uncertainty and a neutral directional probability. This process of\nup and down moves continues until the bulls and the bears agree on an area of value. At that point the swings become small and a tight trading\nrange or the apex of a triangle form, and this will ultimately be in the middle of the trading range. Once the bulls and the bears perceive that the\nvalue is bad for one side, the market will break out and trend again until it finds a new area of value.\nWhen a trading range is very tight, like 20 cents in IBM, it does not matter if the directional probability briefly jumps to 70 percent if you stand to\ngain only 10 cents while risking 10 cents, because slippage and commissions then become important. This is a bad scalp. If they amount to 4\ncents, then your 10 cent gain is actually only a 6 cent net gain. Even if the odds are 60 percent in your favor, if you take this trade 10 times, you will\nmake 36 cents and lose 40 cents. Since you can never be certain of the probability, and high probabilities last only briefly, you will lose money if you\ntake that trade. Only HFT firms can consistently make money in this situation because their infrastructure allows them to quickly place profitable\ntrades with the objective of only a one-tick profit.\nA tight trading range can sometimes offer a great swing trading opportunity based on mathematics if the breakout is likely to lead to a large\nmove. A tight trading range is a breakout mode situation, and the breakout will usually lead to a move that is several times the height of the range.\nSince the odds of the breakout in either direction are about 50–50, depending on the circumstances, what happens if you buy within a couple of\nticks of the bottom of the range and risk about five ticks, or if you short within a couple of ticks of the top of the range and risk about five ticks? If you\nhold for the breakout and use a profit target that is 15 to 20 ticks, you are risking five ticks to make 20 ticks and have a 50 percent chance of\nsuccess. This is a great theoretical trade because if you take it 10 times, you will make 20 ticks on five trades and lose five ticks on five trades and\nhave a net profit of 75 ticks, or 7.5 ticks per trade. However, most traders cannot handle the stress of holding a 50–50 trade for a long time,\nwatching the market repeatedly go in their direction, only to reverse and go against them.\nIf you look at a Market Profile of a trading range, you will see that there is very little time spent at the top and bottom of the range, where the high\nprobabilities exist, which means that you have to watch intensely for a long time and then act quickly when the market tests the top or bottom of the\nrange, and this is much more difficult to do than it sounds. When the market tests the top of the range, it usually does so with one or more strong bull\ntrend bars and they have enough momentum to make you consider the possibility that the breakout might succeed. Also, the reversal down is often\nwith a large signal bar, so your entry is close to the middle of the range, where the directional probability is close to 50 percent.\nWhen the market is testing the top or bottom of the range and threatening to break out, the probability of a reversal might be 60 percent or higher,\nbut if a breakout occurs, the directional probably of a move of X ticks up or down changes rapidly over the next several bars. If the breakout bar is\nnot too large and it stalls at a trend channel line and other resistance area, the directional probability of a failed breakout and a reversal might\nbriefly increase to 65 percent. If the next bar is a strong reversal bar, that probability might become 70 percent. This means that the trader has an\nedge, but edges are always fleeting and usually fairly small. As soon as traders believe that there is a 60 percent or better certainty about the near-\nterm direction, everyone enters, the market quickly moves back to an area of uncertainty, and the edge disappears. When you believe there is an\nedge, there is an opportunity and you have to enter quickly before it evaporates.\nHowever, if the breakout bar looks strong, the chance of a reversal might drop to 50 percent; and if there is strong follow-through over the next\ncouple of bars, then the directional probability of a reversal can fall to 30 percent, meaning that the directional probability of a move of X ticks in the\ndirection of the spike compared to one in the opposite direction would be 70 percent. So if there is a three-bar spike up in AAPL that is breaking\nout of a bull flag and the spike is currently $2.00 tall, there is a 70 percent chance that AAPL will rally $2.00 more before it falls $2.00 to the bottom\nof the spike. If the spike grows to $4.00, then the probability of a further rally of $4.00 before the bottom of the spike is hit still is at least 60 percent.\nThe trader who bought when the spike was only $2.00 tall now has $2.00 in profit, is risking $2.00 to the bottom of the spike, and has a 60 percent\n", "text_clean": "your total risk is eight ticks.

That is why it is so important to enter as soon as you are confident that there is a strong directional\nprobability in your favor (in other words, once there is a clear always-in position) and you believe that it will continue in your favor for several more\nbars.\nThis is one of the most important ways to make money as a trader. It is stressful to make these decisions in real time when you are looking at a\nchart where the past five breakout attempts have failed and now you are faced with one that looks like it might succeed. Also, you might be lulled\ninto complacency, and the inertia of doing nothing makes it difficult to quickly change into the mind-set of having to act quickly and aggressively.\nHowever, if you can train yourself to do this, you will be in a position to take one of the most profitable types of trades. Remember, edges are\nfleeting. Everyone sees them and the market works quickly to neutralize them, so you have to be fast. If you are finding it difficult to take these\ntrades, then trade a very small size.

You are terrified for those first few seconds and you tense up every muscle in your body and squeeze your eyes, hold your breath, and\npinch your nose. But within seconds, the move is over and you feel safe. When you take these emotional breakout trades, the situation is similar,\nbut you must learn to jump and trust that soon everything will be okay and you will be able to tighten your stop. Within a few bars, you might have a\n40 cent open profit and a breakeven stop and you will have made your best trade of the day.\nHow can you trust that the directional probability of an equidistant move in a strong spike is actually 60 percent or more? Go back to that AAPL\nbull breakout. Once AAPL has a strong $2.00 bull spike after a very strong buy signal, the institutions are buying as the spike is growing. You can\nsee that the pullbacks are small as the bar is forming. If it closes on its high and the market begins to form another bull trend bar and then another,\nthe institutions on the buy side are much stronger than on the sell side, and the market will likely have more follow-through. If that initial $2.00 bull\nspike looked strong enough for you to conclude that the always-in position was now long, then you should conclude that the directional probability of\nan equidistant move is at least 60 percent. This is because the institutions believe that the initial stop is below the spike and most spikes continue\nfor at least a measured move. If the spike is $2.00 tall, they are risking $2.00 to make $2.00 and they cannot do that profitably if the odds are only\n50–50. They almost certainly would not take the trade unless they had some room for error, and that means that the probability of them making\n$2.00 instead of losing $2.00 is at least 60 percent. Would you take the trade if you thought that the probability was less than 60 percent? Probably\nnot, and you should conclude that they feel the same way.\nOne of the benefits of entering early in a trend is that once the trend goes your way, the math greatly improves for your trade. If the spike grows to\n$3.00, your risk is still $2.00, but the odds of a measured move up before the bottom of the spike is tested are still at least 60–40. If the spike then\ngrows to $4.00, there is still at least a 60 percent chance that AAPL will go up $4.00 more before it falls to below the bottom of the spike. At this\npoint, you have $2.00 in profit and are still risking just $2.00, but the odds of the market going up $4.00 more are at least 60 percent. This means\nthat you now have a 60 percent chance of making a total of $6.00 while just risking $2.00. At this point, you probably have already taken a partial\nprofit and might have moved your protective stop to breakeven. This is why it is so important to enter a trend early, even if that means entering\nduring the spike phase and not waiting for a pullback. This is what the institutions are doing, and so should you.\nAlthough the math is different every day and in every market and on every time frame and it is impossible to know it in advance, on most charts\nmost trades will have between a 40 percent and a 60 percent chance of success. The word most is also vague and it means about 90 percent of\nthe time. This can be confusing, but it is important to your success. If you were to buy or sell for any reason at any time, you would have a 90 percent\ncertainty that the chances of making a certain number of points are about the same as the chances of losing the same number of points. However,\nthat other 10 percent of the time is critical because if you are confident that the market is not in that 40 percent to 60 percent band, then you have an\nedge. For example, if AAPL is in a strong spike down on the 5 minute chart, the chances of making $1.00 on your short before losing $1.00 might\nbe 70 percent or more. The better you become at understanding price action, the better you will be at spotting brief imbalances like this. They come\nevery day, on every chart, and on every time frame, but the keys are to learn to spot them and to patiently wait for them. Once you become\nproficient, you are in a position to make money as a trader.\nThe directional probability cannot stay far above 50 percent for long because there has to be an institution on the other side and it will quickly\nrealize that its trader's equation is negative and change its position. During a strong spike, there is a high level of directional certainty. For example,\nif AAPL has a strong three-bar bull spike of $3.00 on the 5 minute chart, the probability of the market moving up $3.00 more before falling $3.00\nmay be 60 percent or higher. Once the spike ends and the channel begins, the probability slowly erodes as the market approaches its measured\nmove target or whatever resistance level is exerting a magnetic pull on the market. En route to its target, the directional probability falls to about 50\npercent, but once it gets to the target, the directional probability overshoots 50 percent and now actually favors a move down. Why is that? Because\nthe market usually has to go too far before traders realize that it has overshot neutrality. The market is good at knowing when it has gone too far, but\nnot very good at knowing when it has gone far enough. Traders are uncertain when the market is actually in the middle of the developing range, and\nthey do not become certain that it is at the top of the range until that is clearly the case. The top of the channel is the start of the move down and the\ntop of an incipient trading range. Whenever the market is at the top of a trading range, the directional probability of an equidistant move favors a\nsell-off, since most breakout attempts fail and reverse back down into the range. Therefore, the probability of a down move is maybe 60 percent,\nand once the market drops down into the middle of the developing trading range, the directional probability of an equidistant move again returns to\nabout 50 percent. If the trend up was very strong, the odds probably favor an up move slightly when the market is in the middle of the range, and if\nthe market drifts down to the bottom of the channel, the odds of an up move increase further, since the market is then at the bottom of a trading\nrange where a downside breakout is unlikely.\nThe market often oscillates above and below the middle of the range as it tries to find neutrality and uncertainty. This is where both the bulls and\nthe bears feel there is value for new positions. However, at some point one side will decide that there is no longer value there, and far fewer traders\nwill take positions at this price in that direction. The market will then trend until it finds a new price where both the bulls and the bears feel there is\nvalue, which will be in another trading range.\nOnce the market initially reaches the top of the channel, if it is $3.00 above the bottom, the market now has about a 60 percent chance of falling\n$3.00 to the bottom of the channel before rising $3.00 more. You could choose any number, like $2.00 or $1.00; it does not matter, as long as it is\nnot too large for the chart on the screen. The market has about a 60 percent chance of falling $1.00 before rising $1.00 and vice versa. The bottom\nof the channel is a magnet that usually gets tested and it is $3.00 below. Since the pullback to test the bottom of the channel usually has far less\nmomentum than the spike that preceded the channel, the directional probability of the move up after a test of the bottom of the channel will be less\nthan when the market was in the spike, and it might be comparable to that of the bull channel. If the slope of the correction down is shallow, the\ndirectional probability of an equidistant move at the bottom of the pullback (and therefore the bottom of the developing trading range) favors the\nbulls and may be 60 percent. You can never know for sure, but the leg down is some kind of trend, just like the channel up was a weak trend, and\nwhenever there is a trend, the directional probability of it continuing is above 50 percent until it has gone too far. Once the pullback has reached a\n", "text_clean": "chance of making an additional $4.00. That is why it is so important to enter as soon as you are confident that there is a strong directional probability in your favor (in other words, once there is a clear always-in position) and you believe that it will continue in your favor for several more bars.\nThis is one of the most important ways to make money as a trader. It is stressful to make these decisions in real time when you are looking at a chart where the past five breakout attempts have failed and now you are faced with one that looks like it might succeed. Also, you might be lulled into complacency, and the inertia of doing nothing makes it difficult to quickly change into the mind-set of having to act quickly and aggressively.\nHowever, if you can train yourself to do this, you will be in a position to take one of the most profitable types of trades. Remember, edges are fleeting. Everyone sees them and the market works quickly to neutralize them, so you have to be fast. If you are finding it difficult to take these trades, then trade a very small size. For example, if you normally like to trade 500 SPY shares and risk 20 cents but the size of the breakout spike would require you to risk 40 cents, simply buy 100 shares at the market and place that 40 cent protective stop. This is like diving off of a very high diving board. You are terrified for those first few seconds and you tense up every muscle in your body and squeeze your eyes, hold your breath, and pinch your nose. But within seconds, the move is over and you feel safe. When you take these emotional breakout trades, the situation is similar, but you must learn to jump and trust that soon everything will be okay and you will be able to tighten your stop. Within a few bars, you might have a 40 cent open profit and a breakeven stop and you will have made your best trade of the day.\nHow can you trust that the directional probability of an equidistant move in a strong spike is actually 60 percent or more? Go back to that AAPL bull breakout. Once AAPL has a strong $2.00 bull spike after a very strong buy signal, the institutions are buying as the spike is growing. You can see that the pullbacks are small as the bar is forming. If it closes on its high and the market begins to form another bull trend bar and then another, the institutions on the buy side are much stronger than on the sell side, and the market will likely have more follow-through. If that initial $2.00 bull spike looked strong enough for you to conclude that the always-in position was now long, then you should conclude that the directional probability of an equidistant move is at least 60 percent.

Probably not, and you should conclude that they feel the same way.\nOne of the benefits of entering early in a trend is that once the trend goes your way, the math greatly improves for your trade. If the spike grows to $3.00, your risk is still $2.00, but the odds of a measured move up before the bottom of the spike is tested are still at least 60–40. If the spike then grows to $4.00, there is still at least a 60 percent chance that AAPL will go up $4.00 more before it falls to below the bottom of the spike. At this point, you have $2.00 in profit and are still risking just $2.00, but the odds of the market going up $4.00 more are at least 60 percent. This means that you now have a 60 percent chance of making a total of $6.00 while just risking $2.00. At this point, you probably have already taken a partial profit and might have moved your protective stop to breakeven. This is why it is so important to enter a trend early, even if that means entering during the spike phase and not waiting for a pullback. This is what the institutions are doing, and so should you.\nAlthough the math is different every day and in every market and on every time frame and it is impossible to know it in advance, on most charts most trades will have between a 40 percent and a 60 percent chance of success.

If the support appears weak,\nthe probability is less, but still greater than 50 percent for a bounce up. For example, there might be a 56 percent chance of AAPL rallying one\ndollar before falling one more dollar.\nIn any case, when the probability is close to 50 percent, your reward has to be greater than your risk for you to take a trade. If your risk is the\nsame as your reward, the trade is theoretically breakeven if you execute it perfectly and ignore commissions. Since you can do neither, the system\nwill lose money. For example, if your profit target is $1.00 and you increase your stop to any size, say $2.00, you will lose money if the probability of\na $1.00 move up is the same as a $1.00 move down. Why is that? Let's say that you do this four times. In two of the times you do this, your $1.00\nprofit-taking limit order will be filled. However, in the other two trades, the market will fall $1.00 before hitting your $1.00 profit target. Now that it is\ndown a dollar, the probability is still 50 percent that it will move up $1.00 before moving down another $1.00 and hitting your $2.00 stop. This means\nthat in one of four trades you lose $2.00 and in two of four you make $1.00. That remaining trade is when the market falls about a dollar but then\nrallies back to breakeven. At that point, the process begins again and you have a 50 percent chance of making $1.00 and a 25 percent chance of\nlosing $2.00. You can do the iterations an infinite number of times and you will come up with the same result, and that is that you are twice as likely\nto make $1.00 as you are to lose $2.00. This means that the expected net profit is zero. Once you subtract commissions and some money for\nhuman error, you will conclude that it is a money-losing approach. You can use even larger stops and repeat the math, but the result will be the\nsame.\nWhy does a measured move target often work so precisely? Because it is the minimum needed by institutions to have a positive trader's\nequation, and they would not otherwise take the trade. Since they are profitable, the basket of all of their trades has a positive trader's equation,\nwhich means that, for the average dollar that they trade, the minimum move has to be at least a measured move. Alternatively, the probability has to\nbe much greater than 60 percent, which is unlikely. The result is that many trades hit a target exactly because many firms will take profits there,\nknowing that if they do, they are doing the minimum necessary to make the basket of their trades profitable. Most targets fail because they are the\nminimum, and when a market is strong, firms will hold well beyond the target before taking profits.\nThere is one final point about the mathematics of trading, and I will take it from the mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, and that is that\nmuch of life is not what it seems. In fact, Dodgson is not what he seemed to be and is better known as Lewis Carroll. We work in an Alice in\nWonderland world where nothing is really as it seems. Up is not always up, and down is not always down. Just look at most strong breakouts of\ntrading ranges—they usually fail and up is really the start of down and down is really just part of up. Also, 60 percent is 60 percent in only 90 percent\nof the cases and can be 90 percent sometimes and 10 percent at other times. If a good setup is 60 percent, how can you win 80 percent or more of\nthe time? Well, in a pullback in a strong trend just above support, a setup might work 60 percent of the time; but if you use a wider stop or if you can\nscale in as the market goes lower, especially if your subsequent entry is larger, you might find that you win in 80 percent or more of those 60\npercent setups. Since 80 percent of trend reversal attempts fail and become simply pullbacks, these pullbacks often have an 80 percent chance of\na profitable trade in the direction of the trend. Also, if you use a very wide stop and are willing to sit through a large drawdown for a couple of hours,\nthat 60 percent chance of making two points before losing two points in the Emini might be a 90 percent chance of making four points before losing\neight points. If you are flexible and comfortable with constantly changing probabilities and many probabilities coexisting, your chance of success is\nmuch greater.\nFigure 25.1 As a Spike Grows, So Does the Profit Target\nThe profit potential increases as the size of the spike increases. Although some traders think of spikes as beginning at the high of the first bar of\nthe spike and ending at the low of the final bar of the spike, it is usually more reliable to look only at the bodies of the bars instead of the tails. If a\nmeasured move down goes beyond one based on the open of the first bar to the close of the last bar, then traders should look at how the market\nbehaves at a measured move based on the high of the first bar to the low of the last bar.\nIn the chart on the left in Figure 25.1, when the spike was just a single bear trend bar that had a body that was five ticks tall, the projected target\nfor the move down was five ticks below the close of that bar. In the chart on the right, the spike had grown to four bars, and the open of the first bar\nwas 19 ticks above the close of the final bar. The projected target was then 19 ticks below the close of the final bar. If you bought early on as the\nspike was just forming, even though your risk remained constant since your stop stayed at one tick above the high of the first bar of the spike, your\npotential reward increased as the measured move target continued to fall. You could reduce your risk to breakeven after the market had one or two\nlarge bear trend bars, or even move your protective stop to just above the high of one of those bars. If you did, you would be locking in at least a\nsmall profit while still being in a good position to make a large profit.\nFigure 25.2 Look for Brief Moments of Higher Probability\n", "text_clean": "support level, the directional probability once again rises to about 60 percent for the opposite direction (a move up).

Since 80 percent of trend reversal attempts fail and become simply pullbacks, these pullbacks often have an 80 percent chance of a profitable trade in the direction of the trend. Also, if you use a very wide stop and are willing to sit through a large drawdown for a couple of hours, that 60 percent chance of making two points before losing two points in the Emini might be a 90 percent chance of making four points before losing eight points. If you are flexible and comfortable with constantly changing probabilities and many probabilities coexisting, your chance of success is much greater.\nFigure 25.1 As a Spike Grows, So Does the Profit Target The profit potential increases as the size of the spike increases. Although some traders think of spikes as beginning at the high of the first bar of the spike and ending at the low of the final bar of the spike, it is usually more reliable to look only at the bodies of the bars instead of the tails. If a measured move down goes beyond one based on the open of the first bar to the close of the last bar, then traders should look at how the market behaves at a measured move based on the high of the first bar to the low of the last bar.\nIn the chart on the left in Figure 25.1, when the spike was just a single bear trend bar that had a body that was five ticks tall, the projected target for the move down was five ticks below the close of that bar. In the chart on the right, the spike had grown to four bars, and the open of the first bar was 19 ticks above the close of the final bar. The projected target was then 19 ticks below the close of the final bar. If you bought early on as the spike was just forming, even though your risk remained constant since your stop stayed at one tick above the high of the first bar of the spike, your potential reward increased as the measured move target continued to fall. You could reduce your risk to breakeven after the market had one or two large bear trend bars, or even move your protective stop to just above the high of one of those bars. If you did, you would be locking in at least a small profit while still being in a good position to make a large profit.\nFigure 25.2 Look for Brief Moments of Higher Probability", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["support level, the directional probability once again rises to about 60 percent for the opposite direction (a move up).

After the\nrepeated bull reversal bars at bars 15, 16, 17, the bar after bar 19, and bar 20, the probability may have been as high as 70 percent. The bears\nmade repeated attempts to push the market below yesterday's close and were failing. Each of these attempts represented buying pressure, which\nwas cumulative. Once it reached a critical mass, the bulls would take over. After the first three or four bottom attempts, you could buy on a limit\norder at four points below bar 9, risk four points, and have an OCO limit order to take profits four points higher.\nShorting below bar 14 had only about a 50 percent chance of leading to a good swing trade, because it was in a tight trading range where the\nprobability of a swing in either direction was only about 50 percent.

The trading\nrange of the first half of the day was about half of the size of an average daily range. When a breakout occurs after the first hour or two, the market\nusually reaches about a measured move down and then bounces as it begins to form a lower trading range. Traders who understood this were\nmore confident about buying between bars 16 and 20, and many traders were buying on limit orders at or below the most recent swing lows. That is\nwhy there were so many bars with tails down there. For example, after the bounce up at bar 19, aggressive traders placed limit or market orders to\nbuy at, just below, or just above the bar 19 low. They went long at bar 20 and held for a test of the bottom to the upper trading range at the bar 9 low.\nMany would have used a protective stop that was about the same number of ticks as there were in the average recent bar.\nOnce the market began to develop strong bull bars from bar 16 to the bar before bar 18, the buying pressure was strong enough for traders to\nexpect a test of the breakout below bar 9. They saw the space between the most recent tick and the bar 9 low as a gap and expected it to fill. It\ncame to within three ticks on bar 18, but traders usually expect a test to come to within two ticks or less. With the market having had as much buying\npressure as it had today, most traders believed that the market would trade above the bar 9 low. Some bought on limit orders at about a measured\nmove down from the bar 9 low, based on the height of the trading range from the bar 9 low to the bar 11 high (it was about four points). Others\nbegan to buy below the low of the prior bar or below prior lows, like when the market fell below the bar 19 low. These traders might have used a risk\nequal to their reward, expecting about a 60 percent chance of success.\nHad the bear breakout been very strong, traders would have done the opposite. They would have shorted in the area of the bottom of the bear\nspike and risked to above the spike, believing that there was about a 60 percent chance of reaching a reward equal to their risk. For example,\nsome shorted around the bar 15 close and expected about a 60 percent chance of making as many ticks as they had to risk (one tick above the\nbar 14 high down to their entry price, or about four points). Once the market began to develop buying pressure several ticks above their profit-\ntaking limit orders, they no longer saw their premise as valid. Even though they tightened their protective stops, they were not willing to risk two to\nthree points to make that remaining point in the face of the buying pressure; they began to buy back their shorts, adding to the buying pressure.\nSince these bears just exited on a short trade that ended up weaker than they had expected, they would not have been willing to short again until\nafter several more bars up. They would have considered shorting only at higher prices, like maybe at the bar 9 low, if there was a reasonable sell\nsetup. At that point, the market was in a tight bull channel and likely to go higher, so not enough bears shorted there to turn the market down, and\nthis led to the tight bull channel up to bar 23, where the market was vacuumed up to test the bar 12 low.\nA scalper needs high probability trades to have a positive trader's equation, because his reward is often about the same size as his risk.\nHowever, some trends will have a series of weak buy setups at the top of bull channels (or weak sell setups at the bottom of bear channels) and\ntherefore low probabilities of success.

Swing traders, on the other hand, can be comfortable with setups that have a chance of success that is only 40 percent or less\nwhen the reward is many times larger than the risk.\nSeveral of the setups in the move down from bar 18 probably did not have a 60 percent chance of success in the eyes of a lot of scalpers, and\nthose scalpers would have missed most of the huge bear trend. Many would have chosen to trade little or not at all in the two hours between bars 18\nand 25. Swing traders could have shorted below the bar 18 moving average gap bar, the bar 21 two-bar reversal and lower high, or the bar 28\ndouble top lower high and bear flag, and made more than enough points to offset their relatively low probability of success. They could have added\non below bar 31, even though it had a bull body and was the entry bar for a wedge long (bars 13, 25, and the small doji before bar 31 were the three\npushes down). It was the first pullback in a six-bar bear micro channel in a bear trend, and it had a prominent tail on the top, increasing the chances\nthat the market would trade down. The probability of the swing was still relatively low, but the potential reward was very large, because the market\nmight have been breaking below a wedge bottom and could fall for about a measured move down, which it did.\nMost scalpers would not have shorted below bar 18 because it had a bull body and was in a tight bull channel. Although the next bar had a bear\nbody and therefore created a two-bar reversal, it had a prominent tail, making it a lower probability signal, especially after a strong rally that was in\na tight bull channel.\nAlthough bar 21 was a lower high, at that point in the day, most traders were looking for a second leg up after the strong bar 13 sell climax, so\nmany scalpers would have been hesitant to short below the bottom of a triangle (bars 16 and 20 were the first two pushes down, and the doji bar\nafter bar 21 might have become the third) or trading range, which is always a relatively low probability trade.\nBar 22 was a breakout pullback short but it followed a small doji, which might have been the start of the second leg up, so many scalpers would\nnot have shorted at the bottom of what could have soon been the bottom of the second leg up.\nAll of the bear bars from bar 23 to bar 25 had prominent tails, which meant that traders were buying at the lows of the bars, and therefore the\nchannel was weak. Scalpers don't like to short at the bottom of a weak bear channel.\nThe move up from the possible bar 25 lower low and bottom of the parabolic channel (after the three-bar bear spike down to bar 13, and the\nsmaller spikes at bar 20 and two bars after bar 21) to bar 26 had four bull bodies, including a large bull trend bar. It was strong enough for many\ntraders to see the market as having flipped to always in long, and be inclined to look for long setups, not shorts. Bar 27 was a strong bull reversal\nbar and two-legged higher low. The odds favored more sideways or up trading. Bar 28 had a bull body and was therefore not a strong sell signal\nbar. The next bar had a bear body and therefore created a two-bar reversal, but its low was far enough below the bar 28 low to make scalpers\nunwilling to short because there was too much risk of a double bottom with the bar 27 low.\nOnce the market had the strong breakout down to bar 29, scalpers might have shorted its close, or the close of the next bar, which confirmed the\nalways-in flip to down.\nBar 31 was a breakout pullback, but had a bull body and prominent tails, which made scalpers suspect that the market might be entering a small\ntrading range. The probability was great enough to make many not short below its low, but some would have. They also might have shorted as it\nmoved above the doji bar and on the close, once they saw the large tail on the top, signifying selling pressure.

Swing traders could have shorted below the bar 18 moving average gap bar, the bar 21 two-bar reversal and lower high, or the bar 28 double top lower high and bear flag, and made more than enough points to offset their relatively low probability of success. They could have added on below bar 31, even though it had a bull body and was the entry bar for a wedge long (bars 13, 25, and the small doji before bar 31 were the three pushes down). It was the first pullback in a six-bar bear micro channel in a bear trend, and it had a prominent tail on the top, increasing the chances that the market would trade down. The probability of the swing was still relatively low, but the potential reward was very large, because the market might have been breaking below a wedge bottom and could fall for about a measured move down, which it did.\nMost scalpers would not have shorted below bar 18 because it had a bull body and was in a tight bull channel. Although the next bar had a bear body and therefore created a two-bar reversal, it had a prominent tail, making it a lower probability signal, especially after a strong rally that was in a tight bull channel.\nAlthough bar 21 was a lower high, at that point in the day, most traders were looking for a second leg up after the strong bar 13 sell climax, so many scalpers would have been hesitant to short below the bottom of a triangle (bars 16 and 20 were the first two pushes down, and the doji bar after bar 21 might have become the third) or trading range, which is always a relatively low probability trade.\nBar 22 was a breakout pullback short but it followed a small doji, which might have been the start of the second leg up, so many scalpers would not have shorted at the bottom of what could have soon been the bottom of the second leg up.\nAll of the bear bars from bar 23 to bar 25 had prominent tails, which meant that traders were buying at the lows of the bars, and therefore the channel was weak. Scalpers don't like to short at the bottom of a weak bear channel.\nThe move up from the possible bar 25 lower low and bottom of the parabolic channel (after the three-bar bear spike down to bar 13, and the smaller spikes at bar 20 and two bars after bar 21) to bar 26 had four bull bodies, including a large bull trend bar. It was strong enough for many traders to see the market as having flipped to always in long, and be inclined to look for long setups, not shorts. Bar 27 was a strong bull reversal bar and two-legged higher low. The odds favored more sideways or up trading. Bar 28 had a bull body and was therefore not a strong sell signal bar. The next bar had a bear body and therefore created a two-bar reversal, but its low was far enough below the bar 28 low to make scalpers unwilling to short because there was too much risk of a double bottom with the bar 27 low.\nOnce the market had the strong breakout down to bar 29, scalpers might have shorted its close, or the close of the next bar, which confirmed the always-in flip to down.\nBar 31 was a breakout pullback, but had a bull body and prominent tails, which made scalpers suspect that the market might be entering a small trading range. The probability was great enough to make many not short below its low, but some would have. They also might have shorted as it moved above the doji bar and on the close, once they saw the large tail on the top, signifying selling pressure. With all of the difficult setups for scalpers, especially for shorting after the bar 18 high, there were still plenty of high probability opportunities for them to make money. They could have shorted below bars 2, 4, 6, 12, and maybe 21 (some would not have taken this short), and they could have shorted the closes of the bar after bar 6, the bar after bar 12, bar 29, bar 30, bar 31 and the bar after, and on limit orders above bar 1, bar 17, the bar after bar 20, the bar before bar 22, and the bar after bar 30.

In general, it is always more reliable to short below a strong bear bar.\nBar 2 was a high 2 following a large inside doji bar, but the down momentum was strong.

This was a two-bar reversal that\noverlapped at least one other bar, and the signal bar was large, forcing traders to short at the bottom of the trading range.

You\ncould also have shorted at the market on the first 5 minute close above the moving average and used about a 20 cent stop. Here, at bars 1 and 2\non the 5 minute chart, the market went only 4 cents above the close before reversing down. In general, it is better either to wait for the second 1\nminute entry or to use the traditional 5 minute price action entry (on a stop below the bar that tests the exponential moving average), because there\nis very little gained by the other methods and they just involve more thought, which can distract you from your primary trading on a higher time frame\nchart, like the 5 minute.\nFigure 26.5 When a Channel Is Tight, Wait for a Second Signal\n", "text_clean": "As shown in Figure 26.3, bar 1 was a second-entry short following a test of yesterday's high.

In Figure 26.4, the 5 minute chart is the smaller chart, and the moving average on the 1 minute chart is the 5 minute moving average, but plotted on the 1 minute chart. At bars 1 and 2 in AAPL, a second entry off the 1 minute chart at the 5 minute moving average had about a 25 cent risk, and the price action entry off the 5 minute chart (insert) had about a 45 cent risk. You could also have shorted at the market on the first 5 minute close above the moving average and used about a 20 cent stop. Here, at bars 1 and 2 on the 5 minute chart, the market went only 4 cents above the close before reversing down. In general, it is better either to wait for the second 1 minute entry or to use the traditional 5 minute price action entry (on a stop below the bar that tests the exponential moving average), because there is very little gained by the other methods and they just involve more thought, which can distract you from your primary trading on a higher time frame chart, like the 5 minute.\nFigure 26.5 When a Channel Is Tight, Wait for a Second Signal", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["As shown in Figure 26.3, bar 1 was a second-entry short following a test of yesterday's high.

They will\nbuy around the close of every bear trend bar, even if the bar is large and closes on its low. They will buy as the market falls below the low of the prior\nbar, any prior swing low, and any support level, like a trend line. They also will buy every attempt by the market to go higher, like around the high of a\nbull trend bar or as the market moves above the high of the prior bar or above a resistance level. This is the exact opposite of what traders do in\nstrong bear markets, when they sell above and below bars, and above and below both resistance and support. They sell above bars (and around\nevery type of resistance), including strong bull trend bars, because they see each move up as an attempt to reverse the trend, and most trend\nreversal attempts fail. They sell below bars (and around every type of support), because they see each move down as an attempt to resume the\nbear trend, and expect that most will succeed.\nA market order is just a type of limit order where a trader is eager to get in or out of a trade and does not worry about saving a tick or two. Many\ntraders who want to trade at the market just place a limit order on their price ladder, so many limit order trades are actually with the intent of entering\nor exiting at the market. For example, if the QQQ is at $51.10 and in a bull spike, traders who want to get long at the market will often hit a buy limit\nprice on their price ladder that is above the offer, like at $51.14, and get filled at the market. Because of this, most of what I write about limit orders\nis applicable to market orders for traders who prefer to use market orders.\nSomething very important happens every time the market moves above the high or below the low of the prior bar. The market is breaking out of\nthe range of the prior bar, but it is very important to realize that most attempts to break out fail. Unfortunately, beginning traders get caught up in the\nemotion of all breakouts and assume that the market is at the start of a big move. They don't understand that the breakout is a test. The market is\nsearching for value, and the breakout is simply a contest between the bulls and the bears, and usually not the start of a big trend. The market runs\nthis test every bar or two on every chart and in every time frame. A trader who used stop orders to buy above the high of every bar and short below\nthe low of every bar would be taking every breakout and would lose money. Why? Because a stop entry is a breakout trade, and most breakouts\nfail. The market usually gets pulled back into the trading range, such as the body of the prior bar, and then decides where it will go next. Although\nstop entries and exits are the best choice for traders starting out, they have to be selective.\nLet's say that the current bar just rallied to one tick above the high of the prior bar. Most individual traders would either do nothing, buy on a stop\nat one tick above the high of the prior bar, or sell on a limit order at the high of the prior bar. If the breakout is successful and the market runs far\nenough up for bulls to make their profits, then they made the right decision. However, if the move above the prior bar was just a buy vacuum, the\nmarket will soon turn down, and the bears will make a profit. If the trend is down, then many bears will wait for rallies to sell, and a favorite setup is a\nrally above anything, like a bear trend line, a prior swing high, or even simply the high of the prior bar. If there are enough strong bears waiting to\nshort until the market moves above something, then this buy vacuum could easily lead to a one- or two-tick breakout above the high of the prior bar.\nInstead of the market finding a lot of strong bulls up there, it will find lots of strong bears who were waiting for the market to get just a little higher, like\nabove the prior bar, before shorting.\nThe opposite is true for the bulls in an uptrend.

They will buy around the close of every bear trend bar, even if the bar is large and closes on its low. They will buy as the market falls below the low of the prior bar, any prior swing low, and any support level, like a trend line. They also will buy every attempt by the market to go higher, like around the high of a bull trend bar or as the market moves above the high of the prior bar or above a resistance level. This is the exact opposite of what traders do in strong bear markets, when they sell above and below bars, and above and below both resistance and support. They sell above bars (and around every type of resistance), including strong bull trend bars, because they see each move up as an attempt to reverse the trend, and most trend reversal attempts fail. They sell below bars (and around every type of support), because they see each move down as an attempt to resume the bear trend, and expect that most will succeed.\nA market order is just a type of limit order where a trader is eager to get in or out of a trade and does not worry about saving a tick or two. Many traders who want to trade at the market just place a limit order on their price ladder, so many limit order trades are actually with the intent of entering or exiting at the market. For example, if the QQQ is at $51.10 and in a bull spike, traders who want to get long at the market will often hit a buy limit price on their price ladder that is above the offer, like at $51.14, and get filled at the market. Because of this, most of what I write about limit orders is applicable to market orders for traders who prefer to use market orders.\nSomething very important happens every time the market moves above the high or below the low of the prior bar. The market is breaking out of the range of the prior bar, but it is very important to realize that most attempts to break out fail. Unfortunately, beginning traders get caught up in the emotion of all breakouts and assume that the market is at the start of a big move. They don't understand that the breakout is a test. The market is searching for value, and the breakout is simply a contest between the bulls and the bears, and usually not the start of a big trend. The market runs this test every bar or two on every chart and in every time frame. A trader who used stop orders to buy above the high of every bar and short below the low of every bar would be taking every breakout and would lose money. Why? Because a stop entry is a breakout trade, and most breakouts fail. The market usually gets pulled back into the trading range, such as the body of the prior bar, and then decides where it will go next. Although stop entries and exits are the best choice for traders starting out, they have to be selective.\nLet's say that the current bar just rallied to one tick above the high of the prior bar. Most individual traders would either do nothing, buy on a stop at one tick above the high of the prior bar, or sell on a limit order at the high of the prior bar. If the breakout is successful and the market runs far enough up for bulls to make their profits, then they made the right decision. However, if the move above the prior bar was just a buy vacuum, the market will soon turn down, and the bears will make a profit. If the trend is down, then many bears will wait for rallies to sell, and a favorite setup is a rally above anything, like a bear trend line, a prior swing high, or even simply the high of the prior bar. If there are enough strong bears waiting to short until the market moves above something, then this buy vacuum could easily lead to a one- or two-tick breakout above the high of the prior bar.\nInstead of the market finding a lot of strong bulls up there, it will find lots of strong bears who were waiting for the market to get just a little higher, like above the prior bar, before shorting.\nThe opposite is true for the bulls in an uptrend. They want to buy pullbacks, and if enough strong bulls believe that the bears will be able to push the market below the low of the current bar, why should they buy before that happens when they can soon buy lower?

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 194, "text_raw": "a limit order to buy at the low of the prior bar, and wait for the bears to push the market below the low of the current bar. That sell vacuum sucks the\nprice down into their buy zone, and they buy aggressively, trapping the bears who will soon have to buy back their shorts (adding fuel to the rally),\nand the market quickly reverses up.\nMost of the time, the probability for either buying on the stop above the prior bar or shorting on a limit order at the high of the prior bar is about 50\npercent, but it is often 60 percent or more in favor of the stop or the limit order. With experience, traders can spot these 60 percent situations and\nplace their orders in the direction that has the edge. Since most breakout attempts fail, successful limit order entries tend to be more reliable, but\nthey are much harder to take because you are betting that a move will fail and reverse in your direction before hitting your protective stop. Until\ntraders have a lot of experience, it is very stressful to wait for the market to reverse and go their way. Just as blindly entering on every stop signal is\na losing strategy, blindly fading every one of those signals with a limit order in the opposite direction is also a losing strategy. On any given day,\nthere might be about 10 reasonable stop entry setups and 20 or more limit order setups, although many are not obvious to inexperienced traders.\nBecause there are so many reliable limit order setups, it is important for traders to be able to evaluate them.\nWhen you are trying to enter on a limit order, you are trying to get in at a better price than the current price. For example, if you are looking to buy\non a limit order, your order is below the current price and you need the price to fall for your order to get filled. Entering on stops is a safer approach\nin general because the market is moving in your direction as you enter, and the odds of follow-through are greater. For beginners, this is the best\napproach. However, there are many situations in which you can enter on a limit order instead of a stop. In fact, as mentioned, there are usually\nabout twice as many limit order setups as there are stop entry setups, but they are riskier and usually harder to take because they are counter to at\nleast the short-term trend. For example, if you just bought a second-entry setup in a pullback following a breakout above a bear trend line and a\nstrong bull reversal bar, and the market tests the exact low of the entry bar a couple of times over the next one or two bars, consider placing a limit\nbuy order to double your position at one tick above the low of the entry bar and risk just two ticks (to the original stop, just below the entry bar). You\nwould likely not get filled if you tried to buy the low of the entry bar on a limit order, since the market usually has to trade through the limit price for the\norder to get filled. Everyone knows that there are many protective stops just one tick below that entry bar low—why isn't the smart money gunning for\nit? It is because if those stops are hit, the character of the market will have changed. Instead of being a strong second entry, the chart now has a\nfailed second entry, and that is a with-trend setup and will likely result in two further legs down. If the smart money traders had loaded up on the\nbottom, they would not want to see the market drop for another two legs, so they will do exactly as you did: they will continue to accumulate longs to\ndefend the bottom. Eventually, sellers will give up and start to cover, and as they do, the market will rise well beyond the scalper's target.\nEntering on a limit order is trading countertrend to at least the short-term trend and, in general, can create needless anxiety that can interfere with\nyour ability to trade later in the day. A strong spike alone is not a reason to begin to look to enter on a pullback using a limit order. For example, if\nthere is a strong bull spike in the Emini to the top of a trading range or a possible buy climax at the end of a bull trend, traders might see it as a sign\nof strength and place limit orders to scale into longs at maybe one to four points lower. However, they need to consider the possibility that the bull\nspike was an exhaustive buy climax. When there is any doubt, a trader should not be buying on limit orders as the market is falling, because the\nsell-off might last for at least 10 bars and two legs, and it could be the start of a reversal down. A strong bull spike alone is not enough of a reason\nto buy a pullback on a limit order; traders need to consider the context of the bull spike. The opposite is true of bear spikes.\nFurthermore, if the market rallied for a couple of hours but has now sold off for an hour with no sign of a bottom and you place a limit order to buy\na Fibonacci 62 percent pullback or at a Bollinger, Keltner, or any other type of band, the market will be falling when you enter your long and you will\ntherefore be trading against the current trend, hoping that the earlier trend will return. The market often bounces in the area of a 62 percent pullback,\nbut not often enough or far enough to make it worthwhile compared to entering on a stop. If the market reverses up around that 62 percent\nretracement, just wait for the bar to close and look to see if it has a bullish close. If so, place an order to buy at one tick above its high. Then the\nmarket will be moving in your direction when you enter and the bulls will have demonstrated strength both by the bullish close and by their ability to\npush the market above the high of the prior bar. And you still have the 62 percent pullback in your favor. If the trade is good, it is now much more\nlikely to be successful. Yes, you might miss a couple of ticks by waiting for the entry on a stop, but you will be avoiding far more losers and a lot of\nneedless stress.\nThere are a few instances when entering on a limit order results in a winning percentage comparable to a good stop order entry. If for some\nreason you missed entering what appeared to be a great trade on a stop and within seconds you are able to place a limit order at the stop price or\na tick or two worse, this can be effective. However, use it only for very strong trades because, in general, you do not want to be in a trade that let you\nin at a great price once you have already missed the original entry. Great trades rarely come back to bail out less astute traders.\nIn a strong bull trend, you cannot be looking to short a low 1 or a low 2, especially when the signal bar is weak. When there is a pause bar or a\nweak bear bar, many traders will step aside and wait until the market trades below that bar to buy. This creates a mini sell vacuum. Buying at or\nbelow the low of that bar is often a good trade with the expectation of a high 1 or high 2 trigger several ticks higher. Other traders will buy at fixed\nintervals below the high of the spike, like one or two points down, and this often coincides with the low of those low 1 and low 2 signal bars.\nRemember, in a strong bull trend, low 1 and low 2 signals do not exist and are only traps. Tops in strong bull trends become bull flags in about 80\npercent of the cases. The opposite is true in strong bear trends, where shorting at or above the highs of high 1 and high 2 signal bars is often a\ngood strategy.\nIf you are taking a reversal entry, especially in a trading range, there are frequently pullbacks along the way, often within a bar or two of entering. If\nyou are confident in your reading of the price action, you can fade those pullbacks. These are usually low or high 1 or 2 setups that you believe will\nfail. For example, if there is a wedge bottom on a trading range day and you buy the reversal up, you can expect the low of the wedge to hold. You\nbelieve that the trend is now up, so you want to buy pullbacks. A pullback can be as small as a single bar. Since there will probably be two legs up,\nthe first leg down should not go far. That low 1 short should fail and become a pullback in the new bull leg because the trend for the next 10 or more\nbars has reversed to up. The only time that a low 1 short is reliable is in the spike phase of a strong bear trend, and never after a reversal pattern.\nThat low 1 short entry will likely fail to fall below the low of the wedge and will instead form a small higher low in the two-legged correction up.\nBecause of that, you can place a limit order to buy at the low or one to three ticks below the low of that short signal bar, expecting a small higher low\nto form instead of a profitable low 1 short. You usually can risk as few as four ticks in the Emini.\nAs the reversal up continues, you might think that a low 2 short setup could form. However, since you believe that the trend has reversed into a\nbull trend, you expect that low 2 to fail as well and be followed by higher prices. You are still in the buy pullbacks mode, and that can include a small\npullback, like a low 2. Here again you can place a limit order to buy at or below the low of the low 2 signal bar and risk about four ticks in the Emini.\nYou are expecting this bear flag to fail to break out more than a few ticks, and instead to continue to work up into a bull channel. This is a type of\nfinal flag because it is the final flag of the bear trend. The bears thought of it as a bear flag, but when they are not able to break it below the bear\nsignal bar by more than a tick or two, the flag will continue to grow up and to the right until traders realize that it has become a bull channel. At some\npoint, when enough traders realize what is happening, the bears will cover and there will usually be an upside breakout and then a measured move\n", "text_clean": "a limit order to buy at the low of the prior bar, and wait for the bears to push the market below the low of the current bar.

Once the bears believe that either the market has reached the top of a trading range or the bull trend is in the process of reversing down, they\nwill look for high 1 and high 2 signal bars and place limit orders to short at or just above the highs of those bars. They are looking to sell rallies, even\nvery small ones like a high 1 or a high 2. Bulls will look to buy low 1 and low 2 entries at the bottom of a trading range, and at the bottom of a bear\ntrend when they feel that the market is in the process of reversing into a bull swing.\nAs discussed in the chapter on trend reversals in the third book, most tops are some form of double top and involve a failed high 1, high 2, or\ntriangle breakout, and that high 1, high 2, or triangle then becomes the final bull flag in the rally. When the leg up and top are small, the double top is\na micro double top. When traders are anticipating a reversal, they will place sell limit orders at and above the signal bar for the bull flag, expecting it\nto fail. A bottom usually comes from a failed low 1, low 2, or triangle breakout, creating the final flag in the bear leg. When the double bottom forms\nover only a few bars, it is a micro double bottom. Traders expecting the flag to fail and lead to a reversal up will place limit orders to buy at and\nbelow the low of the sell signal bar.\nGoing back to that wedge bottom, if it ends with a large bull reversal bar and then there is a second strong bull trend bar with small tails, the odds\nof a two-legged rally are good. If the next bar is a small bull bar or a doji bar, then this is a weak setup for a low 1 short in any circumstance, and\nafter a possible wedge bottom, it is especially likely to not lead to a profitable short. At a minimum, bears should wait for at least a low 2, but if the\ntrend has reversed, that will also likely fail. Smart bulls will see the weak low 1 setup and expect it to fail to yield a scalper's profit for the shorts; they\nwill place a limit order to buy at the low of the bar or maybe a few ticks lower, and risk maybe six ticks in the Emini. Traders do this in all markets all\nthe time, and the locations of the limit order and protective stop depend on the market. For example, suppose the average daily range in Google\n(GOOG) has been $10 lately; if there is a reversal up from a bear wedge on the 5 minute chart and those first few bars extend $3 off the low, a\ntrader might place a limit order to buy about 50 percent down at maybe $1.50 below the top of the first leg and maybe 50 cents or even a dollar\nbelow the low 1 signal bar, and then risk another $1.50 or $2.00, or to below the low of the wedge.\nEntering on limit orders can also be effective in some barbwire patterns and in small trading ranges, where the bars are large and mostly\noverlapping and the pattern is largely horizontal. This is risky and requires quick decision making, and only the best and most experienced traders\nshould attempt it.\nTraders routinely fade all types of channels with limit and market orders, shorting at the top and reversing to long at the bottom. The safest\nchannel is a trading range with clearly defined support and resistance that has been tested several times. Since false breakouts are common,\ntraders who fade a test of the extremes by shorting at the resistance line above or buying at the support line below put their protective stops far\nenough beyond the line to allow for a failed breakout before the market reverses in their direction and tests the opposite side of the range. Traders\ndo this in trend channels as well. For example, if there is a bull trend channel, they will short at the market or with a limit order when the market\ntouches or gets close to the trend channel line, and they will short above the most recent swing high in the channel and scale in as the market goes\nhigher. This is not a good strategy for the final couple of hours of the day because you will too often run out of time and have to cover a large short\nposition for a loss.\nBulls will buy at the market or with a limit order on a test of the trend line at the bottom of the channel, and they will place a protective stop far\nenough below the line to allow for a small overshoot of the line. They will also buy with a limit order at or below the low of the prior bar. Since they\nare trading with the trend, they are more likely to swing their positions up and add on at subsequent setups. In a bull channel, you should not be\nlooking for low 1, 2, 3, or 4 setups, because those are setups only in bear trends and trading ranges. If you see one in a bull trend, since the odds\nare that it will fail and hit the protective buy stop above, it makes more sense to take the opposite trade. Instead of looking to short below the low of\nthe prior bar, place a limit order to buy at or below that bar. You will be buying where those bears will be shorting, and since they will likely lose, you\nwill likely win.\nIf there are broader swings within the channel, like in a trending channel or stairs pattern, there is even stronger two-sided trading, so fading the\ntop and bottom of the channel are even more reliable trades. All channel fading is especially reliable if a trader trades a small enough size to be\nable to scale in if the market goes further against the initial entry. For example, if the market is in a bear channel, you can buy on a limit order below\neach prior swing low and look to add on a little lower, using a wide stop. If the market reaches your profit target after the first entry, you take your\nprofit. If instead the trend continues and your second limit order is also filled, you can exit both positions at the entry price of your first entry. You will\nthen get out of your first entry at around breakeven and out of your second entry with a profit. There is one important caveat for traders who scale\ninto countertrend trades, and that is that you should exit or reverse to the with-trend direction on the second move against you. This means that if\nyou are scaling into shorts in a bull trend, exit or even reverse to long on a high 2, especially if it is near the moving average. Similarly, when scaling\ninto longs in a bear trend and it sets up a low 2, especially if it is near the moving average, exit or even reverse to short if the low 2 triggers.\nA scalper in the Eminis usually needs a six-tick move beyond the signal bar to scalp four ticks of profit. This is because the entry stop is one tick\nbeyond the bar, and then you need four more ticks for your profit, and your profit target limit order usually won't get filled unless the market moves\none tick beyond your order. Sometimes your order will get filled without the market moving through it, but when that happens, the market is usually\nstrong and will likely move beyond that price within a few minutes of your fill. Similarly, to scalp 10 ticks in the QQQ, you usually need a 12-tick\nmove.\nWhen a setup looks weak, it is best to not take it and to wait for another opportunity. If it is weak, it will likely fail, and you should not take needless\nrisk. Often a weak setup will have a second entry, in which case it becomes a strong setup.\nTraders can also enter on limit orders on pullbacks to breakout areas if they believe that the breakout was strong and they expect that test to be\nsuccessful. Breakout tests exist to see if traders will enter again where they entered earlier. For example, if the 5 minute Emini reversed up with a\nstrong bull reversal bar after a final flag in a bear swing and the rally lasted for a couple of hours, it is common for the market to test down to within a\ntick or two of the high of that bull signal bar. Traders bought aggressively above that bar, and now the market is testing back down to that price\nlevel. If the bull trend is strong, buyers will return at that same price area and the bull swing will resume. Many institutions routinely have limit and\nmarket orders at that level, and it provides an excellent risk/reward ratio for traders. They might have to risk only four to six ticks and they might have\nbetter than a 50 percent chance of making four or more points. For examples, see Chapter 5 on failed breakouts, breakout pullbacks, and breakout\ntests.\nAlthough most trades should be entered on stops, when there is a strong trend it is safe to enter anytime, and entering at the moving average on\na limit order is particularly good in stocks, which tend to be well behaved. This allows for a smaller risk and greater potential reward and essentially\nno change in the winning percentage. In a bull trend, traders often risk to below the most recent higher low, so buying a pullback means that their\nprotective stop is smaller. Similarly, in a bear trend, traders often put their protective stops above the most recent lower high and short on pullbacks.\nFigure 28.1 Limit Order Entries\n", "text_clean": "up.

The move up to bar 3 was strong and the market was\npausing just below the moving average, which is a magnet. The market was close enough to be within the magnetic pull of the moving average.\nSince bar 3 was a doji and therefore a bad signal bar for a short after a strong up move, the market would likely not go down far before it pushed up\nagain to test the moving average. Aggressive bulls could have bought at or just below bar 3 with a limit order for a test of the moving average,\nmaybe risking six ticks.\nAfter the bar 5 test of the moving average, the market was likely to correct sideways to down. Astute traders saw that the bulls were unable to\ncreate consecutive strong bull trend bars. This increased their willingness to go short. Bar 5 was a bear bar test of the bottom of the moving\naverage. Since it was after a second buy climax (formed by the first and third bars of the day, which were large bull trend bars), two legs sideways\nto down were likely to follow. Therefore, shorting on a limit order at the bar 6 high or one tick above was a good risk/reward trade. Some bulls\nthought that a high 2 buy signal was likely so they placed limit orders to buy at and below the low of bar 5. However, given the two-sided nature of\nthe recent bars, this was a risky strategy. Other traders saw the bear close on bar 5 and anticipated a low 2 short signal at the moving average.\nJust after bar 5 closed, they shorted at the market or on a limit order at the close of bar 5.\nAs the market collapsed down from the moving average, traders shorted the closes of the three large trend bars, and they shorted on small\npullbacks as the bear bars were forming. For example, many had limit orders to short one, two, or three ticks above the most recent low.\nThe opening range from bar 1 to bar 5 was about half the size of an average day's range, so once the market broke below bar 1, some traders\nwould have looked at measured move targets for a possible low of the day. The bar 8 low was an exact measured move down from the open of bar\n1 to the high of bar 5. Traders knew that the open of the day at this point was in the exact middle of the day's range, and that the market might try to\ntest back up to the open before the close. This would create a doji bar on the daily chart with both the open and the close in the middle of the day. If\nthe market could rally back up to the high, the day would become a bull reversal day. Some bulls were willing to go long on a limit order at one tick\nabove the measured move target and then hold for a test of the open. The chance of a successful test of the open of the day was probably 30\npercent to 40 percent. They could have used a protective stop of maybe a couple of points, and then they could have waited to see what happened.\nSince the sell-off was losing momentum, the odds were good that there would be enough profit takers for the market to bounce before their\nprotective stops were hit. If the market fell below their entry price but did not hit their stops, they could have exited at breakeven if they felt that their\npremise was no longer valid. Once the market had the two-bar reversal up, they could have moved their protective stops to breakeven and then they\ncould have waited patiently to see if the rally developed, which it did.\nThe bear spike down to bar 8 had seven consecutive bear trend bars. Traders who saw this as a sign of strength might have placed limit orders\nto scale into shorts at maybe one to four points higher. However, they needed to consider the possibility that the bear spike was an exhaustive sell\nclimax. When there is any doubt, a trader should not be selling on limit orders as the market is rallying, because the rally might last for at least 10\nbars and two legs, and it could be the start of a reversal up, especially under the current circumstances. A strong bear spike alone is not enough of\na reason to sell a rally on a limit order. Traders have to look at the context of the bear spike.\nThe tight trading range at the low was a good example of how understanding the mathematics of trading can lead to a great trade. The range\nwas too tight to be scalping with stop entries. You cannot buy above a bar or short below a bar and expect to consistently make profitable scalps\nwhen the range is this tight. However, there is a great opportunity for swing traders. The day was a trending trading range day and if it broke above\nthe tight trading range, it would have had about a 70 percent chance of testing the bottom of the upper range at the bar 1 low. Once the double\nbottom bull flag was established by the move above bar 11, the bulls would defend its low. Therefore, buying one tick above it on a limit order and\nrisking one or two ticks below it was a good risk/reward trade. Your limit order would have been filled on bar 12, which retested the bars 10 and 11\ndouble bottom to the tick. You were risking about three ticks to make at least four points to the bar 1 low, or even about 12 points if the market\nreversed up and tested the high of the upper range, which it did. Since you were buying at the bottom of a tight trading range, you had a 60 percent\nchance of a test of the top of the range. However, you needed a successful upside breakout, and the chance of a breakout in either direction of a\ntight trading range is 50–50. So at the time of your purchase, you had a 50 percent chance of making four or more points while risking less than\none point. This was a great risk/reward trade, but only traders who understood the math would have been able to see it that way.\nOnce the market started forming higher lows at bars 13 and 14, you could have trailed your protective stop to one tick below the most recent\nhigher low. After the tests at bars 13 and 14 and then the breakout pullback at bar 16, the odds of at least a four-point move went up from maybe 50\npercent to 70 percent. At that point, you had locked in a couple of ticks of profit and had a 70 percent chance of making at least four points, and\nmaybe a 50 percent chance of the market going up to the top of the upper trading range. After the five bull trend bars started a breakout at bar 16,\nthe market had at least a 60 percent chance of reaching a measured move up because that is typical when there is a strong spike breakout. The\nmeasured move would be based on the open of the bar after bar 16 to the close of the third bar of the spike and adding that to the close of that third\nbar. The strongest bodies of a spike often lead to a measured move. This meant that you had a 60 percent chance of making about another five\npoints. You would have put your protective stop at the bottom of the spike, which would have protected about two points of your open profit.\nBar 17 was a bear reversal bar in a strong bull spike. Bulls expected that the market would form a successful high 1 buy setup after a one- or two-\nbar pullback. However, the high of that buy signal bar was likely to be higher than the low of the bar 17 sell signal bar, so aggressive bulls bought at\nthe low of bar 17. The bar after bar 17 was a bull bar and the trend up was strong. If the bar after it was a bear trend bar, and it was, it would set up\n", "text_clean": "The chart in Figure 28.1 shows several examples of good trades with limit order entries.

They could have used a protective stop of maybe a couple of points, and then they could have waited to see what happened.\nSince the sell-off was losing momentum, the odds were good that there would be enough profit takers for the market to bounce before their protective stops were hit. If the market fell below their entry price but did not hit their stops, they could have exited at breakeven if they felt that their premise was no longer valid. Once the market had the two-bar reversal up, they could have moved their protective stops to breakeven and then they could have waited patiently to see if the rally developed, which it did.\nThe bear spike down to bar 8 had seven consecutive bear trend bars. Traders who saw this as a sign of strength might have placed limit orders to scale into shorts at maybe one to four points higher. However, they needed to consider the possibility that the bear spike was an exhaustive sell climax. When there is any doubt, a trader should not be selling on limit orders as the market is rallying, because the rally might last for at least 10 bars and two legs, and it could be the start of a reversal up, especially under the current circumstances. A strong bear spike alone is not enough of a reason to sell a rally on a limit order. Traders have to look at the context of the bear spike.\nThe tight trading range at the low was a good example of how understanding the mathematics of trading can lead to a great trade. The range was too tight to be scalping with stop entries. You cannot buy above a bar or short below a bar and expect to consistently make profitable scalps when the range is this tight. However, there is a great opportunity for swing traders. The day was a trending trading range day and if it broke above the tight trading range, it would have had about a 70 percent chance of testing the bottom of the upper range at the bar 1 low. Once the double bottom bull flag was established by the move above bar 11, the bulls would defend its low. Therefore, buying one tick above it on a limit order and risking one or two ticks below it was a good risk/reward trade. Your limit order would have been filled on bar 12, which retested the bars 10 and 11 double bottom to the tick. You were risking about three ticks to make at least four points to the bar 1 low, or even about 12 points if the market reversed up and tested the high of the upper range, which it did. Since you were buying at the bottom of a tight trading range, you had a 60 percent chance of a test of the top of the range. However, you needed a successful upside breakout, and the chance of a breakout in either direction of a tight trading range is 50–50. So at the time of your purchase, you had a 50 percent chance of making four or more points while risking less than one point. This was a great risk/reward trade, but only traders who understood the math would have been able to see it that way.\nOnce the market started forming higher lows at bars 13 and 14, you could have trailed your protective stop to one tick below the most recent higher low. After the tests at bars 13 and 14 and then the breakout pullback at bar 16, the odds of at least a four-point move went up from maybe 50 percent to 70 percent. At that point, you had locked in a couple of ticks of profit and had a 70 percent chance of making at least four points, and maybe a 50 percent chance of the market going up to the top of the upper trading range. After the five bull trend bars started a breakout at bar 16, the market had at least a 60 percent chance of reaching a measured move up because that is typical when there is a strong spike breakout. The measured move would be based on the open of the bar after bar 16 to the close of the third bar of the spike and adding that to the close of that third bar. The strongest bodies of a spike often lead to a measured move. This meant that you had a 60 percent chance of making about another five points. You would have put your protective stop at the bottom of the spike, which would have protected about two points of your open profit.\nBar 17 was a bear reversal bar in a strong bull spike. Bulls expected that the market would form a successful high 1 buy setup after a one- or twobar pullback. However, the high of that buy signal bar was likely to be higher than the low of the bar 17 sell signal bar, so aggressive bulls bought at the low of bar 17.

In Figure 28.2, the sell-off down to bar 6 had signs of\nbuying pressure, like the bar 4 bull bar and the increasing size of the tails at the bottoms of the bars. This was therefore not a strong bear spike and\nconsequently the low 1 breakout to bar 7 was likely to fail. Since bar 6 was also at the bottom of a two-day expanding triangle and a poke below a\ntwo-week-long bull trend line, traders were looking for a dueling lines buy setup. Aggressive bulls bought during bar 7 as it broke below the iii\npattern, and more conservative traders bought above its high.\nMost traders saw the market as always-in long by the close of the bull breakout bar before bar 8 and were therefore looking to buy pullbacks.\nSince the move up to bar 8 was in a bull micro channel, they believed that the first breakout below the low of the prior bar would fail and become a\nbear trap, even though some traders saw it as a low 2 short near the moving average. These bulls would have placed buy limit orders to buy at and\nbelow the low of the prior bar, and they would have been filled on the bar after bar 8.\nSince the bar before bar 8 flipped the market to always-in long, bulls wanted the market to hold above the high of the bar before bar 8. Some\nplaced buy limit orders at one tick above the high of that bar, and they were filled on the doji bar after bar 8. Some would have risked just two ticks.\nOthers would have used a wider protective stop, and some would have added on lower. Even though the probability of success using a two-tick\nstop might have been only 30 to 40 percent, the potential reward was for a measured move up from this measuring gap, or at least a six-tick profit.\nThe realistic worst case was a six-tick profit and a 30 percent chance of success, which is a breakeven strategy, and the best case was maybe a\n60 percent chance of success and a 10- or 12-tick profit. This is an excellent result. Since the actual outcome was probably going to be somewhere\nin between and the math was therefore still good, this was a reasonable buy setup. The average daily range during this holiday trading was only\nabout five to six points. Since the market has only a few days a year with a range less than five points, today's range should have become at least\nthat large.\nThe move from bar 7 to bar 8 was a bull micro channel. Since the first breakout below a bull micro channel usually fails, bulls kept placing limit\norders to buy at the low of the previous bar. They were filled on the bar after bar 8.\nThe micro channel continued up to bar 9, and the bulls were filled again on the next bar as it fell below bar 9. Some would have risked four to\neight ticks on their longs, but others would have scaled in and bought more around four to six ticks below their first entry.\nAlthough bar 11 was a possible final flag short and a higher high, most traders assumed that the momentum up was strong enough so that a bear\nleg was unlikely. Either the market would continue up or it would go down just a little, form a trading range, and then go on to a new high. Because\nthe odds favored higher prices, they were willing to buy on limit orders at and below the low of the prior bar and were filled below bars 11 and 12.\nThe two-bar bear spike down from bar 14 might have flipped the market to always-in short for some traders, but most would have wanted to see\nstrong follow-through selling on the next bar to confirm the breakout to the downside. Once they saw the doji close on the next bar instead of a\nstrong bear close, they bought with limit orders around that close.\nThe market was likely to test the bar 10 bottom of the bull channel that followed the bar 7 to bar 9 bull spike. After that, a small trading range was\nlikely as the market decided on its next move. Bears were shorting on the move up from bar 15 with a stop at one tick above the top of the bar 14\nbear spike. Astute bears placed limit orders to short at one tick below the bar 14 high, with protective stops two ticks higher. They were filled on bar\n17. Since their risk was only two ticks and they were shorting in a trading range, the chance of success for an equidistant move was at least 50\npercent, and the chance of a four-tick move down before their two-tick stop was hit was probably also more than 50 percent. Since this was a\ntrading range on a small day, these bears were in scalp mode and were happy to go for a one-point, four-tick profit. Their potential reward was\ntwice the size of their risk and the probability was at least 50 percent, so the trader's equation was strong.\nBy bar 21, traders saw this as a trading range day and they expected breakout attempts to fail. Even though the strong bear spike after bar 22\nwas impressive, without follow-through selling and a bear close on the next bar it was likely to be a bear trap instead of a spike leading to a\nchannel. Aggressive traders bought its close and also went long on a limit order at its low. They also saw that bar 23 was a test of the open of the\nday and of the original long above bar 7. They might have risked about four ticks for a swing trade up. Even if the probability was only 30 to 40\npercent, the potential reward might have been four or five times the risk and therefore worth considering.

This was a sign\nof urgency going into the close, and alert bulls would have also placed stop orders to go long above that bear bar because it was a breakout\npullback buy setup. Many would not have been fast enough and would have chased the market up during the next bar, buying one- or two-tick\npullbacks with limit orders as the bar was forming.\nAs the market was rallying up to bar 13, the trend was clearly up. Some traders placed limit orders to buy a Fibonacci 62 percent pullback, or any\npullback of around 60 to 70 percent, with a stop below the bar 6 bull low. They were looking to buy where the reward would be about two or more\ntimes greater than the risk. Buying about two-thirds down for a test of the bull high was risking about one-third, making their target twice as large as\ntheir risk, which is always good. At the time they placed their orders, the trend was up, so buying a pullback had at least a 60 percent probability of\nan equidistant move (a move up equal to the size of their stop), and possibly a 60 percent chance of a new bull high (a reward twice as large as\ntheir risk). Entering on pullbacks to reduce risk is an approach used by many traders and has a strong trader's equation.\nFigure 28.3 Limit Order Setups\nThis 60 minute chart of the SPY presented in Figure 28.3 shows many examples where institutions and traders almost certainly entered on limit or\nmarket orders. Bar 3 was a climactic bottom of a bear channel, which was a bull flag, and a possible expanding triangle bottom. Bar 1 was the\nsecond push down, and the swing low that preceded it was the first. After the bar 3 low, traders were so confident that the market was going higher\non the leg down to bar 5 that they bought at the market and limit orders above the bar 4 low. Whenever a double bottom bull flag looks like this, it is\nbecause the bulls are so afraid of missing the new trend that they put their orders many ticks above the bar 4 low rather than at it or one tick above\nit. This led to a spike up to bar 6 and then a channel to bar 8. A trader could also have entered with a limit order in that area, risking about a point to\nbelow the bar 4 low and holding for a test of the tops of trading ranges in the channel at 105, 108, and maybe even 110. Each of these was the start\nof a channel down after a bear spike, and they were magnets. Traders were risking one point to make three to seven points and the probability was\nat least 40 percent, which made this a logical trade. Alternatively, they could have entered on a stop above the high of bar 5. This increased the\nprobability of success to about 60 percent because they were then buying a confirmed bottom of a trading range (a double bottom). Their risk was\nto below the signal bar, which was about one point, and their first profit target was two points higher, again making for a sound strategy.\nBar 6 was the top of a strong bull spike and therefore the chance of any pullback being followed by a higher high was about 70 percent. Many\ntraders therefore bought below its low. Other traders bought one tick above the bar 7 high 1 on a stop. When the market tested that price area\nagain, they bought some at bar 9 but were not able to lift the market much. However, when bar 10 dipped below the bar 7 low, the bulls bought\naggressively on limit and market orders (and stop orders).\nBar 14 was a small breakout test of the breakout above bar 11, and many traders bought there on limit orders, lifting the market.\nThe spike up to 13 was followed by the channel to 15 and then the test of the bottom of the channel at 16, where the market created a double\nbottom bull flag as it often does in a spike and channel bull trend. Buyers again bought at the market using limit orders at the same price as they did\nat bar 14, and this created a double bottom bull flag. Bar 16 dipped below the trend line from bar 5 to bar 10, and many traders bought this test at\nthe market and with limit orders. They then redrew the trend line and bought again with limit and market orders when bar 18 tested it and tested\nbelow it. The buyers aggressively returned at the same price where they had bought on the breakout above bar 11 and the pullback to bar 14.\nBar 17 was a dueling lines short setup because the trend channel line across the top of the wedge was in the area of the bar 2 high, and a major\nswing high is always a resistance area. Traders repeatedly shorted below the resistance line over the next several days, and the market finally\nbroke below the small double top formed by bars 17 and 19; this sell-off was also the start of the reversal down from the wedge top and large\ndouble top (bars 2 and 19). The market formed a trading range between bars 17 and 19, and traders repeatedly shorted tests of the top of the\nrange, many doing so with limit orders.\nThe bull spike and channel up to bar 8 was so strong that higher prices were likely to follow. Although some traders buy at the market and on tiny\npullbacks all of the way up, many traders only buy on pullbacks, like in the area of the bar 9 and bar 10 test of the bar 7 bottom of the bull channel.\nThey buy on limit orders as the market is falling, as well as on stops above the high of the prior bar in areas of support. Since the trend was up,\nunless the market fell below the most recent higher low at bar 5, or below the bar 3 bottom of the swing, buying well below the bar 8 high would\nallow traders to use a smaller stop, reducing their risk. The trend is less certain after the sell-off to bars 9 or 10, reducing the probability of a\nprofitable long swing, but the rally to bar 8 was stronger than the sell-off to bar 9, so the odds still favored the rally. Once the market turned up\nsharply to bar 11, the bulls raised their stops to below the bar 10 low. The sell-off to bar 12 was sharp, but held above the stop.\nFigure 28.4 Fading Tests of Lines with Limit Orders\n", "text_clean": "process on bar 24.\nThe market was always-in long by the close of bar 24, so some bulls would have tried to buy the first bear close, which was on the next bar.\nHowever, the market never traded below the close of that bear bar, so most of their limit orders would probably not have been filled. This was a sign of urgency going into the close, and alert bulls would have also placed stop orders to go long above that bear bar because it was a breakout pullback buy setup. Many would not have been fast enough and would have chased the market up during the next bar, buying one- or two-tick pullbacks with limit orders as the bar was forming.\nAs the market was rallying up to bar 13, the trend was clearly up. Some traders placed limit orders to buy a Fibonacci 62 percent pullback, or any pullback of around 60 to 70 percent, with a stop below the bar 6 bull low. They were looking to buy where the reward would be about two or more times greater than the risk. Buying about two-thirds down for a test of the bull high was risking about one-third, making their target twice as large as their risk, which is always good. At the time they placed their orders, the trend was up, so buying a pullback had at least a 60 percent probability of an equidistant move (a move up equal to the size of their stop), and possibly a 60 percent chance of a new bull high (a reward twice as large as their risk). Entering on pullbacks to reduce risk is an approach used by many traders and has a strong trader's equation.\nFigure 28.3 Limit Order Setups This 60 minute chart of the SPY presented in Figure 28.3 shows many examples where institutions and traders almost certainly entered on limit or market orders. Bar 3 was a climactic bottom of a bear channel, which was a bull flag, and a possible expanding triangle bottom. Bar 1 was the second push down, and the swing low that preceded it was the first. After the bar 3 low, traders were so confident that the market was going higher on the leg down to bar 5 that they bought at the market and limit orders above the bar 4 low. Whenever a double bottom bull flag looks like this, it is because the bulls are so afraid of missing the new trend that they put their orders many ticks above the bar 4 low rather than at it or one tick above it. This led to a spike up to bar 6 and then a channel to bar 8. A trader could also have entered with a limit order in that area, risking about a point to below the bar 4 low and holding for a test of the tops of trading ranges in the channel at 105, 108, and maybe even 110. Each of these was the start of a channel down after a bear spike, and they were magnets. Traders were risking one point to make three to seven points and the probability was at least 40 percent, which made this a logical trade. Alternatively, they could have entered on a stop above the high of bar 5. This increased the probability of success to about 60 percent because they were then buying a confirmed bottom of a trading range (a double bottom). Their risk was to below the signal bar, which was about one point, and their first profit target was two points higher, again making for a sound strategy.\nBar 6 was the top of a strong bull spike and therefore the chance of any pullback being followed by a higher high was about 70 percent. Many traders therefore bought below its low. Other traders bought one tick above the bar 7 high 1 on a stop. When the market tested that price area again, they bought some at bar 9 but were not able to lift the market much. However, when bar 10 dipped below the bar 7 low, the bulls bought aggressively on limit and market orders (and stop orders).\nBar 14 was a small breakout test of the breakout above bar 11, and many traders bought there on limit orders, lifting the market.\nThe spike up to 13 was followed by the channel to 15 and then the test of the bottom of the channel at 16, where the market created a double bottom bull flag as it often does in a spike and channel bull trend. Buyers again bought at the market using limit orders at the same price as they did at bar 14, and this created a double bottom bull flag. Bar 16 dipped below the trend line from bar 5 to bar 10, and many traders bought this test at the market and with limit orders. They then redrew the trend line and bought again with limit and market orders when bar 18 tested it and tested below it. The buyers aggressively returned at the same price where they had bought on the breakout above bar 11 and the pullback to bar 14.\nBar 17 was a dueling lines short setup because the trend channel line across the top of the wedge was in the area of the bar 2 high, and a major swing high is always a resistance area. Traders repeatedly shorted below the resistance line over the next several days, and the market finally broke below the small double top formed by bars 17 and 19; this sell-off was also the start of the reversal down from the wedge top and large double top (bars 2 and 19). The market formed a trading range between bars 17 and 19, and traders repeatedly shorted tests of the top of the range, many doing so with limit orders.\nThe bull spike and channel up to bar 8 was so strong that higher prices were likely to follow. Although some traders buy at the market and on tiny pullbacks all of the way up, many traders only buy on pullbacks, like in the area of the bar 9 and bar 10 test of the bar 7 bottom of the bull channel.\nThey buy on limit orders as the market is falling, as well as on stops above the high of the prior bar in areas of support. Since the trend was up, unless the market fell below the most recent higher low at bar 5, or below the bar 3 bottom of the swing, buying well below the bar 8 high would allow traders to use a smaller stop, reducing their risk. The trend is less certain after the sell-off to bars 9 or 10, reducing the probability of a profitable long swing, but the rally to bar 8 was stronger than the sell-off to bar 9, so the odds still favored the rally. Once the market turned up sharply to bar 11, the bulls raised their stops to below the bar 10 low. The sell-off to bar 12 was sharp, but held above the stop.\nFigure 28.4 Fading Tests of Lines with Limit Orders", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["process on bar 24.", "The market was always-in long by the close of bar 24, so some bulls would have tried to buy the first bear close, which was on the next bar.", "However, the market never traded below the close of that bear bar, so most of their limit orders would probably not have been filled.

You should not ignore that 40 percent any more than you should dismiss someone 30 yards away who is shooting at you but\nwho has only a 40 percent chance of hitting you. Forty percent is very real and dangerous, so always respect the traders who believe the opposite\nof you. The most important part of your plan is to have a protective stop in the market in case the market goes against you. It is better to have the\nstop working, because many traders who use mental stops find too many reasons to ignore them when they are needed most, and they invariably\nallow their small loss to grow and grow. There are several approaches to placing stops, and any of them is fine. The most important consideration\nis that you have the stop order working in the market instead of just in your head.\nThe two main types of protective stops are money management stops, where you risk a certain number of ticks or dollars, and price action stops,\nwhere you get out if the market moves beyond a certain price bar or price level. Many traders use both or either, depending on the situation. For\nexample, a trader who uses a two-point stop in the Emini for most of his trades might use a three-point stop if the bars are large. A price action\ntrader who just went long might initially place a protective sell stop at one tick below the low of the signal bar. However, if the bar is unusually large,\nlike six points tall, she might instead either trade far fewer contracts or switch to a money management stop of about three points. In general, using\none method most or all of the time is best because then it is such a part of your routine that you will always have a protective stop working as soon\nas you enter any trade. This saves you from the distraction of having to think about what type and size stop you should be using in different\nsituations when your focus needs to be on deciding whether to take the trade.\nFor most small scalps, traders do not want to see any pullbacks and will often exit as soon as one appears. However, if they believe that the\nmarket has entered a trend channel, they will usually allow small pullbacks. For example, if the day is a trading range day and the market just had a\nspike up off the low of the range and now might be forming a small bull channel that could test the top of the range, the profit goal of a trader who\nwent long would be limited and therefore the trade would be a scalp. Since the market is in a bull channel, it will likely have pullbacks, which means\nthat a bar might trade below the low of the prior bar by a few ticks, but not below the most recent swing low in the channel. Since the trader\nsuspected that the market might enter a channel and he still went long, he has to be willing to hold through those pullbacks and keep his protective\nstop below the most recent swing low in the channel. Aggressive, experienced traders might even buy more on a limit order at the low of the prior\nbar, since they know that channels typically have one- or two-bar pullbacks yet continue to work higher.\nIf traders are buying for a swing, then they are expecting a bull trend. Since a bull trend is a series of higher highs and higher lows, it is\nreasonable to move the protective stop to below the most recent swing low after the market makes a new swing high. This is called a trailing stop. If\nthe market trades up for five or 10 bars, pulls back to below the entry price, and trades up to a new swing high, traders will not want the market to\ntrade below the low of that pullback and will move their protective stop to one tick below its low. Many traders would not want their stop to be tested\na second time and would simply move their stop to breakeven.\nOnce traders see the market break out into what they believe will be a trending trading range day, they have to be ready to change their trading\nstyle as the market begins to form the second trading range. For example, if there is a bull breakout lasting a couple of bars followed by a one-bar\npullback and then a weaker rally, the low of that pullback bar will probably become the low of the upper trading range. Since the market usually tests\nback into the breakout gap and often to the top of the lower trading range, the odds are that it will fall below the low of that pullback bar. Therefore,\nbulls should not trail their stops below that low, since they will get stopped out. If they were thinking about placing protective stops there, it makes\nmore sense to exit on the close of a bull trend bar within the next several bars, so that they would be taking profits near the top of the developing\ntrading range rather than below the bottom. Once the market evolves into a trading range, traders should no longer trade it as if it was still in a\nstrong trend.\nSome traders will allow pullbacks beyond the signal bar as long as they believe that their premise for a swing trade is still valid. For example, if\nthey bought a high 2 pullback in a bull trend and the signal bar is about two points tall, they might be willing to hold on to their position even if the\nmarket falls below the low of the signal bar, thinking that it might evolve into a high 3, which is a wedge bull flag buy setup. Other traders would exit if\nthe market fell below the signal bar and then buy again if a strong high 3 buy signal sets up. Some might even buy a position that is twice as large\nas their first because they see the strong second signal as more reliable. Many of these traders would have bought just a half-size position on the\nhigh 2 buy signal if they thought that the signal did not look quite right. They were allowing for the possibility of the high 2 failing and then evolving\ninto a wedge bull flag, which might even look stronger. If this happened, they would then feel comfortable trading their usual full size.\nOther traders trade half size when they see questionable signals, exit if their protective stop is hit, and then take the second signal with a full size\nif the signal is strong. Traders who scale in as a trade goes against them obviously do not use the signal bar extreme for their initial protective stop,\nand many look to scale in exactly where other traders are taking losses on their protective stops. Some simply use a wide stop. For example, when\nthe average daily range in Eminis is less than about 15 points, a pullback in a trend is rarely more than seven points. Some traders will consider\nthat the trend is still in effect unless the market falls more than between 50 to 75 percent of the average daily range. As long as a pullback is within\ntheir tolerance, they will hold their position and assume that their premise is correct. If they bought a pullback in a bull trend and their entry was three\npoints below the high of the day, then they might risk five points. Since they believe that the trend is still in effect, they believe that they have a 60\npercent or better chance of an equidistant move. This means that they are at least 60 percent certain that the market will go up at least five points\nbefore falling five points to their protective stop, which creates a profitable trader's equation. If their initial buy signal in the bull pullback came at five\npoints below the high, then they might risk just three points, and they would look to exit their long on a test of the high. Since the pullback was\nrelatively large, the trend might be a little weak, and this might make them take profits on a test of the trend high. They would try to get at least as\nmuch as they had to risk, but they might be willing to get out just below the old high if they were concerned that the market might be transitioning into\na trading range or possibly even reversing into a bear trend.\nOnce the market finally begins to enter a trading range, traders should look to take at least partial profits around the high of the range, rather than\nrelying on their trailing stops. This is because it is likely that the market will begin to have pullbacks that fall below prior swing lows. As soon as\ntraders believe that their stops will likely get hit, it makes sense to exit before that happens, especially if they have already met most of their profit\nobjectives.\n", "text_clean": "Chapter 29\nProtective and Trailing Stops Since most trades are only 60 percent certain at best, you always have to have a plan for that other 40 percent of the time when the trade does not do what you expect.

The most important consideration is that you have the stop order working in the market instead of just in your head.\nThe two main types of protective stops are money management stops, where you risk a certain number of ticks or dollars, and price action stops, where you get out if the market moves beyond a certain price bar or price level. Many traders use both or either, depending on the situation. For example, a trader who uses a two-point stop in the Emini for most of his trades might use a three-point stop if the bars are large. A price action trader who just went long might initially place a protective sell stop at one tick below the low of the signal bar. However, if the bar is unusually large, like six points tall, she might instead either trade far fewer contracts or switch to a money management stop of about three points. In general, using one method most or all of the time is best because then it is such a part of your routine that you will always have a protective stop working as soon as you enter any trade. This saves you from the distraction of having to think about what type and size stop you should be using in different situations when your focus needs to be on deciding whether to take the trade.\nFor most small scalps, traders do not want to see any pullbacks and will often exit as soon as one appears. However, if they believe that the market has entered a trend channel, they will usually allow small pullbacks. For example, if the day is a trading range day and the market just had a spike up off the low of the range and now might be forming a small bull channel that could test the top of the range, the profit goal of a trader who went long would be limited and therefore the trade would be a scalp. Since the market is in a bull channel, it will likely have pullbacks, which means that a bar might trade below the low of the prior bar by a few ticks, but not below the most recent swing low in the channel. Since the trader suspected that the market might enter a channel and he still went long, he has to be willing to hold through those pullbacks and keep his protective stop below the most recent swing low in the channel. Aggressive, experienced traders might even buy more on a limit order at the low of the prior bar, since they know that channels typically have one- or two-bar pullbacks yet continue to work higher.\nIf traders are buying for a swing, then they are expecting a bull trend. Since a bull trend is a series of higher highs and higher lows, it is reasonable to move the protective stop to below the most recent swing low after the market makes a new swing high. This is called a trailing stop. If the market trades up for five or 10 bars, pulls back to below the entry price, and trades up to a new swing high, traders will not want the market to trade below the low of that pullback and will move their protective stop to one tick below its low. Many traders would not want their stop to be tested a second time and would simply move their stop to breakeven.\nOnce traders see the market break out into what they believe will be a trending trading range day, they have to be ready to change their trading style as the market begins to form the second trading range. For example, if there is a bull breakout lasting a couple of bars followed by a one-bar pullback and then a weaker rally, the low of that pullback bar will probably become the low of the upper trading range. Since the market usually tests back into the breakout gap and often to the top of the lower trading range, the odds are that it will fall below the low of that pullback bar. Therefore, bulls should not trail their stops below that low, since they will get stopped out. If they were thinking about placing protective stops there, it makes more sense to exit on the close of a bull trend bar within the next several bars, so that they would be taking profits near the top of the developing trading range rather than below the bottom. Once the market evolves into a trading range, traders should no longer trade it as if it was still in a strong trend.\nSome traders will allow pullbacks beyond the signal bar as long as they believe that their premise for a swing trade is still valid. For example, if they bought a high 2 pullback in a bull trend and the signal bar is about two points tall, they might be willing to hold on to their position even if the market falls below the low of the signal bar, thinking that it might evolve into a high 3, which is a wedge bull flag buy setup. Other traders would exit if the market fell below the signal bar and then buy again if a strong high 3 buy signal sets up. Some might even buy a position that is twice as large as their first because they see the strong second signal as more reliable. Many of these traders would have bought just a half-size position on the high 2 buy signal if they thought that the signal did not look quite right. They were allowing for the possibility of the high 2 failing and then evolving into a wedge bull flag, which might even look stronger. If this happened, they would then feel comfortable trading their usual full size.\nOther traders trade half size when they see questionable signals, exit if their protective stop is hit, and then take the second signal with a full size if the signal is strong. Traders who scale in as a trade goes against them obviously do not use the signal bar extreme for their initial protective stop, and many look to scale in exactly where other traders are taking losses on their protective stops. Some simply use a wide stop. For example, when the average daily range in Eminis is less than about 15 points, a pullback in a trend is rarely more than seven points. Some traders will consider that the trend is still in effect unless the market falls more than between 50 to 75 percent of the average daily range. As long as a pullback is within their tolerance, they will hold their position and assume that their premise is correct. If they bought a pullback in a bull trend and their entry was three points below the high of the day, then they might risk five points. Since they believe that the trend is still in effect, they believe that they have a 60 percent or better chance of an equidistant move. This means that they are at least 60 percent certain that the market will go up at least five points before falling five points to their protective stop, which creates a profitable trader's equation. If their initial buy signal in the bull pullback came at five points below the high, then they might risk just three points, and they would look to exit their long on a test of the high. Since the pullback was relatively large, the trend might be a little weak, and this might make them take profits on a test of the trend high. They would try to get at least as much as they had to risk, but they might be willing to get out just below the old high if they were concerned that the market might be transitioning into a trading range or possibly even reversing into a bear trend.\nOnce the market finally begins to enter a trading range, traders should look to take at least partial profits around the high of the range, rather than relying on their trailing stops. This is because it is likely that the market will begin to have pullbacks that fall below prior swing lows.

If the entry bar is a doji, then rely on your original stop. Remember that a doji is a single-bar trading\nrange, and if you just bought, you don't want to exit (sell) below a trading range in what you think is a bull trend (or if you just shorted, you don't want\nto buy above a trading range in a new bear trend).\nIn fact, experienced traders can consider adding on at a tick or two below a small doji entry bar in a possible new bull trend (or above a doji entry\nbar in a new bear trend), relying on the initial stop location for the stop on the added contracts. They are buying below the low 1 short signal bar\nbecause they think that the market is going up, not down. A low 1 is a short setup at the bottom of a strong bear spike in a bear trend, or near the\ntop of a trading range (in a trading range, it is better to wait to short a low 2), not at the bottom of a trading range or at the bottom of a new bull\ntrend. Since a short down there is likely to fail, the two-point protective buy stop is more likely to be hit than is a six-tick profit-taking limit order\nplaced below the low 1 signal bar. This means that buying below the low 1 signal bar will probably be followed by the market going up at least two\npoints before falling six ticks. Since traders think this is a new bull trend or at least a trading range, they think that the market will go up at least three\nor four points, so this is a logical long trade.\nIf it is a bar in the opposite direction, then you have to make a decision. For example, say you just bought a pullback in a strong bull market and\nthe signal bar was a strong bull reversal bar at the end of a two-legged pullback to the moving average. If the entry bar becomes a bear reversal\nbar, you should usually just keep your protective stop below the signal bar. However, if you were buying a reversal up in a strong bear trend, you\nshould usually exit if the market falls below that bear entry bar. In some cases, you should even reverse to short, if the context makes sense. In\ngeneral, you should not be buying in a strong bear trend if you believe that a failed long would be a short setup. Very few traders are able to reverse\nin such a situation, and if the bear trend is still strong enough so that shorting low 1 setups makes sense, then it is probably too strong to be looking\nfor longs. Instead, a bull should wait for a strong rally and then look to buy a higher low pullback. Buying in a bear trend before there has been\nevidence that the bulls can control the market is a losing strategy. Since most bull reversals become bear flags, it is far better not to buy and instead\nto look to short, unless the reversal setup is especially strong (this is discussed in the chapter on trend reversals in the third book).\nIf the bars at the time of entry into any trade are too large, it is wiser to use a money management stop, like eight ticks on the Emini 5 minute\nchart, or about a 70 percent pullback (a couple of ticks beyond the Fibonacci 62 percent pullback). For example, in a long off a large bull signal bar,\nyou would place the protective stop about 30 percent of the distance up from the bottom of the signal bar to the entry price. The size of the money\nmanagement stop is in proportion to the size of the bars. After the market reaches the first profit target and partial profits are secured, move the\nprotective stop to about breakeven (the entry price, which is one tick from the signal bar's extreme). The best trades will not hit a breakeven stop\nand will rarely ever go more than four ticks beyond the entry on the 5 minute Emini (for example, three ticks below the signal bar high after getting\nlong).\nIf you are very confident in the reversal because of a large, strong reversal bar and a confluence of other factors, you can use a stop beyond that\nlarge signal bar and allow a pullback after entry, as long as it does not hit your stop. You might even allow a stop of a couple of points beyond your\nsignal bar, but if you do, calculate your risk and reduce your position size to keep your risk the same as on your other trades. Also, if you are\nconfident that a reversal is strong enough to make two legs likely, and if the market comes back through your original entry by a few ticks after\nyou've scalped out part of your trade, you can hold through the pullback and rely on your original stop, despite being in a drawdown of several ticks.\nOtherwise (for example, in a new long) you will exit the swing portion at breakeven and then buy again above the high of the bar that ran your stop,\ngiving up a couple of points or more of what you considered to be a very high-probability second leg.\nIf you are entering a quiet pullback that you believe is about to end and the bars are small, you might consider using your usual money\nmanagement stop, even if it means that you are risking several ticks beyond your signal bar. For example, if the day is a bear trend day with a low-\nmomentum bull channel up to the moving average that forms a low 4 short setup and the signal bar is a three-tick-tall doji bar, traders who believe\nthat the pullback is about to end might risk their usual eight ticks, even though the stop would then be four ticks above the signal bar. Low 4 setups\noften form in tight channels, and the entry is a breakout below the tight channel. Tight channel breakouts usually have pullbacks, and sometimes they\ngo beyond the signal bar. Here, a higher high breakout pullback would not be surprising. As long as the traders believe that their premise is still\nvalid, they can allow the trade some room. Alternatively, they could exit if the market goes above the entry or signal bar and then sell again as the\nmarket turns down again; but if they are confident in their analysis, they can rely on their original eight-tick stop and allow the higher high pullback. In\ngeneral, if you are in a losing trade, ask yourself if you would put the trade on now if you were flat. If the answer is no, then get out. If your premise is\nno longer valid, then exit, even with a loss.\nWhen you are concerned that the market might be volatile and have large bars, you should trade only a fraction of your usual position size. Just\ncut your position size in half or down to a quarter and place the order. If you are buying and are confident that a low will hold, but a long trade would\nrequire a much greater money management stop than you typically use, you can use the larger stop and then wait. If the market hits your profit target\nwithout much of a pullback, take your profit. However, if it only goes a tick or so beyond your entry, pulls back almost to your stop, and then starts up\nagain above your entry price, raise your profit target. As a general rule, the market will rally enough to equal the size of the stop that it required you\nto have to stay in the trade. So if the market dipped 11 ticks below your entry before reversing back up, a stop of only 12 ticks would have worked;\ntherefore the market will likely go about 12 ticks or more above your entry price. It would be wise to place a limit order to exit with a profit at a tick or\ntwo less than this and, when it approaches the target, to move your stop to breakeven and wait to see if your profit target order gets filled. For\nexample, suppose the pullback was 11 ticks, your stop beyond the signal bar was not hit (maybe it was 12 or even 18 ticks), and now the market is\nagain going in your direction; calculate the total number of ticks that you would have had to risk to avoid being stopped out. At this point, you would\nhave had to risk 12 ticks (one beyond the pullback). Now increase your profit target to one or two ticks less than the risk, or 11 ticks. You also\nshould adjust your protective stop at this point to one tick beyond that pullback, so you are now risking 12 ticks.\nWhen a protective stop is hit before making a scalper's profit, you were trapped into a bad trade, so reversing on the stop is occasionally a good\nstrategy. This depends on the context. For example, a failed low 2 short is a good reversal into a long trade when you think that the market is\nreversing into a bull trend. However, a stop run in a tight trading range is not a reversal. Take time to make sure that you are reading the chart\ncorrectly before considering a trade in the opposite direction. If you don't have time to get right back in, wait for the next setup, which will always\ncome before too long.\nAfter studying a market, you will see what a reasonable stop is. For the Emini 5 minute chart when the average daily range is 10 to 15 points,\neight ticks works well on most days. However, pay close attention to the maximum size stop required in the first hour, because this often becomes\nthe best stop to use for the rest of the day. If the stop is more than eight ticks, you will likely be able to increase the size of your profit target as well.\nHowever, this provides a modest advantage at best unless the bars are exceptionally big.\nThere are a couple of common setups that usually require a large stop, which means trading a smaller position. Both involve entering around the\nclose of a strong spike in a trend, but the two trades are in opposite directions.

For example, if there is\na strong bull breakout that has two large bull trend bars, bulls will buy the close of the second bar and above its high. If it is followed by a third, fourth,\nand fifth consecutive bull trend bar, bulls will keep buying as the bull spike grows. The theoretical stop for all of their entries is below the bottom of\nthe spike, which is far away. If traders used that for their stop, they need to trade a very small position size to keep their risk within their comfort\nzone. Realistically, most traders would consider scalping a larger position and using a smaller stop when they enter late in the spike. This is\nbecause a pullback becomes more likely, and it would allow them to then put a swing position on at a lower price and with a smaller stop, like\nbelow the signal bar.\nThe second situation when traders are entering during a large trend bar and need a large stop is when they are entering countertrend. For\nexample, if there is a third consecutive sell climax without a significant pullback, and that third one has the largest bear trend bar of the day and\ncloses near its low, aggressive bulls will buy the close of the bar, expecting it to be at or near the low of the swing; they will also expect a strong rally\nto follow. Reliable protective stop placement in this situation is never certain, but as a rule, since traders expect the rally to go at least to the high of\nthe large bear trend bar and they are 60 percent certain of the trade, they should risk about as many ticks as there are in the bear trend bar. This is\ndiscussed more in the chapter on climaxes in book 3. If they are very experienced traders, this can be a reliable trade. The volume is often huge in\nthese situations, which means that the institutions are buying heavily as well. The bears are taking profits on their shorts, and the bulls are\naggressively buying. Both often wait for a large bear trend bar into support as a sign of exhaustion, and then buy heavily. Because they were\nexpecting the bottom to form very soon, they stepped aside and stopped buying just above support, and this creates a sell vacuum in the form of\nthe large bear trend bar.\nThere are many other special situations when a trader might use an unusually wide protective stop. I have a friend who looks for weak channels\nand scales in against them, expecting a reversal. For example, if the market is in a bull channel after a bull spike and the channel is not particularly\nstrong, he places a limit order to go short at the prior swing high in the channel, using about a quarter of his normal position size, and adds on\nabove the next two or three swing highs if the channel continues. When the average daily range in the Emini is about 10 to 15 points, his final stop\nis about eight points from his first entry and his target is a test of his first entry. Once the reversal is underway, if he thinks that it is strong, he will\noften swing part of his position below his original entry.\nTraders can use wide stops when they are fading breakouts in stairs patterns or on trending trading range days. If the average range in the Emini\nis about 10 to 15 points and there is a breakout that runs about five points, a trader might fade the breakout and risk about five points to make five\npoints, expecting a test of the breakout. In a typical situation, this trade has better than a 60 percent chance of success and therefore has a positive\ntrader's equation.\nTraders sometimes fade large trend bar breakouts of one-bar final flags at the ends of big trends, expecting that the trend bar is an exhaustive\nclimax (this is discussed in the chapter on climactic reversals in book 3). For example, if there is a bull trend that has gone on for 30 bars or so with\nonly small pullbacks, and then there is a large bull trend bar followed by a one- or two-bar pullback, bulls and bears will sell the close of the next bar\nif it is also a large bull trend bar. The bulls will sell to take profits, and aggressive bears will sell to initiate shorts. The bears will risk about the height\nof the bar (if the bar is 10 ticks tall, they will use about a 10-tick stop), and their initial profit target will be a test of the bottom of the bar. The next\ntarget is a measured move down.\nI have another friend who routinely uses a five-point stop when entering on pullbacks in the Emini. He feels that he cannot consistently predict the\nend of a pullback and instead enters when he thinks that the trend is resuming. He just assumes that he sometimes enters early and that the\npullback might go a little further before the trend resumes, and the wide stop allows him to stay in the trade. His profit target is a test of the trend's\nextreme, which might be three to five points away. If the resumption is strong, he will swing the trade, looking for five or more points. Although there\nare many variations to this approach, the average risk is generally about the size of the average reward, and since it is a with-trend strategy, the\nprobability is at least 60 percent. This means that the strategy has a positive trader's equation.\nWhenever traders use a wide stop, as soon as the market begins to turn in their direction they are usually able to tighten the stop and greatly\nreduce their risk. Once a swing trade reaches about halfway to the profit target, many traders will move their protective stop to break even. If the\nmarket moves strongly in their direction, the probability of success increases, the potential reward can remain the same or they might increase it,\nand the risk becomes smaller. This increases the strength of the trader's equation and is why many traders prefer to wait to enter until the market is\nable to get to this point. If, however, the reversal is very weak, although traders can tighten their stop and reduce their risk, their probability of\nsuccess will be less and they might also reduce their reward (tighten their profit-taking limit order). If the trader's equation is weak enough, they\nmight try to scalp out with a small profit and wait for another trade.\nThe goal is to make money, which requires a positive trader's equation. If the size of the bars requires a large stop, that is what you must use, but\nyou also must adjust your target to keep the trader's equation positive. You should also reduce your position size.\nIn a big market, there might be a hundred institutions actively trading, each contributing about 1 percent of the total volume. Of the other 99\npercent of the volume, only 5 percent is from individual traders. Institutions are going to try to take money from other institutions, which make up 94\npercent of the market, not the 5 percent of dollars traded by people at home. Institutions could care less about us and are not out there running our\nstops, trying to devour the little guy. If your stop gets hit, it has nothing to do with you. For example, if you were long and your protective sell stop got\nhit, you should assume that it was because there was at least one institution that also wanted to sell at that price. Only rarely will enough small\ntraders do the same thing to offer enough volume to attract an institution, so it is better to assume that the market will only trade at any price if there\nis both an institution willing to sell there and another willing to buy there.\nFigure 29.1 The Initial Stop Is Just beyond the Signal Bar\n", "text_clean": "are several consecutive trend bars, traders will enter in the direction of the trend as the bars are forming and as they close.

Once the entry bar closes, move the stop to one tick beyond the entry bar if the bar\nis strong. If the risk is too great, use a money management stop or risk about 60 percent of the height of the signal bar.\nIf you shorted on bar 1 on the breakout below the bear inside bar, the initial stop would have been above the signal bar. The bar 1 entry bar\nreversed up immediately after entry but did not exceed the top of the signal bar, so this would have eventually ended up as a profitable short scalp.\nOnce the entry bar closed, if it is a bull or bear trend bar and not a doji bar, move the stop up to one tick above its high. In this example, the signal\nand entry bars had the same high, so the stop would not have to be tightened.\nThe bar before bar 3 was a bull reversal bar after three pushes down on the open. Although buying the first breakout of a tight bear channel is not\nusually a good trade, reversals in the first hour are usually reliable, especially when the prior day had a strong close (look at the steep slope of the\nmoving average going into yesterday's close). The bar 3 entry bar immediately sold off but did not fall below the low of the signal bar, or below\nabout 70 percent of its height (if you used a money management stop, thinking that this signal bar was too big to use a price action stop below its\nlow). Once an entry bar closed, the protective stop should have been moved up to one tick below its low. If the market fell below its low, many\ntraders would have gone short because this was a breakout pullback short setup. However, since this was not a strong bear spike, it was not a\nreliable low 1 short. Alternatively, a trader could have kept the stop below the signal bar, but when bottom picking in a strong bear trend, it is risky to\nhold a long if the market falls below a strong bear trend bar that is a low 1 short signal bar.\nTwo bars later, there was a pullback bar, but it did not hit the stop. It tested the entry bar low to the tick, creating a double bottom. Since this\nwedge bottom was likely to have two legs up, it was reasonable for an experienced trader to hold through the pullback that occurred two bars after\nentry and to rely on the stop below the entry bar. Otherwise, you would have been stopped out for seven ticks and then you would have bought\nabove the high of the pullback bar to catch the second leg; your entry price would have been three ticks worse, so overall you would have been 10\nticks worse off.\nThe pullback to the moving average at bar 4 formed a double top with the bar 1 area, and it was a small wedge bear flag. Other traders would\nhave seen it as a simple low 2 at the moving average. The initial protective stop for the short at the bar 4 low 2 was not hit, despite a pullback bar\ntwo bars after entry. The stop was above the signal bar, and you should not tighten to above the high of the most recent bar until after the market\nhad moved about four ticks in your direction or until the market had a reasonably strong bear body. Give the trade time to work. Also, when the entry\nbar is a doji, it is usually safe to allow a one- or two-tick pullback. A doji bar is a one-bar trading range and it is risky to buy above a trading range,\nso don't buy back your short there. Rely on your original stop until the market has moved at least several ticks in your direction.\nThe bar 5 long immediately sold off to test the signal bar low (this was evident on the 1 minute chart, not shown) forming a micro double bottom\nand then a successful long scalp. Rely on your stop and ignore the 1 minute chart. When taking a 5 minute entry, rely on a 5 minute stop, else you\nwill lose too often and be stopped out of a great many trades in your attempt to risk less per trade.\nBar 7 was a high 2 long after a strong bull spike. The market tested the stop below the signal bar but missed by one tick, and then tested the\ntightened stop below the entry bar, but neither stop was hit. The dojis prior to entry increased the risk of the trade, but with six closes above the\nmoving average after the surge from a new low of the day, this was an acceptable long setup since you had to be expecting a second leg up.\nThe bar 8 ii pattern was a high 1 buy setup. However, it was not at the top of a strong bull spike in a strong bull trend and therefore it was not a\ngood trade. In fact, it was at the top of a bull channel after the spike up from the low of the day; it was around a measured move up, and it might\nhave been forming a double top with bar 4. Since most trading range breakout attempts fail, there was a 60 percent chance that the market would\ntrade down and only a 40 percent chance that the breakout would be successful. It is impossible to know the probabilities with certainty, but 60–40\nis a good rule of thumb when it comes to trading range breakout attempts. Aggressive traders would have shorted with a limit order at the high of\nthe ii pattern, expecting it to be a bull trap. If a trader instead bought above the bar 8 ii pattern, the protective stop was hit on the entry bar; this\nwould have been a good reversal, as are most failed ii patterns.\nIf you shorted the bar 11 swing high near the top of this trading range day, you could have reversed either on the bar 12 reversal bar that tested\nthe moving average or on a buy stop at one tick above the entry bar that followed the bar 11 short.\nThe short from the bar 13 swing high, low 2 became a five-tick failure and a failed low 2. You should have reversed to long on bar 14 at one tick\nabove the entry bar (the bar after the bar 13 signal bar) since there were trapped shorts, and you should have expected at least two more legs up. If\nyou did not buy there, you should have bought on the bar after bar 14 because bar 14 was a two-bar reversal up and a high 2 buy signal above the\nmoving average in a possible bull trend. Whenever traders are top picking and then see a high 2 buy signal at the moving average with a bull signal\nbar, they should always exit the short and reverse to long.

A doji bar is a one-bar trading range and it is risky to buy above a trading range, so don't buy back your short there. Rely on your original stop until the market has moved at least several ticks in your direction.\nThe bar 5 long immediately sold off to test the signal bar low (this was evident on the 1 minute chart, not shown) forming a micro double bottom and then a successful long scalp.

The market tested the stop below the signal bar but missed by one tick, and then tested the tightened stop below the entry bar, but neither stop was hit. The dojis prior to entry increased the risk of the trade, but with six closes above the moving average after the surge from a new low of the day, this was an acceptable long setup since you had to be expecting a second leg up.\nThe bar 8 ii pattern was a high 1 buy setup. However, it was not at the top of a strong bull spike in a strong bull trend and therefore it was not a good trade.

It is impossible to know the probabilities with certainty, but 60–40 is a good rule of thumb when it comes to trading range breakout attempts. Aggressive traders would have shorted with a limit order at the high of the ii pattern, expecting it to be a bull trap.

Experienced traders look to exit on strength, and then look to reenter on a pullback. For\nexample, if a bull trend is just beginning and is especially strong, bulls will buy more as the market breaks above the most recent swing high.\nHowever, as the trend matures and develops more two-sided trading, they will no longer buy on a stop above the most recent swing high. Instead,\nas the rally weakens, they will look to take some profits above that high, or even a little below. If most bulls are taking profits around the previous\nhigh and not buying more on the breakout, the market will begin to have a pullback. This means that the bulls would rather buy at a lower price and\nthey believe that there will be a pullback that will allow them to do this, so they are no longer willing to chase the market up, buying above prior\nhighs. If the profit taking is very heavy and if there is aggressive, relentless shorting as well, the pullback will grow into a large correction (a trading\nrange) or even a reversal. Bulls will also look to take profits on any sign of strength, like at the close and just above a large bull trend bar, or at the\nclose of the next bar or two, especially if it is a small bar or has a bear close. They will take more profits below the low of the next bar. This is why so\nmany large trend bars, which are breakout attempts, are followed by small bars and pullbacks, which means that the breakouts failed. Traders will\nalso have a stop order below the low of the prior bar, below the most recent higher low, or at breakeven. This is because if the market reverses\nstrongly before reaching their target, they might come to believe that they will be able to exit and then buy again at a better price. Bears initiating\nshorts see the same thing, and usually begin looking for scalps by selling at new highs or around the closes of strong bull trend bars. As the\npullbacks get deeper, they will begin to swing parts of their positions. Initially, they usually get stopped out of the swing portions of their trades, but\neventually they will get large swing profits as the corrections get deeper, or when the trend finally reverses.\nTraders behave similarly in bear trends. Bears will short below swing lows when the trend is strong, but as it weakens, they will instead buy back\ntheir shorts around and below the most recent swing low, and look to short again higher. A bull scalper will buy new lows and scalp out on a small\nrally, around where the bears are shorting again. Both the bulls and the bears wait for a relatively large bear trend bar that breaks to a new low, at\nwhich point both will buy around its close. As the bear rallies get stronger, the bulls will be more willing to swing some of their positions. At some\npoint, the market will transition into a large bull swing or trend, and the process will begin in the opposite direction. Understanding trend bars that\ncreate breakouts is one of the most important skills that a trader can acquire. Traders need to be able to assess whether a breakout is likely to\nsucceed, whether it will be met with profit taking and a pullback, or whether it will be followed by a reversal. Each of these is discussed in detail\nelsewhere in the three books.\nWhen you enter a trade, your goal is to have the market reach your profit target before it hits your protective stop. Unlike protective stops, which\nshould always be working in the market whenever you are holding a position, profit targets can be either in the market or in your head. For example,\nif you are swing trading in a strong trend, you might take profits on some of your position along the way (this is scaling out of your trade) and you\nmight choose to hold on to some of your position until there is a signal in the opposite position. Once that opposite signal triggers, you should exit.\nVery few traders have the ability to reverse a position by simultaneously exiting a profitable swing position and entering a new trade in the opposite\ndirection.\nScalpers often have order cancels order or one cancels the other (OCO) orders working as soon as they enter. For example, they might buy\nAAPL for a 100 cent scalp and risk 50 cents when they buy a pullback where they are 60 percent or more certain that the trade will be successful.\nAs soon as they enter, their initial order might automatically generate both a protective sell stop order at 50 cents below their entry price and a sell\nlimit order at 100 cents above their entry price. Since this bracket order is OCO, as soon as one of the pair is filled, the other is automatically\ncanceled. No matter how you manage your orders, you should check your account after every entry and exit to make sure that your current position\nand orders are what you think they should be. You don't want to be flat (have no position) and still have a buy limit order working when you thought\nthat it should have been automatically canceled. Never assume that your broker's software will work as expected 100 percent of the time, or that\nyou placed your trades and orders correctly. There is an inescapable failure rate with everything, and you should always confirm what you expect\nhas been done after you believe it should have been done.\nAll trades should be made on the basis of the trader's equation, and beginning traders should look for trades where the probability of success is\n60 percent or higher, and the reward is at least as large and preferably about twice the size of the risk, although a setup with that strong a trader's\nequation happens only a couple of times on an average day. For example, if the average daily range in the Euro FX Currency Futures or the foreign\nexchange (forex) equivalent, the EUR/USD, has lately been about 100 ticks (often referred to as pips), and there have been several 20-tick moves\nevery day where a 10-tick protective stop would not have been hit, a trader might look to enter trends on pullbacks to the moving average, so that\nthe probability of a winning trade is likely 60 percent or greater. The trader who carefully selects a setup has about a 60 percent chance of making\n20 ticks while risking about 10 ticks, and this has an excellent trader's equation. In 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures, if the average daily range\nhas been about 32 ticks (16/32 of a point) and many signal bars have been four ticks tall, a trader could again look to enter on pullbacks to the moving\naverage, risking about six ticks and using a profit target of eight ticks. This again has a strong trader's equation.\nTrade management is different for scalps than it is for swings. A trader who is taking a scalp believes that the profit potential is limited either\nbecause there is no trend or because he is trading against the trend. Scalping in a trading range can be a profitable strategy, but only the most\nexperienced traders should consider trading against the trend. The chances of making money are far greater if a trader can patiently wait for a\npullback and enter in the direction of the trend, rather than hoping that a countertrend trade will be successful. Once you believe there is a trend, you\nmust accept that 80 percent of reversal attempts will fail and evolve into flags. This makes it almost impossible for most traders to enter\ncountertrend trades on stops and consistently make a profit. For example, if you think that a small bear reversal bar at the top of a strong bull trend\nwill be followed by a pullback to the moving average, and you short on a stop at one tick below the low of the bar, you must realize that very smart\nbulls have limit orders to buy at the low of that bar, and the odds are on their side. If you are trading the Emini, you need the market to fall ten ticks\nbelow the low of that bar for you to make an eight-tick profit on your short, but most pullbacks in a strong bull trend will turn into high 1 or high 2 buy\nsetups before that happens, and you will lose money. If you see that there is a strong trend and you want to buy a pullback, do not fool yourself into\nbelieving that you have enough talent to be able to profitably trade a short scalp as you wait for the buy setup to form. Invariably, you will lose money\non the short scalp and not take the buy setup when it forms. You will be hoping for more down and be in denial that the pullback is about to end, and\nyou will miss the long that might be good for several points of profit.\n", "text_clean": "Chapter 30\nProfit Taking and Profit Targets All pullbacks and reversals begin with profit taking.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 209, "text_raw": "After the trend has turned into a trading range, then countertrend trading is really not countertrend, because the trend has temporarily ended.\nHowever, many traders try to pick the top of a bull trend or the bottom of a bear trend, believing that the market is about to enter a trading range and\nthinking that their risk is small, only to watch their accounts slowly melt away.\nWhenever traders enter any trade, they need a plan to take profits, because otherwise the market will eventually turn on them and their profits will\nturn into losses. Trade management depends entirely on the trader's equation, and any combination of risk, reward, and probability that results in a\nconsistent profit is an effective strategy. As a general rule, most traders should restrict themselves to high-probability trades where the risk is at\nleast as great as the potential reward. Ideally, traders should look for setups where the chance of success is at least 60 percent and the potential\nreward is about twice the size of the risk, but usually they will have to settle for a reward that is about the same size as their risk, or maybe a little\nbigger. This most often happens in pullbacks in trends.\nWhen swinging a trade in a strong trend, it is easy to take profits too early because it is so difficult to believe that the trade might run five or more\ntimes more than the size of your stop. However, when a trend is strong, that can be the case. If you believe that the trend is strong, it is reasonable\nto take about half of your position off after the market has gone your way for a distance equal to about twice the size of your original protective stop.\nFor example, if your initial stop in the Emini was two points and you shorted in a strong bear trend near what you think will be the start of a big swing\ndown, exit half of your position on a limit order at four points below your entry. At that point, trail your stop. You might take another quarter off at three\ntimes your original stop size, at six points, then let the last quarter run, and exit only if a strong buy signal develops or at the close of the day,\nwhichever comes first. However, exiting the entire position at twice the risk is a reasonable approach if you are uncomfortable scaling out of a\ntrade.

You might take another quarter off at three times your original stop size, at six points, then let the last quarter run, and exit only if a strong buy signal develops or at the close of the day, whichever comes first.

More traders are willing to scale out than are willing to scale in; in fact, many traders regularly\nscale out of trades. For example, if you exit part of your position for a scalp and then exit the balance for a swing, you are scaling out of your trade.\nScaling into a trade means that you are adding to your position. Institutions like mutual funds have to scale into and out of positions constantly\nbecause they receive new money and requests for redemptions every day. Individual traders commonly use scaling in when they enter in the\ndirection of the trend during a pullback and when fading the extremes of a trading range, and when they dollar cost average. Scaling into a potential\nreversal is very risky; it is usually better to exit if the market goes against you and then look for a second entry.\nYou can scale in either as the trade moves against you or as it moves in your direction. If you scale in after you already have a profit, this is also\nreferred to as adding to your position, or pressing your trade. For example, if the market is in a bull channel, bulls will add to their positions on every\npullback as the market goes higher. The same is true of a strong bull spike. Many traders quickly add to their longs as the spike rapidly grows, bar\nafter bar. Strong spikes always create brief opportunities when the trader's equation is exceptional, and some traders are adept at pressing their\ntrades in these fast markets. Each additional purchase is usually at a higher price, and all of their earlier entries are profitable. Bears who are\nshorting in the bull channel as the market is going higher are scaling in above the highs of prior bars and adding on as the trade continues higher.\nEach earlier entry has a growing loss, but the bears expect that once the market reverses, they will have a net profit. I have a friend who is an expert\nat scaling into countertrend trades in channels in the Emini, looking for a reversal. He looks for the market to test the beginning of the channel,\nwhere he takes profits. For example, if the recent average range lately in the Emini has been about 10 to 15 points, and today has a spike and\nchannel bull trend that has had a couple of pushes up and is not particularly strong, he would start to short on limit orders at the most recent swing\nhigh, and add to his position at the next one or two new highs in the channel, as long as each new entry was at least two points higher than the prior.\nEach of his one to three entries was for about 10 contracts. I chatted with him many times years ago as he took these trades, and the market never\nwent much beyond his second or third entry before reversing and going his way, so the stop was never an issue in our conversation. However, I\nassume that it had to be at least a few points beyond his final entry. According to my math, I believe that he was willing to risk between $5,000 and\n$10,000 for his 30 contracts. I am telling this story not to advocate what he was doing, because very few people have the experience to trade like\nthat. However, he is an interesting, real example of a trader who specializes in a particular type of scaling in and makes a living by doing it.\nThe key premise to scaling into a trade that is moving against you is that you believe that the market will soon turn in your direction and that you\nwill be able to make a profit. You should never scale into a losing position unless you are confident about the big picture, and the best situation is\nwhen you believe that you are scaling into a growing pullback in a strong trend and with a clear always-in direction. Most traders never add to a\nlosing position and instead let themselves get stopped out, and then look to re-enter if there is another signal. However, many traders feel that they\ncan never be certain of the exact bottom or top of a trend or trading range, but are confident when the market is close to a reversal. Some of those\ntraders take the reversal trade and use a wide stop. Others use a tight stop, and if the market goes against them, they get stopped out and then\nlook for another entry. Scale in traders trade a much smaller position size initially and will add to their position if the market continues against them,\nas long as they believe that their premise remains valid. If the market goes their way immediately, many will look to build their position up to full size\nby pressing their bets. They were willing to scale in at either a better or worse price. For example, if they bought a reversal up from the bottom of a\nlarge trading range and were willing to scale in lower, but instead the market immediately goes their way, they might add to their position on\npullbacks as the market continues to rally toward the top of the trading range. Other traders might trade half size, add the second half lower, and\nthen look to exit the first half at breakeven on the reversal up, and swing the second half with a breakeven stop. If you are scaling into a losing\nposition and you then decide that the big picture has changed and your premise is no longer valid, you must exit your trade and take your loss. Even\nif the market begins to turn your way, if you feel that your original target has become unrealistic, do not hold on and hope that your premise will once\nagain become valid. You have to always trade the market that is in front of you and not the one that you want or the one that you had a few bars ago.\nThe market changes with every tick, and if your original target is now unrealistic, look for a new target and get out there, even if that means that you\nwill be taking a loss. For example, if you scaled into an always-in bull market and it then flipped to an always-in bear direction, you should exit and\nlook for short trades instead of hoping that the always-in bull market will once again return. Hope is never a sound basis for holding a position,\nbecause the market is based on mathematics and not luck, fairness, emotion, karma, or religion.\n“Never add to a losing position.” That is one of the most fundamental rules on Wall Street. However, it is misleading because institutions do it all\nthe time and it is part of many profitable strategies. How can that possibly be? It is because the adage refers to countertrend trades and the\ninstitutions are scaling into with trend trades. Whenever an institution feels that the market has gone too far up or down, it sees value in doing the\nopposite. Because no one can regularly pick exact turning points, many institutions enter in pieces over the course of many bars. They do not care\nif some of the entry signals form when their earlier entries have an open loss. As long as they see value and have a large position to build, they will\nwork to fill it at the best possible price, regardless of whether it is above or below their earlier entries. This is similar to dollar cost averaging for an\nindividual investor. If an investor has some cash and wants to buy stock, he might use 10 percent of the cash to buy on the first of each of the next\n10 months, regardless of whether the later entries are at a lower price. Dollar cost averaging is a successful approach and more often than not\nrequires an investor to add to a losing position. However, this is far different from a trader who buys at the bottom of a strong bear spike, thinking\nthat there has to be a bounce soon.

More traders are willing to scale out than are willing to scale in; in fact, many traders regularly scale out of trades. For example, if you exit part of your position for a scalp and then exit the balance for a swing, you are scaling out of your trade.\nScaling into a trade means that you are adding to your position. Institutions like mutual funds have to scale into and out of positions constantly because they receive new money and requests for redemptions every day. Individual traders commonly use scaling in when they enter in the direction of the trend during a pullback and when fading the extremes of a trading range, and when they dollar cost average. Scaling into a potential reversal is very risky; it is usually better to exit if the market goes against you and then look for a second entry.\nYou can scale in either as the trade moves against you or as it moves in your direction. If you scale in after you already have a profit, this is also referred to as adding to your position, or pressing your trade. For example, if the market is in a bull channel, bulls will add to their positions on every pullback as the market goes higher. The same is true of a strong bull spike. Many traders quickly add to their longs as the spike rapidly grows, bar after bar. Strong spikes always create brief opportunities when the trader's equation is exceptional, and some traders are adept at pressing their trades in these fast markets. Each additional purchase is usually at a higher price, and all of their earlier entries are profitable. Bears who are shorting in the bull channel as the market is going higher are scaling in above the highs of prior bars and adding on as the trade continues higher.\nEach earlier entry has a growing loss, but the bears expect that once the market reverses, they will have a net profit. I have a friend who is an expert at scaling into countertrend trades in channels in the Emini, looking for a reversal. He looks for the market to test the beginning of the channel, where he takes profits. For example, if the recent average range lately in the Emini has been about 10 to 15 points, and today has a spike and channel bull trend that has had a couple of pushes up and is not particularly strong, he would start to short on limit orders at the most recent swing high, and add to his position at the next one or two new highs in the channel, as long as each new entry was at least two points higher than the prior.\nEach of his one to three entries was for about 10 contracts. I chatted with him many times years ago as he took these trades, and the market never went much beyond his second or third entry before reversing and going his way, so the stop was never an issue in our conversation. However, I assume that it had to be at least a few points beyond his final entry. According to my math, I believe that he was willing to risk between $5,000 and $10,000 for his 30 contracts. I am telling this story not to advocate what he was doing, because very few people have the experience to trade like that. However, he is an interesting, real example of a trader who specializes in a particular type of scaling in and makes a living by doing it.\nThe key premise to scaling into a trade that is moving against you is that you believe that the market will soon turn in your direction and that you will be able to make a profit. You should never scale into a losing position unless you are confident about the big picture, and the best situation is when you believe that you are scaling into a growing pullback in a strong trend and with a clear always-in direction. Most traders never add to a losing position and instead let themselves get stopped out, and then look to re-enter if there is another signal. However, many traders feel that they can never be certain of the exact bottom or top of a trend or trading range, but are confident when the market is close to a reversal. Some of those traders take the reversal trade and use a wide stop. Others use a tight stop, and if the market goes against them, they get stopped out and then look for another entry. Scale in traders trade a much smaller position size initially and will add to their position if the market continues against them, as long as they believe that their premise remains valid. If the market goes their way immediately, many will look to build their position up to full size by pressing their bets. They were willing to scale in at either a better or worse price. For example, if they bought a reversal up from the bottom of a large trading range and were willing to scale in lower, but instead the market immediately goes their way, they might add to their position on pullbacks as the market continues to rally toward the top of the trading range. Other traders might trade half size, add the second half lower, and then look to exit the first half at breakeven on the reversal up, and swing the second half with a breakeven stop. If you are scaling into a losing position and you then decide that the big picture has changed and your premise is no longer valid, you must exit your trade and take your loss. Even if the market begins to turn your way, if you feel that your original target has become unrealistic, do not hold on and hope that your premise will once again become valid. You have to always trade the market that is in front of you and not the one that you want or the one that you had a few bars ago.\nThe market changes with every tick, and if your original target is now unrealistic, look for a new target and get out there, even if that means that you will be taking a loss. For example, if you scaled into an always-in bull market and it then flipped to an always-in bear direction, you should exit and look for short trades instead of hoping that the always-in bull market will once again return. Hope is never a sound basis for holding a position, because the market is based on mathematics and not luck, fairness, emotion, karma, or religion.\n“Never add to a losing position.” That is one of the most fundamental rules on Wall Street. However, it is misleading because institutions do it all the time and it is part of many profitable strategies. How can that possibly be? It is because the adage refers to countertrend trades and the institutions are scaling into with trend trades. Whenever an institution feels that the market has gone too far up or down, it sees value in doing the opposite. Because no one can regularly pick exact turning points, many institutions enter in pieces over the course of many bars. They do not care if some of the entry signals form when their earlier entries have an open loss. As long as they see value and have a large position to build, they will work to fill it at the best possible price, regardless of whether it is above or below their earlier entries. This is similar to dollar cost averaging for an individual investor. If an investor has some cash and wants to buy stock, he might use 10 percent of the cash to buy on the first of each of the next 10 months, regardless of whether the later entries are at a lower price. Dollar cost averaging is a successful approach and more often than not requires an investor to add to a losing position. However, this is far different from a trader who buys at the bottom of a strong bear spike, thinking that there has to be a bounce soon. When the market falls straight down for two more bars, he buys more, and then more again even lower, as he attempts to lower his average cost. Soon, he is hoping for any bounce up to near his average entry price so that he can get out at breakeven.\nInvariably, his position has become so large that he decides that he has to get out on the next bear trend bar. That bar is usually a large sell climax and he exits with a huge loss, many times greater than the original profit he was trying to make from his buy scalp, and his exit is at the bottom of the market just before a huge rally.\nThere is a sound mathematical basis for scaling into or out of a trade, but many traders do it simply because they discovered that it works and they don't care about the reasoning.

A trader can scale:\nInto longs on a small pullback from a strong bull spike (a pullback is a small countertrend channel).\nInto shorts on a small pullback from a strong bear spike.\nInto longs as a bear channel falls or into shorts as a bull channel rises.\nInto longs as a pullback falls further (pullbacks are small trends and therefore are in channels) or into shorts as a bear rally rises. For\nexample, if there is a steeply rising moving average, bulls will scale into longs on a pullback below the moving average.\nAt fixed intervals in pullbacks in any strong trend based on the size of the prior pullbacks and the recent average daily range.\nInto longs or into shorts in a trading range.\nInto a countertrend position during a breakout if a pullback to the breakout point is likely, like in a broad channel day, in a trending trading\nrange day, or in a stairs pattern.\nThere are many ways to scale into or out of a position since there are so many variables, which include:\nThe number of times that you will scale in. You can scale in one time or many times.\nSizes of your positions. If you are allowing for the possibility of scaling in if the market goes against you, make sure to keep your initial\npositions small enough so that the risk on your final position is within your usual tolerance.\nThe number of shares entered at each level. Your first entry can be for 100 shares, the second can be for 200, and the third can be for\n500 or any number. However, most traders scale in with the same number of shares each time.\nThe prices of the different entries. The steps don't have to be fixed, which means that you can scale into a long at 20 cents below the\nfirst entry and again at 30, 70, or any number of cents below that. Alternatively, you can enter at the first reversal signal and if the trend\ncontinues, you can scale in at the next reversal signal and maybe the one after that as well.\nThe risk. This is how far your protective stop is from your average entry price.\nThe reward. This is how far your profit-taking limit order is from your average entry price.\nThe probability. It is never known with certainty, and it varies with the amount of risk, reward, and average entry price. For example, the\nprobability of making 30 cents while risking 30 cents is greater than the probability of making 30 cents while risking 20 cents but less\nthan the probability of making 30 cents while risking 40 cents.\nScaling involves uncertainty, which is inherent in channels and trading ranges where two-sided trading is taking place. The trader is betting that a\nshort-term move is ending and that a larger move is about to begin. This is true even in a trading range, like when a trader is scaling into longs\nduring a bear leg in the belief that the bigger picture is that of a trading range and that the small bear leg will probably fail to convert the trading\nrange into a bear trend. Any combination of the variables that results in the chance of winning times the potential reward being greater than the\nchance of losing times the risk is a valid strategy. You always know the risk and the potential reward because you set them when you place your\nprotective stop and your profit-taking limit order. You never know the probability with certainty, but you usually know when it is 60 percent or greater;\nif you are uncertain, then assume that it is 50 percent.\nWhenever you scale in against a trend, as a general rule you should exit if the market makes a second move against you. This means that if you\nare bottom picking in a bear trend and the market forms a low 2 short, especially if it is near the moving average and has a bear signal bar, you\nshould exit your longs and even consider reversing to short. If you still believe that a bottom is near, you can look to begin to scale in again lower.\nAlso, it is risky to scale in against a trend in the final hour or so of the day, because you will too often find yourself holding a large losing position that\nyou will have to cover by the close. Time is against you. Finally, it is risky to scale in against any strong trend. For example, if you believe that the\nmarket is in a strong bear trend, then you must believe it will soon be lower. If you believe that it will soon be lower, then it is too early to begin to\nbuy. When a trend is strong, the only type of scaling in that you should consider is adding to your with-trend position.\nThere is a mathematical basis for scaling into and out of positions, but that does not mean that scaling in or out is the wisest use of your money.\nFor example, suppose you believe that the chance that a stock now trading at $20 will fall to zero is 1 percent or less so you then buy 100 shares of\na stock; if you scale in at each $5 drop, you would buy 100 more shares at $15, 100 more at $10, and 100 more at $5.00. You would then be long\n400 shares with an average price of $12.50. Yes, the stock might not fall to zero, but you now need a 150 percent rally to get back to breakeven,\nand it is almost certain that you will make more money if you exit all of your shares at a loss and instead use the money to buy a stock that is in a\nstrong uptrend.\nTraders can also scale out of winning and losing trades. In that bull channel example, those bulls who were scaling into their longs as the bull\nchannel went up would stop buying at some point and begin to take profits. If they took part of their trades off, they were scaling out of their trades.\nThe bears might have decided that the reversal they were expecting would not be as strong as they originally thought and they might buy back some\nof the shorts that they just sold. If the market went another 10 ticks against them, they might buy back even more and look to short again higher.\nThey were scaling out of their losing positions, although they might be planning to scale back in later.\nOne guideline that you can use to determine where to place your second entry is to think about how far away your protective stop would be if you\nwere not scaling in. For example, if you were buying a pullback in a bull trend in Bank of America Corporation (BAC) and were thinking about using\na 30 cent stop, you might instead buy more at that price and place a protective stop on your entire position 30 cents lower, or 60 cents below your\nfirst entry.\nThere are many ways to scale into a trade that is moving against you, and you can scale in any number of times. You can scale in at fixed\nintervals or at different support or resistance levels or at each subsequent reversal setup. You can make each subsequent entry the same size as\nthe original or you can make them larger or smaller. The most important point is that if you are allowing for the possibility of scaling in, you have to\nhave a plan at the outset. If you are not comfortable with creating a plan, do not scale into a losing position, even if you are buying a pullback in a\nstrong bull trend or selling a bear rally in a strong bear trend. You must know where your final protective stop is and what your average entry price is,\nbecause you need to keep your total risk within your normal range.

{"book": "RANGE", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\16695\\Desktop\\LLM\\tradeBooks\\range2.pdf", "page_index": 215, "text_raw": "When bulls are confident that the market is going higher and skeptical that there will soon be a pullback that would allow them to buy lower, they\nbegin to buy at the market and keep buying all the way up. In Figure 31.4, Apple (AAPL) had a large gap up, then a pullback, and then a bull\nbreakout at bar 6. The odds favored a bull trend day, and traders believed that even if there were a pullback, the market would soon reach a new\nhigh. Therefore, it made mathematical sense to begin buying at the market and on any tiny pullback, like maybe 10 cents. Traders and institutions\ncontinued to buy relentlessly but not with enough urgency or size to cause a huge bull trend bar and possible climactic reversal. They were scaling in\nall the way up to bar 10, because they believed that the first pullback would not go too far and it would be bought aggressively enough to push the\nmarket to a new high.\nWhen the trend is this strong, you have to believe that the market will soon be higher. If you believe that it will soon be higher, it does not make\nsense to begin scaling into a short position, because if you wait, you can short at a better price. When a channel is strong, you should never scale in\nagainst the trend.\nThe market had about a $1.00 spike and channel bear pullback to the moving average at bar 13, where the bulls finally overwhelmed the bears.\nThey pushed the market up to a nominal new high where even the traders who had bought at bar 10 could get out at breakeven. Many of those\ntraders were momentum traders who keep buying until the trend changes, and they were happy to add on at the bar 13 first moving average gap\nbar. They then exited their longs from bar 10 at breakeven, and their longs from bar 13 with a 60 cent profit.\nBulls might also have scaled in on the sell-off down to bar 19, believing that the bull trend was so strong that the pullback should lead to a test of\nthe high. Bar 18 was a strong bull reversal bar, and bulls might have bought above its high. Since the bear channel was steep, these bulls knew that\nthe market might fall further, but they wanted to be sure that they caught at least some of what they thought would be a trend resumption. Because\nthe pullback might not have been over, some would have bought only a half-size position and would have looked to add on maybe 50 cents lower.\nThey would have been filled on the move down to bar 19. Others would simply have looked for another bottom attempt and then bought more above\nthe signal bar, like above the bar 19 high. Bar 19 was a large two-legged sideways to down correction where bar 13 was the first leg, and it was\nabout a measured move down from the bars 10 and 14 double top. Although they might scale out of some of their positions on the test of their first\nentry at the bar 18 high, most would have held for a larger profit.

In the chart shown in Figure 31.5,\ntraders who had limit orders to buy a touch of the moving average got filled on bar 9, but unfortunately for them, the market spiked down. Many\ntraders would have scaled in lower because they were confident that the market would soon rally back up to the moving average, and it often rallies\nall the way back to their initial purchase. The bar 15 high was exactly the price where the bar 9 longs bought the pullback to the moving average.\nWhy did the market turn down at bar 15? Because many traders who scaled into longs on the sell-off to bar 11 sold out of their longs around\nbreakeven for their initial entry, which was where bar 9 touched the moving average. They made a profit on their lower entries and got out at\nbreakeven on their first entry. Their goal was a profitable long based on a steeply rising moving average, and once they achieved their goal, they\nsold out of their longs and there was no one left to buy.\nWhen there is a possible reversal, many traders don't buy the first touch of the moving average. Instead, they will start to buy below the moving\naverage. For example, the traders who bought at bar 9 might have scaled into additional longs at each one point lower. Other traders might instead\nhave begun buying at one, two, or even more points lower and then could have scaled in at each one-point drop from there for maybe two or three\n", "text_clean": "When bulls are confident that the market is going higher and skeptical that there will soon be a pullback that would allow them to buy lower, they begin to buy at the market and keep buying all the way up.

The odds favored a bull trend day, and traders believed that even if there were a pullback, the market would soon reach a new high. Therefore, it made mathematical sense to begin buying at the market and on any tiny pullback, like maybe 10 cents. Traders and institutions continued to buy relentlessly but not with enough urgency or size to cause a huge bull trend bar and possible climactic reversal. They were scaling in all the way up to bar 10, because they believed that the first pullback would not go too far and it would be bought aggressively enough to push the market to a new high.\nWhen the trend is this strong, you have to believe that the market will soon be higher. If you believe that it will soon be higher, it does not make sense to begin scaling into a short position, because if you wait, you can short at a better price.

They then exited their longs from bar 10 at breakeven, and their longs from bar 13 with a 60 cent profit.\nBulls might also have scaled in on the sell-off down to bar 19, believing that the bull trend was so strong that the pullback should lead to a test of the high. Bar 18 was a strong bull reversal bar, and bulls might have bought above its high. Since the bear channel was steep, these bulls knew that the market might fall further, but they wanted to be sure that they caught at least some of what they thought would be a trend resumption. Because the pullback might not have been over, some would have bought only a half-size position and would have looked to add on maybe 50 cents lower.\nThey would have been filled on the move down to bar 19. Others would simply have looked for another bottom attempt and then bought more above the signal bar, like above the bar 19 high. Bar 19 was a large two-legged sideways to down correction where bar 13 was the first leg, and it was about a measured move down from the bars 10 and 14 double top. Although they might scale out of some of their positions on the test of their first entry at the bar 18 high, most would have held for a larger profit.

Since two-bar spikes are common in the first 30 minutes and are often followed by\npullbacks, some bears would have kept their protective stops above bar 2 to allow for a possible lower high. Other bears saw bar 3 as such a\nstrong bear trend bar and an entry bar (for traders who shorted below the bar 2 signal bar) that they would have put their stops above bar 3.\nThe next bar was a strong bull reversal bar, but since a lower high was likely after two strong bear trend bars, most traders would have held short.\nThe market went one tick above the bar, trapping weak bears out and weak bulls in, and then reversed down at bar 4.\nSome traders would have shorted on a stop below bar 4 and would have entered two bars later. The doji close of the entry bar would have made\nthem nervous, but then the bear spike began.\nBar 5 had a strong bear body, so some traders would have shorted its close, and others would have shorted below its low.\nBar 6 was the second bar in the spike and had a large bear body. At this point, many traders saw it as a breakout from the opening range. The\nbulls finally gave up and the bears became very confident that the day's range would expand to the downside to reach around the average daily\nrange of recent days. Traders shorted its close. Aggressive traders would have kept shorting closes until there was a bar with a large tail or a bull\nbody. Even when one forms, it is the first pause or pullback and the market will usually go down again within a few bars so that the traders who had\nshorted the close of the bar before will still be able to make a scalper's profit. Once the pause bar forms after a spike of several bars, most traders\nstop entering on the close.\nThe market rallied to bar 16, and traders wondered if it might form a higher low and then have a second leg up. The bar 17 strong bear trend bar\nbroke out below any possible bull flag and made traders think that a new low of the day was likely. Traders shorted its close and the close of the bar\n18 follow-through bar. Bar 19 was a pause bar, so bears stopped shorting closes.\nBar 23 was a strong bull reversal bar and a two-bar reversal on the third push down of the day, and traders saw it as a possible wedge bottom or\nas a higher time frame wedge bull flag.

Some traders shorted the bar 36 close, but the market reversed up into a two-bar reversal at bar 37 and the bears would have\nexited. They would have thought that this was a bear trap and a false breakout of the bull channel, and they saw the market reversing up at a higher\nlow (above bar 31) and wondered if the bull trend would resume.\nBulls bought above the two-bar reversal at bar 37 and again on the closes of bars 38 and 39. The next bar was a pause bar, so they stopped\nbuying closes. The traders who bought on the close of bar 39 exited on the bar 41 bear bar.

Let's say that you are comfortable trading two contracts, scalping one for one point and\nswinging the other until the trend ends. If you took any of the early short entries on bars 2, 3, or 4, you would have scalped out one contract during\nbar 5. On the close of bar 5, you could put your scalp contract back and once again be short two contracts. You would have scalped one out during\nbar 8 and added it back on at the close of bar 8.

You could repeat\nthis again on the close of bar 7 and on the close of bar 8. At that point, your swing position would be four contracts, but you would have a breakeven\nstop on three. You would also have one scalp contract, so your total position size would be five contracts, but your total risk would be the same as\nyou normally have when you trade two contracts.\n", "text_clean": "entries.

In Figure 31.7, the move down to bar 2 was about half of an average range, so the upside breakout that began at bar 6 could have led to a\nmeasured move up and then an upper range, creating a trending trading range day.

They could have added\nto their shorts either above other swing highs, like above bar 9, or at fixed intervals, like one and two points higher. They were shorting near the top\nof the channel, which is the ideal location for shorts. They could have taken profits at the breakout test that occurred on the spike down to bar 21.\nBulls would have scaled in below the low of the prior bar after the strong spike up to bar 7. They would have bought below the inside bar after bar\n7 and again below bars 9, 11, and maybe 13. Since bar 13 was the third push up in the channel, and channels often correct for at least 10 bars\nafter three pushes, most bulls would have been taking profits at this point instead of scaling in. Also, just as they would have scaled in below bars\non the way up, they would have taken partial or full profits above the highs of prior bars, above swing highs, and at the closes of strong bull trend\nbars. All of these would have been near the top of the channel, which is where bulls tend to exit and bears tend to enter.\nBulls saw the move up to bar 13 as a sign of strength, and therefore they might have been willing to scale in on the bear channel down to bar 22.\nThey might have first bought above the bar 19 bull reversal bar and then they could have added on at the second signal above bar 22, as the\nmarket tried to form a double bottom with the bar 8 bottom of the bull channel. Alternatively, they could have scaled in at fixed intervals, like one and\ntwo points below their original long entry above bar 19. They could have scaled out part at their original entry there and taken the rest off on the bar\n26 test of the bar 18 top of the channel, or they could have scaled out at fixed intervals, like part at breakeven and then more at one point and then\ntwo points higher.\nFigure 31.8 Entering Where Weak Traders Exit\nThe market often hits obvious protective stops to the tick and then reverses. If traders are just looking for a few major reversals a day, they have to\nbe willing to use wider stops, because the market often hits round number protective stops located at two, three, four, or five points from the entry\nprice to the tick and then reverses. If a trader shorted below bar 3 in Figure 31.8 and used a three-point stop, it would have been hit to the tick at the\nbar 9 high. However, if the trader was willing to scale in, he might have an order to short more exactly where the weak traders are getting stopped\nout. Because a three-point stop here was logical since it was the appropriate size for the recent price action and it was at a new high of the day, an\nastute trader looking to scale in would have placed a limit order to short more at 11 ticks above the first entry, one tick below the three-point stop.\nA trader who bought the lower low at bar 13 or the second reversal up at bar 20 had the same experience with a three-point stop. It would have\nbeen hit to the tick. The alternative again was to scale in just shy of the obvious stop.\nThe initial trading range was about half of the size of an average day, so when traders saw the breakout down to bar 11, they knew that there was\nabout a 60 percent chance or better that this would be a trending trading range day and that there would be a test of the bar 4 breakout point.\nTraders could have bought on limit orders at two, three, and four points below bar 4. They would have been filled on only their first order, and they\ncould have exited with two points’ profit on the move up to bar 12, which went a few ticks above the bar 4 breakout point.\nTraders who saw the trending channels recognized that every breakout to a new low was followed by a pullback above the old low.

They could have taken profits at the breakout test that occurred on the spike down to bar 21.\nBulls would have scaled in below the low of the prior bar after the strong spike up to bar 7. They would have bought below the inside bar after bar 7 and again below bars 9, 11, and maybe 13. Since bar 13 was the third push up in the channel, and channels often correct for at least 10 bars after three pushes, most bulls would have been taking profits at this point instead of scaling in. Also, just as they would have scaled in below bars on the way up, they would have taken partial or full profits above the highs of prior bars, above swing highs, and at the closes of strong bull trend bars. All of these would have been near the top of the channel, which is where bulls tend to exit and bears tend to enter.\nBulls saw the move up to bar 13 as a sign of strength, and therefore they might have been willing to scale in on the bear channel down to bar 22.\nThey might have first bought above the bar 19 bull reversal bar and then they could have added on at the second signal above bar 22, as the market tried to form a double bottom with the bar 8 bottom of the bull channel. Alternatively, they could have scaled in at fixed intervals, like one and two points below their original long entry above bar 19. They could have scaled out part at their original entry there and taken the rest off on the bar 26 test of the bar 18 top of the channel, or they could have scaled out at fixed intervals, like part at breakeven and then more at one point and then two points higher.\nFigure 31.8 Entering Where Weak Traders Exit The market often hits obvious protective stops to the tick and then reverses. If traders are just looking for a few major reversals a day, they have to be willing to use wider stops, because the market often hits round number protective stops located at two, three, four, or five points from the entry price to the tick and then reverses. If a trader shorted below bar 3 in Figure 31.8 and used a three-point stop, it would have been hit to the tick at the bar 9 high. However, if the trader was willing to scale in, he might have an order to short more exactly where the weak traders are getting stopped out. Because a three-point stop here was logical since it was the appropriate size for the recent price action and it was at a new high of the day, an astute trader looking to scale in would have placed a limit order to short more at 11 ticks above the first entry, one tick below the three-point stop.\nA trader who bought the lower low at bar 13 or the second reversal up at bar 20 had the same experience with a three-point stop. It would have been hit to the tick. The alternative again was to scale in just shy of the obvious stop.\nThe initial trading range was about half of the size of an average day, so when traders saw the breakout down to bar 11, they knew that there was about a 60 percent chance or better that this would be a trending trading range day and that there would be a test of the bar 4 breakout point.\nTraders could have bought on limit orders at two, three, and four points below bar 4. They would have been filled on only their first order, and they could have exited with two points’ profit on the move up to bar 12, which went a few ticks above the bar 4 breakout point.\nTraders who saw the trending channels recognized that every breakout to a new low was followed by a pullback above the old low.

It is reasonable to wonder how\nthis can happen if most of the volume is generated by institutional computer orders—how can the institutional computers get it wrong so often?\nThose programs are often complex, and all of the institutions are using different methods. Some of the stop runs will be due to hedging or partial\nprofit taking, while others will be due to scaling into a position, and most will have nothing to do with a 5 minute chart. It is simplistic to think that they\nare all getting it wrong and were trapped by a stop, or that the stop run was due to the relatively small volume that comes from individual traders.\nWhat appears on the chart is the distilled product of a huge number of traders who are basing their decisions on a huge number of different and\nunknowable reasons. The result is that individual traders sometimes get trapped into or out of the market. Most institutions are not trading tick by\ntick, and they are not concerned by these little moves because they know that the math behind their models is sound. They don't see these moves\nas traps; it is likely that most don't see them at all and instead rely on their models and on the orders that their customers want them to fill. High-\nfrequency trading (HFT) firms, however, try to capitalize on any small move.\nFigure 32.1 Trapped Traders\nAs shown in Figure 32.1, today was filled with setups that trapped traders into bad trades and out of good trades, but if you had carefully read the\nprice action, you could have profited off each of these traps by placing limit orders to bet on the opposite direction.\nBar 2 was a bear trend bar on a gap up open and a possible high of the day, but with bar 1 being as strong as it was, it was probably better to\nwait for more information before shorting. Once the short triggered, alert traders would have bought above bar 2 on a stop, both because there\nwere trapped bears and because the market went above a strong bull trend bar on a gap up day and the day could become a trend from the open\nbull trend day.\nBar 5 was the third bear bar in a spike down from a possible high of the day, so even if the market were to trade above its high, a lower high and\na second leg down to the moving average were likely. A trader could have placed a sell limit order to go short at the bar 5 high and used a\nprotective stop either at the high of the day or above the bear entry bar that followed the bar 4 sell signal.\nThe bear channel down to bar 7 was steep, so even though it was a high 2 pullback to the moving average and a bull trend bar, bulls would have\nbeen wise to wait for a breakout pullback before going long. Aggressive traders would have shorted with a limit order at the bar 7 high for a scalp.\nThe move down to bar 9 was very strong, so buying the first attempt to rally was a bad trade. Traders could instead have placed a limit order to\nshort at the bar 9 high, expecting a new low within the next few bars.\nBar 12 was a large bear trend bar and therefore a sell climax, and it followed the sell climax down to bar 9. The low 2 at bar 11 might have been\nthe final flag in the bear trend before a larger correction ensued. Bar 13 was a low 1 short setup, but, since the market was no longer in a strong\nbear spike, this was a bad short. Traders could instead have placed a limit order to buy at the bar 13 low for a scalp.\nBar 14 was a weak low 2 short, since a correction lasting at least 10 bars was likely after the consecutive sell climaxes. Bulls could have bought\nthe low of bar 14, expecting a failed low 2 and a breakout to the upside. Bar 15 became an outside up bar, trapping bears into the low 2 short.\nBecause the bar was so quick to form, many bulls did not have time to understand what had taken place; they were trapped out and forced to chase\nthe market up.\nBar 16 was a low 1 short setup after five bull trend bars and therefore likely to fail. Bulls would have bought at the low of the bar.\nBar 17 was a high 1 long setup, but the bull spike had bars with small bodies and tails. This was not a strong bull spike, and therefore the high 1\nshould fail. Bears shorted with limit orders at the high of bar 17.\nBar 18 was a low 2 short setup, but the market was still in a strong bull channel and now was going sideways for six bars. This low 2 was likely to\nfail, so bulls bought its low for a scalp.\nBar 19 was a failed low 2 and therefore a buy setup, but the market was beginning to go sideways and have small bars, and this would have\nmade the third push up. Bears shorted at its high.\nBar 23 was a high 1 buy setup, but this was not a strong bull spike, so bears shorted at its high.\nBar 27 was a high 1 buy setup, but again the spike was not strong.
