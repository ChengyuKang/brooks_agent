If instead you\nthought that the breakout would fail, you would not use the term pullback and\ninstead would see the pullback as a failed breakout. For example, if there was a\nﬁve-bar breakout above a bear trend line but you believed that the bear trend would\ncontinue, you would be considering shorting this bear ﬂag and not looking to buy a\npullback immediately after it broke out to the downside.\nbreakout test\nA breakout pullback that comes close to the original entry price\nto test a breakeven stop. It may overshoot it or undershoot it by a few ticks. It can\noccur within a bar or two of entry or after an extended move or even 20 or more\nbars later.\nbull reversal\nA change in trend from a downtrend to an uptrend (a bull trend).\nbuying pressure\nStrong bulls are asserting themselves and their buying is creat-\ning bull trend bars, bars with tails at the bottoms, and two-bar bull reversals. The\neffect is cumulative and usually is eventually followed by higher prices.\ncandle\nA chart representation of price action in which the body is the area be-\ntween the open and the close. If the close is above the open, it is a bull candle and\nis shown as white. If it is below, it is a bear candle and is black.

Volume spikes also sometimes occur on daily\ncharts when a sell-off is overdone. However, it is not reliable enough to warrant\nmy attention.\nMany traders consider price action only when trading divergences and trend\npullbacks. In fact, most traders using indicators won’t take a trade unless there is\na strong signal bar, and many would enter on a strong signal bar if the context was\nright, even if there was no divergence. They like to see a strong close on a large\nreversal bar, but in reality this is a fairly rare occurrence. The most useful tools\nfor understanding price action are trend lines and trend channel lines, prior highs\nand lows, breakouts and failed breakouts, the sizes of bodies and tails on candles,\nand relationships between the current bar to the prior several bars. In particular,\nhow the open, high, low, and close of the current bar compare to the action of\nthe prior several bars tells a lot about what will happen next. Charts provide far\nmore information about who is in control of the market than most traders realize.\nAlmost every bar offers important clues as to where the market is going, and a\ntrader who dismisses any activity as noise is passing up many proﬁtable trades\neach day. Most of the observations in these books are directly related to placing\ntrades, but a few have to do with simple curious price action tendencies without\nsufﬁcient dependability to be the basis for a trade.\nI personally rely mainly on candle charts for my Emini, futures, and stock trad-\ning, but most signals are also visible on any type of chart and many are even evident\non simple line charts. I focus primarily on 5 minute candle charts to illustrate ba-\nsic principles but also discuss daily and weekly charts as well. Since I also trade\nstocks, forex, Treasury note futures, and options, I discuss how price action can be\nused as the basis for this type of trading.\nAs a trader, I see everything in shades of gray and am constantly thinking in\nterms of probabilities. If a pattern is setting up and is not perfect but is reasonably\nsimilar to a reliable setup, it will likely behave similarly as well. Close is usually\nclose enough. If something resembles a textbook setup, the trade will likely unfold\nin a way that is similar to the trade from the textbook setup. This is the art of\ntrading and it takes years to become good at trading in the gray zone. Everyone\nwants concrete, clear rules or indicators, and chat rooms, newsletters, hotlines,\nor tutors that will tell them when exactly to get in to minimize risk and maximize\nproﬁt, but none of it works in the long run. You have to take responsibility for your\ndecisions, but you ﬁrst have to learn how to make them and that means that you\nhave to get used to operating in the gray fog.

In particular, how the open, high, low, and close of the current bar compare to the action of the prior several bars tells a lot about what will happen next. Charts provide far more information about who is in control of the market than most traders realize.\nAlmost every bar offers important clues as to where the market is going, and a trader who dismisses any activity as noise is passing up many proﬁtable trades each day. Most of the observations in these books are directly related to placing trades, but a few have to do with simple curious price action tendencies without sufﬁcient dependability to be the basis for a trade.\nI personally rely mainly on candle charts for my Emini, futures, and stock trading, but most signals are also visible on any type of chart and many are even evident on simple line charts.

This is the art of trading and it takes years to become good at trading in the gray zone. Everyone wants concrete, clear rules or indicators, and chat rooms, newsletters, hotlines, or tutors that will tell them when exactly to get in to minimize risk and maximize proﬁt, but none of it works in the long run. You have to take responsibility for your decisions, but you ﬁrst have to learn how to make them and that means that you have to get used to operating in the gray fog.

When you enter on a 5 minute\nchart, your trade is based on your analysis of the 5 minute chart without any idea\nof what the 1 minute chart looks like. You must therefore rely on your ﬁve-minute\nstops and targets, and just accept the reality that the 1 minute chart will move\nagainst you and hit a one-minute stop frequently. If you watch the 1 minute chart,\nyou will not be devoting your full attention to the 5 minute chart and a good trader\nwill take your money from your account and put it into his account. If you want to\ncompete, you must minimize all distractions and all inputs other than what is on the\nchart in front of you, and trust that if you do you will make a lot of money. It will\nseem unreal but it is very real. Never question it. Just keep things simple and follow\nyour simple rules. It is extremely difﬁcult to consistently do something simple, but\nin my opinion, it is the best way to trade. Ultimately, as a trader understands price\naction better and better, trading becomes much less stressful and actually pretty\nboring, but much more proﬁtable.\nAlthough I never gamble (because the combination of odds, risk, and reward\nare against me, and I never want to bet against math), there are some similari-\nties with gambling, especially in the minds of those who don’t trade. Gambling is a\ngame of chance, but I prefer to restrict the deﬁnition to situations where the odds\nare slightly against you and you will lose over time. Why this restriction? Because\nwithout it, every investment is a gamble since there is always an element of luck\nand a risk of total loss, even if you buy investment real estate, buy a home, start a\nbusiness, buy a blue-chip stock, or even buy Treasury bonds (the government might\nchoose to devalue the dollar to reduce the real size of our debt, and in so doing, the\npurchasing power of the dollars that you will get back from those bonds would be\nmuch less than when you originally bought the bonds).\nSome traders use simple game theory and increase the size of a trade after one\nor more losing trades (this is called a martingale approach to trading). Blackjack\ncard counters are very similar to trading range traders. The card counters are try-\ning to determine when the math has gone too far in one direction. In particular,\nthey want to know when the remaining cards in the deck are likely overweighed\nwith face cards. When the count indicates that this is likely, they place a trade (bet)\nbased on the probability that a disproportionate number of face cards will be com-\ning up, increasing the odds of winning. Trading range traders are looking for times\nwhen they think the market has gone too far in one direction and then they place a\ntrade in the opposite direction (a fade).\nI tried playing poker online a few times without using real money to ﬁnd simi-\nlarities to and differences from trading. I discovered early on that there was a deal\nbreaker for me: I was constantly anxious because of the inherent unfairness due to\nluck, and I never want luck to be a large component of the odds for my success.\nThis is a huge difference and makes me see gambling and trading as fundamentally\n", "text_clean": "INTRODUCTION\nand you will instead cherry-pick, which will lead to the death of your account because you will invariably pick too many bad cherries.

If you watch the 1 minute chart, you will not be devoting your full attention to the 5 minute chart and a good trader will take your money from your account and put it into his account. If you want to compete, you must minimize all distractions and all inputs other than what is on the chart in front of you, and trust that if you do you will make a lot of money. It will seem unreal but it is very real. Never question it. Just keep things simple and follow your simple rules. It is extremely difﬁcult to consistently do something simple, but in my opinion, it is the best way to trade. Ultimately, as a trader understands price action better and better, trading becomes much less stressful and actually pretty boring, but much more proﬁtable.\nAlthough I never gamble (because the combination of odds, risk, and reward are against me, and I never want to bet against math), there are some similarities with gambling, especially in the minds of those who don’t trade. Gambling is a game of chance, but I prefer to restrict the deﬁnition to situations where the odds are slightly against you and you will lose over time. Why this restriction? Because without it, every investment is a gamble since there is always an element of luck and a risk of total loss, even if you buy investment real estate, buy a home, start a business, buy a blue-chip stock, or even buy Treasury bonds (the government might choose to devalue the dollar to reduce the real size of our debt, and in so doing, the purchasing power of the dollars that you will get back from those bonds would be much less than when you originally bought the bonds).\nSome traders use simple game theory and increase the size of a trade after one or more losing trades (this is called a martingale approach to trading). Blackjack card counters are very similar to trading range traders. The card counters are trying to determine when the math has gone too far in one direction. In particular, they want to know when the remaining cards in the deck are likely overweighed with face cards. When the count indicates that this is likely, they place a trade (bet) based on the probability that a disproportionate number of face cards will be coming up, increasing the odds of winning. Trading range traders are looking for times when they think the market has gone too far in one direction and then they place a trade in the opposite direction (a fade).\nI tried playing poker online a few times without using real money to ﬁnd similarities to and differences from trading. I discovered early on that there was a deal breaker for me: I was constantly anxious because of the inherent unfairness due to luck, and I never want luck to be a large component of the odds for my success.\nThis is a huge difference and makes me see gambling and trading as fundamentally", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["INTRODUCTION", "and you will instead cherry-pick, which will lead to the death of your account because you will invariably pick too many bad cherries.

For example, when there\nis a bear channel and a large bull bar forms, this breakout bar has a high and\nclose that are above the highs and closes of ﬁve or even 20 or more bars.

If they are looking at a collection of bars, they are trying to decide if the\nmarket is trending or it is in a trading range. For example, if it is trending up, they\nwill look to buy high or low, even on a breakout of the top of the move, whereas if it\nis in a trading range, they are only looking to buy at the bottom of the range and they\nwant to sell instead of buy at the top of the range.

However, if the market\nbreaks out to the upside and then the next bar is a small inside bar (its high is not\nhigher than that of the large breakout bar) and then the following bar has a low\nthat is below this small bar, the odds of a failed breakout and a reversal back down\nincrease considerably.\nSmall patterns evolve into larger patterns that can lead to trades in the same or\nopposite direction. For example, it is common for the market to break out of a small\nﬂag to reach a scalper’s proﬁt and then pull back, and the pattern then evolves into\na larger ﬂag. This larger ﬂag might also break out in the same direction, but it might\ninstead break out in the opposite direction. Also, a pattern often can be seen to be\nseveral different things at the same time.

Those ﬁrms\ncannot have the market go 15 ticks against them if they are trying to scalp four\nor eight ticks. Therefore, they will enter only when they feel that the risk of an\nadverse move is small. If you read their activity on the charts, you should like-\nwise be conﬁdent in your trade, but always have a stop in the market in case your\nread is wrong or other institutions overwhelm the current move with trades in the\nopposite direction.\nThere is often a pullback that tests the entry bar’s extreme to the tick. For\nexample, if there is a long entry, the buyers will often place their protective sell\nstop at one tick below the low of that entry bar just after the bar closes. It is fairly\ncommon to see a pullback that comes down exactly to the low of that entry bar but\nnot one tick lower. This means that the stops were not run, and that there must be\ninstitutional size volume protecting the stops. Since it is such an obvious price on\nthe chart, they are doing this buying based on price action.\nIn the 5 minute Emini, there are certain price action events that change the\nperspective of smart traders.

For example, in a strong bear,\nthere might be a long setting up with a very strong bull reversal bar. Then, with ﬁve\nseconds remaining before the bar closes, the price plummets and the bar closes on\nits low, trapping lots of front-running longs who expected a bull trend reversal bar.\nWhen trading countertrend against a strong trend, it is imperative to wait for the\nsignal bar to close before placing your order, and then only enter on a stop at one\ntick beyond the bar in the direction of your trade (if you are buying, buy at one tick\nabove the high of the prior bar on a stop).\nWhat is the best way to learn how to read price action? It is to print out charts\nand then look for every proﬁtable trade. If you are a scalper looking for 50 cents in\nAAPL or two dollars in GOOG on the 5 minute chart, then ﬁnd every move during\nthe day where that amount of proﬁt was possible. After several weeks, you will\nbegin to see a few patterns that would allow you to make those trades while risking\nabout the same amount. If the risk is the same as the reward, you have to win\nmuch more than 60 percent of the time to make the trade worthwhile. However,\nlots of patterns have a 70 percent or better success rate, and many trades allow\nyou to move your stop up from below the signal bar extreme to below the entry\nbar extreme while waiting for your proﬁt target to be reached, reducing your risk.\nAlso, you should be trying to enter trades that have a good chance of running well\npast your proﬁt target and you should therefore only take partial proﬁts.

There\nare also other bulls who are looking for a pullback and will buy near the low of\nthe bar if the market gets there. However, it is important to realize that there are\nother bulls who expect the strength to fail and they are using the strength as an\nopportunity to sell out of their longs and take proﬁts. There are also bears who see\nthe bull trend bar, no matter how strong, as a climactic, failed effort by the bulls,\nand are shorting around the high of the bar. Some were sitting on the sidelines,\nwaiting for a strong bull trend bar, so that they could short at what they consider\nto be an overdone rally. Other bears will short below the low of the bar, since they\nwill see this as a sign of weakness that could lead to a tradable reversal. Similarly,\nthere are proﬁt-taking bears and new bulls buying at the bottom of every bear trend\nbar, no matter how strong the bar appears to be, and there are other bears who are\nlooking to short near its high, and bulls looking to buy above its high.\nFor a trader, it is most useful to think of all bars as being either trend bars\nor nontrend (trading range) bars. Since the latter is an awkward term and most\nare similar to doji bars, it is simpler to refer to all nontrend bars as dojis. If the\nbody appears tiny or nonexistent on the chart, the bar is a doji; neither the bulls\nnor the bears controlled the bar, and the bar is essentially a one-bar trading range.\nOn a 5 minute Emini chart, a doji body is nonexistent or only a tick or two large,\ndepending on the size of the bar. However, on a daily or weekly Google chart, the\nbody can be 100 ticks (one dollar) or more and still have the same signiﬁcance as a\nperfect doji, and therefore it makes sense to refer to it as a doji. The determination\nis relative and subjective, and it depends on the market and the time frame. In\nall of trading, close is close enough and perfection is rare. If something closely\nresembles a pattern, what follows will likely be what would be expected to follow\nthe perfect pattern.\nSubdividing bars with small bodies into a variety of subtypes like hanging man,\nhammer, or harami adds little to a trader. The fundamental issue is whether the bar\nand market are trying to trend, realizing that most of the time it is something in\nbetween. It is far more important to ascertain the strength of any trend than it is to\nspend time worrying about a precise name for a particular bar. You make money\nby placing trades, not by worrying about lots of meaningless, colorful names.\nIf there is a body, then the close trended away from the open and the bar is a\ntrend bar. Obviously, if the bar is large and the body is small, there was not much\ntrending strength. Also, within the bar (as seen on a smaller time frame), there\nmay have been several swings of largely sideways movement, but this is irrelevant\nbecause you should focus on only one chart.

There are also other bulls who are looking for a pullback and will buy near the low of the bar if the market gets there. However, it is important to realize that there are other bulls who expect the strength to fail and they are using the strength as an opportunity to sell out of their longs and take proﬁts. There are also bears who see the bull trend bar, no matter how strong, as a climactic, failed effort by the bulls, and are shorting around the high of the bar. Some were sitting on the sidelines, waiting for a strong bull trend bar, so that they could short at what they consider to be an overdone rally. Other bears will short below the low of the bar, since they will see this as a sign of weakness that could lead to a tradable reversal. Similarly, there are proﬁt-taking bears and new bulls buying at the bottom of every bear trend bar, no matter how strong the bar appears to be, and there are other bears who are looking to short near its high, and bulls looking to buy above its high.\nFor a trader, it is most useful to think of all bars as being either trend bars or nontrend (trading range) bars. Since the latter is an awkward term and most are similar to doji bars, it is simpler to refer to all nontrend bars as dojis. If the body appears tiny or nonexistent on the chart, the bar is a doji; neither the bulls nor the bears controlled the bar, and the bar is essentially a one-bar trading range.\nOn a 5 minute Emini chart, a doji body is nonexistent or only a tick or two large, depending on the size of the bar. However, on a daily or weekly Google chart, the body can be 100 ticks (one dollar) or more and still have the same signiﬁcance as a perfect doji, and therefore it makes sense to refer to it as a doji. The determination is relative and subjective, and it depends on the market and the time frame. In all of trading, close is close enough and perfection is rare. If something closely resembles a pattern, what follows will likely be what would be expected to follow the perfect pattern.\nSubdividing bars with small bodies into a variety of subtypes like hanging man, hammer, or harami adds little to a trader. The fundamental issue is whether the bar and market are trying to trend, realizing that most of the time it is something in between. It is far more important to ascertain the strength of any trend than it is to spend time worrying about a precise name for a particular bar. You make money by placing trades, not by worrying about lots of meaningless, colorful names.\nIf there is a body, then the close trended away from the open and the bar is a trend bar. Obviously, if the bar is large and the body is small, there was not much trending strength. Also, within the bar (as seen on a smaller time frame), there may have been several swings of largely sideways movement, but this is irrelevant because you should focus on only one chart.

When the market breaks out into a trend, there is usually a trend bar, which\ncan be small or large, followed by many bars that are trending as the market spikes\naway from the trading range. One of the most important skills that a trader can de-\nvelop is the ability to reliably distinguish between a successful and a failed breakout\n(a reversal).

If there is a two-bar reversal that is sitting on or touching the bottom\nof the moving average and the two bars almost entirely overlap one or more prior\nbars, the breakout usually fails.

The second bar had a bull body but it also had prominent tails and it failed to get above the moving average. There was also no followthrough buying on the third bar, which also tested the moving average and failed to get above it. Bulls should have considered exiting their longs and waiting since the market was now in a small tight trading range below the moving average and the bars were large with tails. A tight trading range below the moving average usually breaks out to the downside, but there was no reliable short setup. Instead, traders should wait for a better setup.

Since the\nmarket was in a bear spike, selling the breakout below the bar 7 double bottom low was\na reasonable short. This is diﬀerent from the bar 18 micro double bottom (with the tail\nof the doji bar two bars earlier), which was in a pullback from a four bar bull spike, and\nnot in a bear spike.

Bar 11 formed a micro double top with the\nhigh of the bar two bars earlier, and became a low 2 bear ﬂag sell signal bar.\nBar 15 strongly broke above the bear trend line in Figure 6.15, and the gap down\nopening to bar 16 was a higher low buy setup for an expected second leg up.

The tails were small and the bodies were large, and more selling\nwas likely. Every large bear breakout is a sell climax but that does not mean that the\nmarket will reverse. This breakout looked strong and the bulls could generate only a\ntwo-bar pause after the sell climax before they were overwhelmed again by the bears.\nA breakout is not only a climax but a spike as well, and when the breakout is strong\nlike this, it is usually followed by a channel down before a tradable bottom develops.\nBears will be aggressively shorting every pause and every little pullback until a possible\nbottom forms.

Next, look at the open of the breakout bar to the close or\nlow of the ﬁnal strong bear trend bar of the breakout, which might be the bar before bar\n7 or the bar before that. It turns out that the bear trend bottomed at a measured move\nusing a projection down from the top of the spike to the low of the third and ﬁnal bear\nbar of the spike. You should also look for other possible measured move projections\nas well, because if the market tries to reverse within a couple of ticks of one of these\nmagnets, it should increase your conﬁdence to take the trade. However, you cannot take\nthe countertrend trade on a measured move alone since most fail and you have to keep\nlooking at others. The odds of success are too small.

Next, look at the open of the breakout bar to the close or low of the ﬁnal strong bear trend bar of the breakout, which might be the bar before bar 7 or the bar before that. It turns out that the bear trend bottomed at a measured move using a projection down from the top of the spike to the low of the third and ﬁnal bear bar of the spike. You should also look for other possible measured move projections as well, because if the market tries to reverse within a couple of ticks of one of these magnets, it should increase your conﬁdence to take the trade. However, you cannot take the countertrend trade on a measured move alone since most fail and you have to keep looking at others. The odds of success are too small.

Although the\nmarket was still in the bear channel of the past couple of hours, this is a good long\nscalp setup.\nBar 6 was a large bear trend bar with a big bottom tail and a close above the\nmidpoint of the bar, which can be enough of a show of strength by bulls to reverse\nthe market, especially after a collapse at the end of the bear trend.

You could either buy above this\nbar or wait. The second bar was a setup for a breakout pullback short for a trend from\nthe open bear day. The move down to bar 1 was a parabolic sell climax and therefore\na possible low of the day. Since the selling was strong, it would be better to wait for a\nsecond signal before buying, and it came eight bars later in the form of a higher low and\na failed breakout of a bear ﬂag.\nThe sell-oﬀto bar 3 broke a major trend line, alerting traders to short a test of the\nbar 2 high. The bar before bar 3 was a moving average gap bar buy setup in a strong\ntrend, so buying above it, even with an outside up bar, was a good trade. The move down\nto a 20 gap bars setup almost always breaks a trend line, and the move up from the bar\nusually tests the high of the trend with either a higher high or a lower high. If there is\nthen a reversal down, it usually leads to at least two legs lasting at least 10 bars and\noften a trend reversal.\nBar 3 was also the second bar of a two-bar reversal with the bear bar before it and\nwith the bear bar from two bars earlier, so many bulls bought above the high of bar 3.\nBar 4 was a large bull trend bar (climactic) that formed a higher high, and it was\nfollowed by a strong bear inside bar that was the signal for the short. Traders were ex-\npecting two legs down from such a strong setup.

It was a\nfailed high 2, and the long entry bar reversed into an outside bar down, trapping longs\nin and bears out.

You want it to contain (be above) the highs of all of the bars located in\nbetween the two bars used to create the trend line, so drag it to the high of whatever\nbar will leave it touching that bar alone.

However, be aware of the possibility\nthat the market might ultimately decide that the channel line should instead be\nacross that spike up. If the market begins to have wider swings and they all are\nstopping at the top of the channel that uses that one spike as the anchor for the\ntrend channel line, then you should use that wider channel.\nA trend channel line can also be created on its own, rather than as a parallel\nof the trend line. In a bear swing, a trend line will be downward sloping and above\nthe highs. The trend channel line will have a similar slope, but draw it between any\ntwo swing lows in the bear swing. It is most useful if it contains (is below) all of the\nother bars in the swing, so choose the bars that will give that result.\nTrend channel line overshoots are closely related to wedges and should be\nviewed and traded as if they are one and the same.

The wedges are less obvious and\nless likely to be present when the trend channel line is constructed as a parallel of\na trend line, but wedges are still often present.\nWhen a channel has a wedge shape, it is due to urgency. For example, in a\nwedge top, the slope of the trend line is greater than the slope of the trend chan-\nnel line. The trend line is where the with-trend traders enter and the countertrend\ntraders exit, and the opposite happens at the trend channel line. So if the slope of\nthe trend line is greater, that means that the bulls are buying on smaller pullbacks\nand the bears are exiting on smaller sell-offs. What ﬁrst distinguishes a wedge from\na channel where the lines are parallel is the second pullback. Once the second push\nup has begun to reverse down, traders can draw a trend channel line and then use\nit to create a parallel line. When they drag that parallel line to the bottom of the ﬁrst\npullback, they have created a trend line and a trend channel.

Yes, one side is\nstronger, but the principle is the same as for any trading range. For example, in a\nbull channel, both bulls and bears are active but the bulls are stronger and that is\nwhy the channel is sloping up. Both the bulls and the bears are comfortable placing\ntrades in the middle of the channel, but when the market gets near the top of the\nchannel, the bulls become concerned that the upside breakout will fail; and as soon\nas they think that a failure is likely, they will sell out of some of their longs. Also, the\nbears were comfortable shorting in the middle of the channel and will short even\nmore aggressively near the top, at a better value. When the market gets near the\nbottom of the range, the bears are less interested in shorting at these lower prices\nand the bulls, who were just buying moments ago at higher prices, will buy even\nmore aggressively here. This leads to a bounce up off of the trend line. The market\nusually pokes below the channel one or more times as it is forming, and you have\nto redraw the trend line. The result is usually a slightly broader and ﬂatter channel.\nUltimately, the downside breakout will be strong enough to be followed by a lower\nhigh and then a lower low, and when that happens, traders will begin to draw a bear\nchannel, even if the bull channel still exists, albeit much wider.\nIt is important to realize that most bull breakouts of bull channels fail. If the\nbulls are able to create a bull breakout and they can overwhelm the bears, they\nusually will be able to do so for only a few bars. At that point, the bulls will see\nthe market as too overdone and will take proﬁts; they won’t want to buy until the\nmarket has corrected for a while.

Both the bulls and the bears are comfortable placing trades in the middle of the channel, but when the market gets near the top of the channel, the bulls become concerned that the upside breakout will fail; and as soon as they think that a failure is likely, they will sell out of some of their longs.

When the market gets near the bottom of the range, the bears are less interested in shorting at these lower prices and the bulls, who were just buying moments ago at higher prices, will buy even more aggressively here.

Trend channels usually last much longer than what most traders\nsuspect and they often trap traders into prematurely taking reversal trades. Most\nchannels usually have at least three legs before they end. This is especially clear\nin triangles, and in wedges in particular. With triangles, the breakout is usually\nimminent but the direction is often not clear.\nThe steeper the slope and the closer together the lines are, the stronger the\nchannel is and the stronger the momentum is. When a channel is steep and tight, it\nis a special type of channel called a tight channel. When it is horizontal, it is a tight\ntrading range, which is discussed in book 2. When a channel is strong, it is risky\nto trade the ﬁrst breakout against the trend, and it is likely that the entire channel\nwill be a spike on a higher time frame chart. So if there is a steep bear channel and\nmost of the pullbacks within the channel have been only a single bar, it is better not\nto buy one of those breakouts above the prior bar, even if it breaks above the bear\ntrend line. Instead, it is better to wait to see if there is a breakout pullback, which\ncan be a lower low or a higher low. If there is and the reversal up looks strong\n(for example, maybe there were two or three good-sized bull trend bars within the\npast several bars), then you can consider buying the breakout pullback. If there is\nno pullback and the market races upward, then the odds of even higher prices are\ngood and you can wait for any pullback, which should come within ﬁve bars or\nso.

Bull and bear micro channels can develop in bull or\nbear trends, and in trading ranges. The environment in which they occur determines\nhow to trade them. Both bull and bear channels can have breakouts to the upside\nor the downside. As with all breakouts, three things can then happen: it can be suc-\ncessful and be followed by more trading in that direction, it can fail and become\na small climactic reversal, or the market can just go sideways and the pattern can\nevolve into a trading range.\nAs with any breakout, traders will trade either in the direction of the breakout,\nexpecting follow-through, or in the opposite direction, if they expect the breakout\nto fail. Breakouts, failed breakouts, and breakout pullbacks are closely related and\nare discussed in book 2. As a guide, traders compare the strength of the breakout\nwith that of the reversal attempt. If one is clearly stronger, the market will likely go\nin that direction. If they are equally strong, the trader needs to wait for more bars\nbefore deciding where the market is likely to go next.\nWhen a bear micro channel forms in a bull trend, it is usually a bull ﬂag, or the\nlast leg of a bull ﬂag, and traders will look for a signal bar and then place a buy stop\nabove its high to enter on the breakout of the bear micro channel and of the bull\nﬂag. When a bull micro channel forms in a bear trend, it is usually a bear ﬂag or the\nﬁnal leg of a bear ﬂag and traders will short below any signal bar.\nIf instead of a bear micro channel forming in a bull ﬂag, the micro channel is a\nrising micro channel (a bull micro channel) in a bull trend, the ﬁrst downside break-\nout (the ﬁrst pullback) will usually not go far, and it will be bought aggressively. The\nmore bars in the bull micro channel, the more likely that the bear breakout will not\nreverse the bull trend. For example, if there is a ﬁve-bar bull micro channel in a bull\ntrend, there will probably be far more buyers at and below the low of that ﬁfth bar\nthan sellers. If the market trades below that ﬁfth bar, the bar creates a bear break-\nout of the bull channel. However, it is unlikely to lead to more than a bar or two of\nselling because the bulls will be eager to buy the ﬁrst pullback from the strong mi-\ncro channel bull trend. Remember, many traders have been watching the rally for\nﬁve bars, waiting for any pullback to buy. They will be eager to buy below the ﬁfth\nbar and above the high of the pullback bar, which is a failed breakout buy signal\nbar (a high 1 buy setup). If the market triggers the long but creates a bear reversal\nbar within a bar or two, this then sets up a micro double top sell signal. It can also\nbe thought of as a pullback from the breakout below the bull micro channel, even\nif its high is above the highest bar in the micro channel. It would then be simply a\nhigher high reversal, which is a micro version of a major trend reversal (reversals\nare discussed in book 3).\n", "text_clean": "TREND LINES AND CHANNELS\ntrend begins breaking above resistance levels, breakout programs will start trading.\nSome will trade in the direction of the trend and others will begin to scale in against the trend, or scale out of longs that they bought lower.\nEventually one of the bars penetrates through the trend line or the trend channel line, creating a breakout.

For example, if there is a ﬁve-bar bull micro channel in a bull trend, there will probably be far more buyers at and below the low of that ﬁfth bar than sellers. If the market trades below that ﬁfth bar, the bar creates a bear breakout of the bull channel. However, it is unlikely to lead to more than a bar or two of selling because the bulls will be eager to buy the ﬁrst pullback from the strong micro channel bull trend. Remember, many traders have been watching the rally for ﬁve bars, waiting for any pullback to buy. They will be eager to buy below the ﬁfth bar and above the high of the pullback bar, which is a failed breakout buy signal bar (a high 1 buy setup). If the market triggers the long but creates a bear reversal bar within a bar or two, this then sets up a micro double top sell signal. It can also be thought of as a pullback from the breakout below the bull micro channel, even if its high is above the highest bar in the micro channel. It would then be simply a higher high reversal, which is a micro version of a major trend reversal (reversals are discussed in book 3).", "noise_score": 0.0, "is_noise": false, "heading_lines": ["TREND LINES AND CHANNELS", "trend begins breaking above resistance levels, breakout programs will start trading.", "Some will trade in the direction of the trend and others will begin to scale in against", "the trend, or scale out of longs that they bought lower.", "Eventually one of the bars penetrates through the trend line or the trend channel line, creating a breakout.

Traders reversed to short\nas the bar went outside down.

The third bar was a strong bear bar and therefore a spike down, but the market might just be forming a higher low before the rally resumes. Instead, the market traded above the higher low and then reversed down in an outside bar down (bar 1), triggering a breakout pullback short entry. The gap down was the breakout, and the failed breakout and attempt to rally failed and became a breakout pullback for a resumption of the bear breakout. Traders reversed to short as the bar went outside down. Other traders shorted below the low of the outside down bar, and others shorted below the low of the bull reversal bar (the ﬁrst bar of the day).\nThe day became a large trend from the open bear day as the market traded in a tight channel down to bar 5. The channel was so tight that it was eﬀectively just a spike. The market pulled back to the moving average and then a bear channel unfolded down to the bar 10 low of the day.\nMost failed micro trend line trades are low 1 entries in bear trends and high 1 entries in bull trends. Bar 9 was a low 1 sell setup. Bar 11 was a high 1 buy setup; it was the ﬁrst higher low in the new bull leg, and a higher low after a possible trend reversal into a bull is a good buy setup.

As the market goes above the high of the\nﬁrst leg up, it is breaking out above a prior swing high in a minor bull trend. How-\never, since most traders will see the move up as a pullback that will end very soon,\nthe dominant traders on the breakout will usually be aggressive sellers, instead of\naggressive new buyers or proﬁt-taking longs, and the minor bull trend will usually\nreverse back down into the direction of the major bear trend after breaking out\nabove the ﬁrst or second swing high in the pullback.\nThe same is true of new lows in a bear trend. When the bear trend is strong,\nstrong bears will press their shorts by adding to their positions on the breakout to a\nnew low and the market will continue to fall until it reaches some measured move\ntarget. As the trend weakens, the price action at a new low will be less clear, which\nmeans that the strong bears are using the new low as an area to take proﬁts on their\nshorts rather than as an area to add to their shorts. As the bear trend further loses\nstrength, eventually the strong bulls will see a new low as a great price to initiate\nlongs and they will be able to create a reversal pattern and then a signiﬁcant rally.\nAs a trend matures, it usually transitions into a trading range, but the ﬁrst trad-\ning ranges that form are usually followed by a continuation of the trend. How do\nthe strong bulls and bears act as a trend matures? In a bull trend, when the trend\nis strong, the pullbacks are small because the strong bulls want to buy more on a\npullback. Since they suspect that there may not be a pullback until the market is\nmuch higher, they begin to buy in pieces, but relentlessly. They look for any reason\nto buy, and with so many big traders in the market, there will be some buying for\nevery imaginable reason. They place limit orders to buy a few ticks down and other\nlimit orders to buy a few ticks above the low of the prior bar, at the low of the prior\nbar, and below the low of the prior bar. They place stop orders to buy above the\nhigh of the prior bar and on a breakout above any prior swing high. They also buy\non the close of both any bull or bear trend bar. They see the bear trend bar as a\nbrief opportunity to buy at a better price and the bull trend bar as a sign that the\nmarket is about to move up quickly.\nThe strong bears are smart and they see what is going on. Since they believe,\njust like the strong bulls, that the market is going to be higher before long, it does\nnot make sense for them to be shorting. They just step aside and wait until they\ncan sell higher. How much higher? Each institution has its own measure of excess,\nbut once the market gets to a price level where enough bear ﬁrms believe that it\nmight not go any higher, they will begin to short. If enough of them short around\nthe same price level, more and larger bear trend bars form and bars start to get\ntails on the tops.

The strong bulls\neventually stop buying above the last swing high and instead begin to take proﬁts\nas the market goes to a new high.

As the bear trend further loses strength, eventually the strong bulls will see a new low as a great price to initiate longs and they will be able to create a reversal pattern and then a signiﬁcant rally.\nAs a trend matures, it usually transitions into a trading range, but the ﬁrst trading ranges that form are usually followed by a continuation of the trend. How do the strong bulls and bears act as a trend matures? In a bull trend, when the trend is strong, the pullbacks are small because the strong bulls want to buy more on a pullback. Since they suspect that there may not be a pullback until the market is much higher, they begin to buy in pieces, but relentlessly. They look for any reason to buy, and with so many big traders in the market, there will be some buying for every imaginable reason. They place limit orders to buy a few ticks down and other limit orders to buy a few ticks above the low of the prior bar, at the low of the prior bar, and below the low of the prior bar. They place stop orders to buy above the high of the prior bar and on a breakout above any prior swing high. They also buy on the close of both any bull or bear trend bar. They see the bear trend bar as a brief opportunity to buy at a better price and the bull trend bar as a sign that the market is about to move up quickly.\nThe strong bears are smart and they see what is going on. Since they believe, just like the strong bulls, that the market is going to be higher before long, it does not make sense for them to be shorting. They just step aside and wait until they can sell higher. How much higher? Each institution has its own measure of excess, but once the market gets to a price level where enough bear ﬁrms believe that it might not go any higher, they will begin to short. If enough of them short around the same price level, more and larger bear trend bars form and bars start to get tails on the tops. These are signs of selling pressure and they tell all traders that the bulls are becoming weaker and the bears are becoming stronger. The strong bulls eventually stop buying above the last swing high and instead begin to take proﬁts as the market goes to a new high. They are still bullish but are becoming selective and will buy only on pullbacks.

The bears will expect\nthat a breakout above a prior swing high in this small bull trend will fail, and\nthey will short there with a limit order.\nr A trader can always be long, short, or ﬂat. At any moment during a trend, only\ntwo of those choices are compatible with being a successful trader. If the mar-\nket is in a bull trend, successful traders are only long or ﬂat. If it is in a bear\ntrend, they are either short or ﬂat. A tiny fraction of traders have the ability to\nconsistently make money by trading against a trend, and you should assume\nthat you are not part of that group.

You now know the answer.\nEvery type of market does something to make trading difﬁcult.

Some traders had their protective stops below\nbar 6 since it was a strong bull trend bar, and a strong bull trend usually would\nnot fall below such a bar. Therefore, buying just above its low was a low-risk, high-\nreward trade with at least a 50 percent chance of success. They also could have\nbought above the bull reversal bar that followed bar 8 since it was a double bottom\nbull ﬂag setup and a high 2 long (bar 6 was the high 1).\nBar 9 was another break below a bull micro channel, and traders expected it\nto fail. Some would have had limit orders to buy at the low of the prior bar as the\nmicro channel was growing, and they would have been ﬁlled on bar 9. Other traders\nbought above the bar 9 high as a failed breakout below the bull micro channel.\nBar 11 was another high 2 buy setup, but the market had been mostly sideways\nfor over 10 bars, and the bars were getting small. Although this was also a double\nbottom buy signal, the tight trading range could have continued, so many traders\nwould have waited to see if there was a third push down and then looked to buy\nabove the wedge bull ﬂag, which some traders would have seen as a triangle, since\nit would have been sideways instead of down.

This was a high 2 entry bar since bar 13\nwas a high 1 entry and the pullback below the next bar was a second leg down in\nthis four-bar-long tight trading range.\nSome traders bought as the market broke above bar 10, which they saw as a\nbreakout of a trading range in a bull trend. Traders also bought the close of bar 14\nand above its high. The next bar had good follow-through, which was a sign of\nstrength, and traders therefore bought its close and above its high.

They are content ﬁlling their orders in man-\nageable pieces all day long, understanding that they are buying higher and higher,\nbut knowing that the market will likely go higher still. Also, strong days like this\nusually have higher prices over the next one to several days.\nDeeper Discussion of This Chart\nThe market broke out above yesterday’s high in Figure 19.1, but the breakout became\na failed breakout when the market turned down below the bear inside bar that followed\nthe bar 2 strong bull spike. Big gap up days often test the low of the open and form a\nsmall double bottom bull ﬂag. When the opening range is small like this, that market is\nin breakout mode and traders will enter in the direction of the breakout. On a big gap\nup day, the odds favor an upside breakout. Aggressive bulls could enter above bar 3,\nbased on the double bottom, but many bulls entered on a stop above the bar 2 high\nof the opening range. The day was a trend from the open bull trend day and a trend\nresumption bull day.\nThe market had a small two-legged move down to bar 3. A bear trend bar and two\ndojis composed the ﬁrst leg. The second leg was made up of a bear trend bar with a\nlarge bear tail on top (the tail was the pullback that ended the ﬁrst leg down) followed\nby a doji. This variant of a two-legged move would certainly have two clear legs down on\na smaller time frame chart, setting up an ABC buy signal. A trader could buy at one tick\nabove bar 3. It was also a test of the gap, forming a double bottom with the low of bar\n1. Since this was a possible trend day and as such could extend much further than most\ntraders would ever suspect, smart traders would swing part or all of their positions. Note\nhow the open of the day was very close to the low of the day, which is a sign of strength,\nand trend from the open days that open within a few ticks of the low of the day often\nclose within a few ticks of the high of the day, and there is often a trend into the close.\nBar 5 was a high 1 breakout pullback after a strong move up (four bull trend bars),\nand a high 1 is always a good buy in the spike phase of a strong bull trend.

Big gap up days often test the low of the open and form a small double bottom bull ﬂag. When the opening range is small like this, that market is in breakout mode and traders will enter in the direction of the breakout. On a big gap up day, the odds favor an upside breakout. Aggressive bulls could enter above bar 3, based on the double bottom, but many bulls entered on a stop above the bar 2 high of the opening range. The day was a trend from the open bull trend day and a trend resumption bull day.\nThe market had a small two-legged move down to bar 3. A bear trend bar and two dojis composed the ﬁrst leg. The second leg was made up of a bear trend bar with a large bear tail on top (the tail was the pullback that ended the ﬁrst leg down) followed by a doji. This variant of a two-legged move would certainly have two clear legs down on a smaller time frame chart, setting up an ABC buy signal. A trader could buy at one tick above bar 3. It was also a test of the gap, forming a double bottom with the low of bar 1. Since this was a possible trend day and as such could extend much further than most traders would ever suspect, smart traders would swing part or all of their positions.

The bulls will keep buying as\nthey try to create a bull channel to follow their bull spike, and the bears will keep\nselling as they try to create a bear channel to follow their bear spike.

For example, if there is a bull spike\nand then a trading range, in about a third of cases the market will break out of the\nbottom of the trading range instead of the top.

Remember that a channel, no matter\nhow steep, is a ﬂag in the opposite direction. A bull channel is a bear ﬂag and a\nbear channel is a bull ﬂag. Also, even though a channel is a sloping trading range, it\nis also the ﬁrst leg of a larger trading range, and the reversal is usually to the area\naround the start of the channel. For example, if there is a spike up, then a pullback,\nand then a bull channel, the bull channel is usually the ﬁrst leg of a trading range\nthat has yet to unfold. The market will usually correct down to the bottom of the\nchannel, where it will try to form a double bottom bull ﬂag with the bottom of the\nchannel. This usually leads to a bounce, which is the third leg of the developing\ntrading range. After the bounce, traders should begin to look for other patterns\nbecause the predictability of the spike and channel pattern at this point has ended.\nA spike is a breakout, which means that there will be a gap between the breakout\npoint and the ﬁrst pullback, which is the start of the channel. The test to the bottom\nof the channel is a test of the gap and is a breakout test.\nStock traders often describe the end of a bull channel as a crowded trade be-\ncause they believe that anyone interested in the stock has gone long and there is\nno one left to buy. They then expect a fast sell-off down to the start of the channel\nas all of the channel buyers exit. As the stock quickly falls, they think of the bear\nleg as being caused by all of the late-entering bulls with open losses quickly exit-\ning to minimize those losses. That rush to the exits by the crowd of bulls leads to\nthe rapidity and depth of the sell-off. There are obviously many factors that inﬂu-\nence every move, but this is likely an important component when there is a sharp\ncorrection down to the start of the channel.\nSince the second part of the pattern is a channel, the behavior during the chan-\nnel phase is like that of any other channel.

It is important to understand that\nany breakout pullback can test the old extreme with either a lower high, a double\ntop, or a higher high, and that test can often be the start of the bear channel. Al-\nthough it may appear that the small spike down began the bear trend and that the\nchannel that followed it was the ﬁrst bear channel, sometimes the earlier spike is\nmore inﬂuential. Its channel can begin at the high of the bull trend, and it can begin\nwith that smaller spike down from the high. The channel that follows that small\nbear spike is then inside the larger channel that began at the bull high, just before\nthat small bear spike formed.\nWhen the market is in a trading range, it often has both a bull spike and a\nbear spike. The bulls and bears then ﬁght to create a channel. Eventually one\nside will dominate and will be able to form a trend channel. It often begins with a\nbreakout, which is then a second spike. Both spikes contribute to the formation of\nthe channel.\nA bull channel is a bear ﬂag and a bear channel is a bull ﬂag, and like all ﬂags\nthey are continuation patterns that usually break out in the direction of the trend.\nHowever, sometimes they break out in the opposite direction, leading to a trend re-\nversal. The breakout is a spike, so instead of a spike and channel trend, the market\nforms a channel and spike trend that is unrelated to a spike and channel pattern.\nBut usually the spike is followed by a channel. For example, if there is a bear trend\nand it has a pullback, the pullback is a rising channel and therefore a bear ﬂag.\nSometimes the channel will break out to the upside.

The market also often retraces into the prior trading range later\nin the day, and since 11:30 a.m. PST is a common time for reversals, the odds of a failed\nbreakout and ﬁnal ﬂag reversal were high. The pullback could have tested the bar 4 start\nof the bull channel, so bears were happy shorting at the high of a large bull trend bar\nbreakout above a swing high and potential ﬁnal ﬂag. Many would have scaled into more\nshorts higher, believing that the market had a 70 percent chance or better of at least\ntesting their ﬁrst short entry price before the close. This would have enabled them to\nexit their original shorts at breakeven and decide whether to exit their shorts from above\nwith a proﬁt or to move the protective stops to breakeven and swing the trade down.\nBar 2 was the ﬁrst bar of a two-bar reversal up from a possible failed low 2 from\na double or triple bottom, and the start of a bull trend. Traders were aware that the\nmarket could break out and run. Once the market broke out, it formed a higher range\nfrom bars 4 to 6, and that range contained two small tight trading ranges. The high 2\nlong above bar 5 was a reasonable breakout pullback entry, despite the barbwire. The\nbreakout was both from the small bull ﬂag from bar 3 to bar 4, and from the entire bar 3\nto bar 5 trading range, which was a two-legged sideways pullback from the breakout\nabove bar 1.\nThe market broke out to a third range, from bars 8 to 9. When it broke out again, it\nfailed at bar 10 (a ﬁnal ﬂag reversal) and retraced through the bottom of the third range\nand ultimately to the bottom of the second range.

First, the market might have\ngone too far too fast and be experiencing exhaustive climactic behavior. For ex-\nample, if there is then a pause or pullback like an inside bar or a small wedge ﬂag,\nthis could become a ﬁnal ﬂag and lead to a reversal after a small breakout, and the\nreversal could last for several hours.

Experienced\ntraders see all of these things as signs that the bull trend is very strong, and this\ngives them the conﬁdence to take swing trades. They correctly know that, although\nthe bars look like they are part of a weak channel and therefore should create low-\nprobability setups, when they occur in a small pullback bull trend day, they form\nhigh-probability swing setups. All pullbacks in trend from the open days are great\nwith trend entries, even though they almost always look weak. A trader can con-\ntinue to have conﬁdence entering with trend even after a pullback ﬁnally breaks\na meaningful trend line. In a strong bull trend, look to buy at the low of the prior\nbar, or one or two ticks below its low, or on a stop at one tick above high 1 and\nhigh 2 setups. Look at the size of the pullbacks since the trend began. For example,\nin a small pullback bull trend, if the largest pullback in the past couple of hours has\nbeen only eight ticks, buy with a limit order at ﬁve to seven ticks below the high\nof the day. In strong bear trends, traders will do the opposite and short at the high\nof the prior bar or one or two ticks above it, on a stop at one tick below low 1 and\nlow 2 signal bars, and on any bounce that is about the size of an average bar.\nThe market has inertia and the ﬁrst attempt to end the trend usually fails. Once\na trend line has been broken and there has been a signiﬁcant pullback, then the ﬁrst\nleg of the trend has likely ended. Even then, the ﬁrst break of the trend line has high\nodds of setting up a with-trend entry that will lead to a second trend leg and a new\nextreme in the trend.\nThe pullbacks often have weak signal bars, and there are many countertrend\ntrend bars. For example, in a strong bull trend, most of the buy signal bars might\nbe small bear trend bars or doji bars, and several of the entry bars might be outside\nup bars with small bodies. They often follow two or three consecutive bear trend\nbars or bear micro channels. This constant selling pressure makes many traders\nlook for sell signals, trapping them out of the bull trend. The sell signals never look\nquite strong enough, but the traders sell anyway because they look better than the\nbuy signals, and they want to trade. They see that there was a pullback after just\nabout every buy signal that comes back and hits a breakeven stop and think that\nthis is a sign of a weak bull trend. They see that it is a bull trend and want to get\nlong, but can’t ﬁgure out how to do so, because they think every buy signal looks\nbad. The pullbacks are too small and the setups are too weak. Also, since these\ndays happen only a couple of times a month, they are conditioned to the other\ndays, when selling pressure usually leads to a tradable short, so they continue to\nshort sell setups that don’t quite look right. They don’t look right because they are\nthe start of bull ﬂags, not reversals.

In a strong bull trend, look to buy at the low of the prior bar, or one or two ticks below its low, or on a stop at one tick above high 1 and high 2 setups. Look at the size of the pullbacks since the trend began. For example, in a small pullback bull trend, if the largest pullback in the past couple of hours has been only eight ticks, buy with a limit order at ﬁve to seven ticks below the high of the day. In strong bear trends, traders will do the opposite and short at the high of the prior bar or one or two ticks above it, on a stop at one tick below low 1 and low 2 signal bars, and on any bounce that is about the size of an average bar.\nThe market has inertia and the ﬁrst attempt to end the trend usually fails. Once a trend line has been broken and there has been a signiﬁcant pullback, then the ﬁrst leg of the trend has likely ended. Even then, the ﬁrst break of the trend line has high odds of setting up a with-trend entry that will lead to a second trend leg and a new extreme in the trend.\nThe pullbacks often have weak signal bars, and there are many countertrend trend bars. For example, in a strong bull trend, most of the buy signal bars might be small bear trend bars or doji bars, and several of the entry bars might be outside up bars with small bodies. They often follow two or three consecutive bear trend bars or bear micro channels. This constant selling pressure makes many traders look for sell signals, trapping them out of the bull trend. The sell signals never look quite strong enough, but the traders sell anyway because they look better than the buy signals, and they want to trade. They see that there was a pullback after just about every buy signal that comes back and hits a breakeven stop and think that this is a sign of a weak bull trend. They see that it is a bull trend and want to get long, but can’t ﬁgure out how to do so, because they think every buy signal looks bad. The pullbacks are too small and the setups are too weak. Also, since these days happen only a couple of times a month, they are conditioned to the other days, when selling pressure usually leads to a tradable short, so they continue to short sell setups that don’t quite look right. They don’t look right because they are the start of bull ﬂags, not reversals.

It\nwas also close enough to a breakout below yesterday’s low to behave like a pullback\nfrom an actual breakout (close is close enough). The eagerness of the bears to short\nprevented that ﬁrst pullback from reaching the moving average. They were afraid that\nit might not get there and therefore shorted so heavily on the approach that it never\nreached the moving average target. When the pullback turns back down just below the\nmoving average, the bears are very aggressive and have a sense of urgency. They are\nvery eager to short, even at relatively low prices, so lower prices are likely to follow.\nBar 19 was a spike up, and a channel up began with the bar 20 higher low. The bar\nafter bar 20 was also a spike that ended with a three-bar channel at bar 21, the ﬁnal bar\non the chart.\nYesterday also had spike and channel activity, such as the spike up to bar 2 and the\nchannel that began with either bar 3 or bar 5. The move from bar 5 to bar 6 was another\nspike, as was the bar before bar 7. The channel for both began with the bar 8 low. The\nentire move up from bar 5 to bar 7 was probably a spike on a higher time frame chart.\nYesterday’s bull channel into the close poked above the trend channel line, which\nwas drawn as a parallel of the bull trend line from bar 5 to bar 9. Once the market\nreversed back into the channel on the bar 12 ﬁrst bar of the day, it was likely to poke\nthrough the bottom of the channel at a minimum. The next target is a measured move\ndown using the vertical height of the channel, and the target after that is the bottom of\nthe channel from yesterday, which was the bar 8 low. Since the move up to bar 11 had\na wedge shape and the market tested below the start of the wedge, the next downside\ntarget is a measured move down. Use the height of the wedge (the bar 11 high minus\nthe bar 8 low) and subtract that from the bar 8 bottom of the wedge. This target was\nexceeded during the sell-oﬀbelow bar 17.\nBar 19 was a reversal up from a second break below a bear trend channel line (drawn\nparallel to the bar 15 to bar 17 trend line), so two legs up were likely. Bar 18 tried to\nreverse up from a tiny poke below the trend channel line, but the market never went\nabove the high of the two-bar reversal so there was no long entry.\nIt is important to realize that although yesterday ended with a wedge top, there was\nstill a strong bull trend into the close.

They are very eager to short, even at relatively low prices, so lower prices are likely to follow.\nBar 19 was a spike up, and a channel up began with the bar 20 higher low. The bar after bar 20 was also a spike that ended with a three-bar channel at bar 21, the ﬁnal bar on the chart.\nYesterday also had spike and channel activity, such as the spike up to bar 2 and the channel that began with either bar 3 or bar 5.

Once the market reversed back into the channel on the bar 12 ﬁrst bar of the day, it was likely to poke through the bottom of the channel at a minimum. The next target is a measured move down using the vertical height of the channel, and the target after that is the bottom of the channel from yesterday, which was the bar 8 low. Since the move up to bar 11 had a wedge shape and the market tested below the start of the wedge, the next downside target is a measured move down. Use the height of the wedge (the bar 11 high minus the bar 8 low) and subtract that from the bar 8 bottom of the wedge. This target was exceeded during the sell-oﬀbelow bar 17.\nBar 19 was a reversal up from a second break below a bear trend channel line (drawn parallel to the bar 15 to bar 17 trend line), so two legs up were likely. Bar 18 tried to reverse up from a tiny poke below the trend channel line, but the market never went above the high of the two-bar reversal so there was no long entry.\nIt is important to realize that although yesterday ended with a wedge top, there was still a strong bull trend into the close.
